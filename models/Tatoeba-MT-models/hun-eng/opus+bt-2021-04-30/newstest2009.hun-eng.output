The Prague stock market was down by the end of the trade
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the rapid fall in the morning.
Transactions in shares in the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) reached nearly half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its Monday fall immediately from the start of Tuesday's trade when it fell almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Shares falling in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic drop in shares on Tuesday, although some of the losses were eventually cancelled during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market index described almost four percent during trading, but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, monitoring Chinese shares, dropped 3.8 percent, and markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market dropped 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Finance Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its financial policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should immediately resume negotiations and accept the financial system's proposal for support.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will feel the consequences of this.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft financial system support on Monday, to which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion crowns) should have been spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush says the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, US shares experienced a bloodbath and leading stock indices recorded the largest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell almost seven percent, a similar rate of fall was most recently experienced in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House of Representatives, the index began to fall free.
Congress withdrew: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
Supreme leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
U.S. legislators have made a breakthrough in negotiations for the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion krona).
But there's no victory yet.
Congress must complete some details of the agreement before they can make public the final form of the law and their vote.
The draft funding for the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was informed Sunday by Reuters news agency Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Organizations.
According to Senate sources, they are likely to vote on the draft as soon as possible on Wednesday.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in reviving the financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, a "equilibrium" will then take place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have resolved our differing views on what the form of a package to stabilise the market should be," said Bloomberg agency Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to him, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Legislative representatives met Henry Paulson, the U.S. Finance Minister, on Saturday night to give a final form to the government fund.
This should buy from financial companies the unsellable mortgage activities that lead financial firms to heavy losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
"We are close to the final agreement on a draft that will work and which should also be effective on the market.
The reform plan still needs to be continued, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signal to Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling violently.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators therefore seek to reach a final settlement in Congress on Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before trading in the Asian financial markets, where the decision of Congress could be the first to influence trading on Monday due to the time zone.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress are voting on the law, nor is it whether the trial can be stalled at the last minute due to a problem.
Legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
As requested by President George Bush, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the issuance of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it feels that the program does not fulfil its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire financial assets for the acquisition of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The law should be able for the House of Representatives to vote on Sunday and for the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesperson, stated that the president was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and appreciates the "bipartisan efforts made to stabilise our financial markets and defend our economy".
Limitation of Bushy severance payments
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, who led the negotiations, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of benefits, and the timing of the funding draft.
The new law also limits the so-called busy severance payments of the directors involved in the programme and establishes a board of supervisors of the fund.
The fund should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and which will be useful to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help to homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayment instalments at the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
According to David Marek, the chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed draft is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"All because it is not possible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be acquired.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government distribute losses among themselves," said Marek to iHNed.cz website this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
"It is much more important for Congress to decide already this week to support the plan and to give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of agreeing that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," stressed Marek.
Couple fight at blade edge: MP3 players versus mobiles.
Helping You Choose
While almost all mobiles are able to play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-end high-end record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl records, but there are no objective reasons for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if his shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, he probably dreams of such a record player.
This is similar to travel, or compact - simplistic with MP3 music.
Price and quality categories exist here too.
For some, it may be unacceptable to release eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a 20-kroner market earpiece.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough room.
There's a wide selection.
The life of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply play music, but also what most mobiles can't possibly do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calls and text messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better-worst camera, or even navigate.
And considering the smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
A multi-function mobile has its drawbacks.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more times the display sends it to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly this is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap cell phones, count on them not playing for you for more than a few hours.
If you're even on the phone here and there, get another charger at your workplace just in case - this applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will have no such problems, even the worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one upload.
The Next Problem arises when uploading music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without an adapter with miniature memory cards used in mobiles.
Players do not need any special software with some exceptions (iPod).
Enough to upload music from the computer via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a music library in order based on the performer himself, the album, the name of the genre, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices only depict a tree structure like Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
In selecting the specific equipment, ask primarily about battery life, memory capacity, sound output quality and type, and of course also about the comfort of the treatment.
If the music is primarily a background for you and you listen to it only briefly daily, for example, on the tram, whatever MP3 cell phone is suitable for you.
And that's what any cell phone can do.
You don't have to pay particular attention to the musical formats the mobile or player can use.
The MP3 will all cope and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is among the most common and, in addition to it, the vast majority of devices cope with WMA format music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) occurs less.
Better mobiles also make it possible to buy music on-line, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the service provider (or other service provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a strong argument for purchasing a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is lousy and is usually limited to one-summer radio hits.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that such a way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, your cell phone is in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it still depends on whether he always carries the headphones or at least the speakerphones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which is available to almost all mobile players, but only few MP3 players.
For many, music mobiles are likely to have the greatest advantage of price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand kroner, you can get enough decent walkmans.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of traditional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to fifteen thousand kroner with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones.
The advantage of players is, however, simple handling.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) are indeed dealt with by everyone.
Minimum function, previously similar to a standard cassette recorder or gramophone, is evident.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of an inadvertently turned-on mobile internet, nor in relation to the subsequent huge bill for data transmission.
What kind of device should we choose?
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually have an opening for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By buying the right card, you can buy up to two thousand kroner.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do anything with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If it belongs to more demanding students, choose special mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs) instead.
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson reached the farthest in the sector, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the aforementioned brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - the virtual service provider that forces classical service providers to substantially reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be like this much longer.
We have already written on Mobil.cz that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
After the latest European Commission move to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation - text messages sent from abroad to some Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than domestics.
How is it possible that Czech prices are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, the competition that really wants to fight is lacking.
This may sound controversial, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, has often agreed with this, who has previously stated a few times that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classic service provider, with its own network, may not have much chance (although it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is one more option - the virtual service provider.
The entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has brought about a significant price reduction, after which classical service providers also had to react.
Meanwhile, even before big fish such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to ours were heard in Britain.
However, it has been demonstrated that such providers have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year we informed you about the start of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than half a year, this provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest provider there.
In the meantime, Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate effectively, you need a lot less customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high costs of building, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world thus generally appear as low-cost - offering cheap calls and text messages, which are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it is a pretty good move to bet on a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking service provider - whom they like, whom they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is hard to say whether the idea of Poland can work for us.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segment approach on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it has been relatively satisfied with the offer of services."
Not a chance in the Czech Republic, mobile operators claim
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem very hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched more in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for Penta financial group in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
This indirectly demonstrated that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying their best to avoid any potential competition.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in launching the virtual service provider, which is therefore intended to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing our customers not only wired but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
This option has been discussed again with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesperson.
Maybe now's a good time.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual service provider will be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence for the time being.
"At this moment, we do not think that a full virtual service provider should have a place on the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been addressed by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about the press department of Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02.
Other operators also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, exceptionally agreeing with O2, adds: "So far, we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally advantageous business projects on which it could be further based."
And he added, "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up.
At this moment, we should have a specific agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone prefers to turn its attention to meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, primarily in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider to be the most rewarding in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is a match to build networks shared for fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - on the same line with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, with the entry of another operator leading to an increase in competition, a reduction in prices and a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier for a competition like this to enter?
When something is important to service providers, they are able to cooperate, as well as the huzavona around the birth of U:fon.
ČTÚ was probably under the greatest pressure around the birth of T-Mobile's U:phone.
This is borne out by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But right now, U:fon is a good argument as to why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of the competition in the mobile market was recently influenced by the market access of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be subject to high requirements."
However, given this attitude by mobile operators, the total lack of interest of Czech regulators is quite amazing.
In the meantime, it is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
Only the Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office has a characteristic attitude towards the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would be possible only after the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual service provider was concluded to lease the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not of sufficient interest to traditional service providers," said Kristián Chlapua of the Department of External Relations of the Competition Office.
A statement thus formulated from representatives of service providers would not be likely to surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and, in addition to others, make sure that no one can abuse their market position, this is more than odd.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds, "Outland, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile phone services."
However, there is probably no pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and on the reduction of prices in the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is indeed shocking to see quite touching harmony from the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question whether it's really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As with filling stations, the exact same petrol prices are certainly just the works of chance and tough competition.
"The office has not discovered signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately greater responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably also missing by the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leadership situation is one of many points of debate.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no Czech operator is in a leading position after such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So it is necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it would have to be at least a warning to ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting conspicuously in the same way.
In the meantime, complaints from a range of interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they encounter very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
Transferring responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications with which the UOHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We've met this before in some of the same situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the extension of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition could not be carried through in telecommunications, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
This is something that the representatives of the U.S.O.S. should know well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one's watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service provider, many of which already operate in the Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but which are only partially public.
They're multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic company client opposite the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar withdrawals.
"If cases were to arise that you are talking about, it could be a breach of contract terms that we would be dealing with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," replied Martina Kemrová to our question about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that news of such activity would not reach the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned may have thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider defends itself against such proceedings.
These companies have not negligible profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phone, so they cannot have this in full as general customers of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what the ČTÚ should think.
In addition, another question arises for the UOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why do they prevent the virtual service provider from being born?
It should be added that the U.S. has a relatively strong power to expose such activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of the kind and that their trading conditions prohibit this.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable reduction in the price of services.
In the meantime, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, classical service providers sought to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these very moments that regulatory bodies intervened, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then, even through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider to be followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are giving each other the whole case.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are useful to them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming out soon, perhaps the Czech mobile market will resume to move.
If one of the service providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it is difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of additional interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may no longer be making more expensive calls.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to four revisions of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the state anthem Where is my country? on the day of the Czech State.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solos, choir or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the anthem modification are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlavek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had already told Czech Radio that he deliberately selected young representative voice singers to sing solo variations, which are expressive and popular.
"From the very beginning, both of you and later, I tried to make a clear decision with the orchestra, to take care of the clarity and harmony of the text," he said.
The Czech state anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Country? was first performed at the Order Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán's Tyl Fidlovačka, complete with music by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously considered it their own.
And the first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What's the "new" anthem like?
Prague transport company delivers chip cards for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 Enter yourself in Prague Transport Company history as the date when the first passenger gets into subways, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line ticket.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30 days and 90 days as well as an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save their chip cards in the Transport Company's information centers and branches at Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
From yesterday, coupons can be purchased via the website of Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until hours in the afternoon.
Those who start using Internet trading can permanently forget the publishers of metro stations, where they have had to stand regularly for long lines for line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and the Opencard card is saved in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a counter with trained servers who help those interested in buying online and also saving their purchased coupons for their cards," said Martin Opatrný, a spokesperson for the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in self-service vending machines equipped in some lobbys.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, they remind us of ticket managers and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but they should be eighty by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon is automatically checked instead of the driver
The operation of vending machines starting tomorrow is easy to handle.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and a previously paid coupon is saved from itself.
From tomorrow electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital but also in its vicinity.
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which primarily residents of districts in central Bohemia travel to the capital.
"On trains classified as integrated transport in Prague, guides were provided with card readers to determine the zoning validity of coupons as well," explained Philip Drápal of the Ropid organization which compiled the Prague public transport schedule.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the driver's desk.
Therefore, when boarding, the driver should not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard at the location specified on the side of the counter.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, the easiest way to ask the driver to do so," he added Dráp.
Passengers who do not travel by buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon expires can go to the self-service vending machines that save coupons for cards again.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudetans wanted a referendum from the U.S.
The Sudeten Germans requested the annexation of Šumava to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from the letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Library of Sciences.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronate of the United States of America.
This is supposed to be the wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also evident from a letter preserved from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Library of Sciences.
Česky Krumlov Germans in the letter ask the U.S. President not to allow the "Sumava County" to be returned to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Treaty of Munich.
"The situation has been correctly understood and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops arrive in German territory by no means as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is in the letter, signed with the words "People who bear Šumava's fate in their hearts".
Since attaching to Czechoslovakia to the Sudeten Germans is said to give hope only to brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression, and slavery, in addition to knowing the Czech national character, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protectorate "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, he would judge this area to be a foreign country for us, which oppresses and upsets the minority, and would contribute almost nothing to the Allies' victory," states the letter.
The reason the authors could not sign is said to be fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
Therefore, if the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans of šumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the county of šumava on whether its inhabitants wish to become part of the US and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive with current knowledge of postwar history, some historians believe it properly depicts the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that they were being evacuated from the country, only a few of them acknowledged this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others trusted that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
Gustav Chalupa, Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice, proves this.
Chalupa served as the German of Budějovice in the navy in the Baltic Sea during the war.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and thrown into the Holštynsko detention camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They trusted that when they returned home, they could use the Czech language," said Chalupa.
Of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he said no one had counted that he would be displaced from the country on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
The Emotional Campaign Attacks Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history to ensure road safety.
The media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday could also be described.
Minister Aleš .ébíček's office hopes from this campaign to deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but will also appear on flyers.
You're supposed to scare the leaders away from speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to put their seat belts on before they leave.
He wants to address primarily the conscience of young drivers, motorcycle riders, pedestrians and, not least, professional leaders.
And what's in the commercials?
Emotional stories, primarily human stories.
That's what the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan says:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" on the license plate is in big letters.
And the blood pool has the word "you'll pay."
This should symbolize that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one's life.
The viewers are "scared" by the advertising spats until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let the drivers
"Drivers are subject to the system of 'pull, release'.
For them, 'let' is when, for example, they go through the red light, which saves them time.
"Pull" is a danger of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He says the driver's notice signs are less effective.
"If the hazard warning board is fitted, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," Kořa warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, president of the interim Israeli government, spoke of the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Plateau, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that was published daily by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means we have to return almost all of the (occupied) areas, if not all of them," Olmert told the daily newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these areas, but Palestinians need to transfer a similar percentage of Israeli territories, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and primarily wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross his feet as it happened to one of my best friends must give up some of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in reference to an attack on two July cities, during which some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution to the Temple Hill, sacred and historic places" in Old Town.
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he stressed.
Exodus from the Golan Plateau
Olmert also gave an opinion on the Israelis' withdrawal from the Golan Plateau, which he believes is an essential condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria solely based on the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know what they have to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they must give up regular support that they provide to Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Saint War) terrorism in Iraq," the Prime Minister specified.
Questions After an Accident: Are Flight attendants In Buses Unlawful?
The law doesn't know them. You can't walk in a long-distance bus.
Regarding the tragic bus accident of Student Agency, the question was raised in the vicinity of Padova, Italy, whether flight attendants and passengers could be in the bus on their way.
"If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the flight attendant's activities are in contradiction with the Transport Activity Act," says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22-year-old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus route.
Unfortunately for her, at that moment she was sitting next to the driver, the least secure place on the bus, although two additional seats were reserved for her.
The bus can crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the flight attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a role in whether the bus has a standing position according to the registration certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing spaces; which was confirmed by Radim Jančura, the company's director, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and at first passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this was withdrawn, and we concluded that passengers could go to the toilet during the journey if they had their own seats," he said.
The law doesn't know the flight attendant.
"There is no clear legal baling about the role of a flight attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds less clearly Hanzelka spokesman.
Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law handles the problem properly.
"It depends on whether there is a standing place on the bus registration.
And that's it," he says.
Buses may be urban by distinction where there are standing places and there are limited maximum speeds, and with standing places and permitted higher speeds between cities, as well as long-distance seats with safety belts without standing places and with maximum permitted speed.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP’s transport safety expert, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
"In continuing progress there is not much danger, we can compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
It's not even certain when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"If, however, the bus suddenly braked, of course, its physical laws apply.
Just like in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be solved by the carrier by internal rules," he says and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura ready to terminate services
Student Agency offers cabin crew services as the sole bus carrier.
It employs 200 flight attendants.
The director doesn't consider their occupation a risk after the accident.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that the flight attendants' occupation is risky, I will terminate it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers on board.
This would also be cost savings," he says.
In his vehicles, the lack of flight attendants was justified with safety interests by Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
"We have no flight attendants, we have opposed this from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some kind of fatal injury," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An Incredible Tragedy Happened
A young flight attendant from Plzeň, who had worked for the company for two years, died during a regular flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop lane without using a direction indicator and blocked the bus's path.
The bus driver suddenly tried to escape by maneuvering, but the right front of the bus hit him.
That two reserved places for the rest of the flight attendants would have been sold, Jančura refuses.
"These places in long-distance flights cannot be booked, blocked".
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By indemnifying the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court's judgment, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Amendment to the law?
In the distant future
Clarification of the movements of flight attendants on board the bus could be reported by the amendment of the law, which has been being worked for more than a year by the thirty-man expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, the group did not get any concrete results.
The buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the highway and mobile use while driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka by saying that the control of bus safety falls within the competence of police and labour offices.
Düsseldorf hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB's board to the bank's staff does not lack big words.
The merger between the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create "the central capital market organization of the savings bank financial group", says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board wishing to demonstrate its capacity to act in difficult times.
After all, the uncertain bank of WestLB remains under great pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia provincial government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution was tight.
However, the relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, famous for its investment funds for savings banks customers, has been a topic of contact for some time now - also in Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, at the time of the presentation of the half-yearly data, informed that the merger between the bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a provincial bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not make sense.
Despite this, Deka's board of directors, one half of which is representatives of the Landesbanks and the other half of the savings bank associations, tasked the board to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
In doing so, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be considered.
However, the negotiations - they claim to be financial circles - have only just begun.
With its 3,000 employees, Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first to come up with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this triple alliance did not turn out to be anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessian provincial government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
Afterwards, the other two banks failed to find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead transferred to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, over and over again the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised.
However, most recently Günther Merl, board chairman of Helaba, spoke out against plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, the need to approach the various banks in the public sector is ripe for recognition.
Now, following the provincial assembly elections in Bavaria, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected to be the first to be connected.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it may slowly run out of potential partners.
South Germany could only be a younger partner, even though it has so far survived the financial crisis significantly better than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
And fusion with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen with 85% business share in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
NordLB will remain for lack of better.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Bank and Fat Association had not yet answered the decisive question about what business model to ensure the future of provincial banks.
Finally, it is conceivable to dismember WestLB, which is naturally not desired there.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also discusses that they are definitely seeking a "full solution".
How this is compatible with the union of individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's the third or fourth time.
Now Elena is here as his girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them, the Kaiser-brand five-litre barrel, is next to a man with a beard with a strong build and asserts to some 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest how deep sounds he can draw out of his throat.
Elena first taps Luca's face, then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, four buses depart from the bus parking lot near Puorta Nuova Station at 23.4 p.m. "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" with a travel destination, arrival expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, and in the fourth only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans had already sung alongside their flag, already beginning celebration during the night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears the long, artificial fur coat and wide, silvery stem glasses.
He's been driving me to Oktoberfest for five years. He's only organized three trips this year.
At night there, during the day at Oktoberfest, at 2.30 p.m. home.
Accommodation would be a waste of money, Marco says.
The trip costs EUR 75, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and guided tour in German - Marco graduated from a German language course in Frankfurt.
And now the buses are throwing themselves into the night on the highway towards Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, and the passengers will be asleep.
All right, you're gonna need your strength.
They take a rest in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses on Highway 8 take a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses coming from across Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding one final briefing, presenting the plan of war.
First, put on your yellow hats.
On the left side of this, the inscription "Oktoberfest" in fracture letters reads, next to it is Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the gates of the beer tent open, run," Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the places in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, for we get stuck, and not to the same benches all the yellow hats sit, but scatter in the tent!"
The one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards you've behaved well.
As soon as you leave your posts, they will take over!"
Third, "Tonight at 10:30 sharp, be back here again." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men ties yellow caps on trees, boards, and even an election poster for one of the great Bavarian people's parties.
We need to be prepared to retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no precise figures; there are 50,000 people talking about crossing the Alps breaking into the beer tents, with ten percent of all visitors to the weekend reportedly arriving from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, and Italian volunteers assist the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics with about 200 medical supplies the Italians take the first place, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British who were stuck to the lowest degree of podium (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is particularly popular among Italians.
Sleepless Nights for the Creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, emphasized Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word "relatively" and even said that the German banking sector was not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The real estate finance company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) in Munich, recorded on Dax, received a billion-dollar loan from the consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that loan subsidies amounted to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the portion used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
The backdrop is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa, who made state funding, lent money to long-term projects and refinanced them to an extremely short maturity - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of equity also declined moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net proceeds from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, with revenues from crediting claims and specific securities and the liquidation of provisions in the credit business falling by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex-post clearing costs for the conversion of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulation and the business for the group companies, was the revenue deficit of around 16% relatively modest.
The former state financier speculated first with corporate real estate loans following privatization in 1990, which were later segregated at Aeral Bank.
Since classical state funding could be made little, Depfa invested more heavily in infrastructure projects, as well as in joint projects between private investors and the State (private-public partnership, PPP), and expanded its activities internationally.
The value of subsidiaries should now be described by Hypo Real Estate as having a "substantial impact" on the group's profit and loss account, they said quite generally.
In fact, there was no dividend payment.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier since the takeover of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has dried up as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Depfa's loan portfolio, around EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate announcement, the group's need for funding is covered for a period of time with credit, and the company is protected "from the influence of international financial markets that are currently highly inoperable."
Other sources say that, thanks to the funds, refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate group did not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) see that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now ensured.
This gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and incomprehensibleness of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that there is no need to make full use of funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the late-night news on Saturday said the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, even temporarily saving it could not calm the moods.
The share price fell by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, bond rates are quite good for themselves.
While the first-place debt hardly changes, the exchange rates of the bonds that were ordered back fell significantly.
In particular, the crisis concerns the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, as far as possible, the maturity beyond 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds had previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value integrity must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system in the wake of the escalation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost housed the crisis by taking over Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the scheme, they can rely on the payment of benefits by deadline.
Or something will happen that almost no one at the moment dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports on partial nationalisation, the probability bordering on certainty has now merely become a legitimate hope.
For long-term creditors, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to part with their investment.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on exchange rate gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Inside Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German chick is totally "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the Manga - in the new exchange student blog, she tells about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was scared on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I wasn't lost.
The beginning of teaching in Tachibana does not seem to be taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to cram in from eight o'clock until a brief conversation with the teacher, "home room" begins at 8:40.
But before school started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've worn an old skirt by my landlady, a blouse, blue knee tights, and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I stood before the caterer and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I had been learning the language for several years.
All 31 girls were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kavaí."
I knew that from my manga.
This belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, sweet."
Then I swerved right into my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide, feeling honored that the exchange student had been seated next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they ran me by the book.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my belly - and it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone unwrapped their inlets.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German lunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, cucumbers and algae salads, fruit and some kind of tofu-wrapped meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely novel taste.
In fact, everything is delicious.
Yeah, well, maybe except for the salty plum stew, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, the inn isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl presents a boy with her own handmade bento, which she especially puts together artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe that here.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm simply charmed."
After all, I've wanted to read manga for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture described in them, I started learning Japanese at some point.
So it was very clear to me that I had to come here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are very precious here.
Japan is a country of the latest techniques and trends on the one hand - and it is strict, disciplined and traditional on the other.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats have feelings, too.
A rat or a moth escapes in the event of danger.
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Animals also have emotions.
But how can they examine whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge", famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE, in one of its series, is looking at the answers to the question "What Do You Think Is Real, Without Proof?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we examine other species and dissect questions of perception or consciousness in general, we arrive in difficult terrain as hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: He pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar manner, from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to those of animals.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and enforcement/control functions).
This wide area is higher in humans than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are or, in the case of planning and decision ability, it is justified to assume that one is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Because a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals may be excluded.
However, even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness can be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my discussion concerns the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The consciousness processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, during the assumption also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural contexts of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: Both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What follows from this regarding emotions?
I'm leading this back to the fact that an emotional system, like that of fear, is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear", therefore, is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies a work memory.
Thus examined, emotions are closely linked to areas of the cerebral cortex that are typical of primates and especially humans.
Complemented with language, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states to describe them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions stem from the simpler activities of the cortex and brain stem body perception areas, as is Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overarching emotions of species.
In theory, I cannot deny that, but I find it unproven.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to also feel so in both cases: How could rats and humans be checked for the same feeling when they behave similarly?
A cockroach escapes in the event of danger, does he also feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not yet proof of the same experience.
Although neural fragmentation continues to help: rats and humans have a similar brain stem, but cockroaches do not have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for the emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans: how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but even cockroaches, who knows, have feelings.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I research the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is expected at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't research emotion, because I don't know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted approach to someone else, but I'd rather go ahead than keep bumping into a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vaszjunik of Ukraine said that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees confidence in Ukraine in UEFA's decision in Bordeaux and evidence that they believe that Ukraine, together with Poland, is capable of organising the European Championship," Vaszjunik said.
"This, however, does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is much to do in both countries."
With regard to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are lagging behind.
The number of EB stadiums may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work at peak speed now," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they decided to take an even more radical step.
The National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance following numerous scandals, which was replaced by independent Supervisory Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that PZPN cannot operate according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish news agency PAP.
"In letters, we assured Michel Platini, president of UEFA, that this would not adversely affect preparations for the 2012 EB."
Only in the past season, several first league teams had to be classified in the lower class due to manipulation, and eventually the leaguestart had to be postponed.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, talk about her private life in the interview, and now she's having trouble with her ex-husband, and Hollywood star Ryan classified her former husband, Dennis Quaide, as an adulterer.
The one who pushes - and fights back
Late Roses War at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-families: The two Hollywood actors fight each other ugly fight seven years after their divorce - in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with American magazine InStyle, said for the first time last week about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
Plus, she only found out after the divorce how many women Dennis cheated on her.
The spiritual striptease took place due to Ryan's press work on his new film "The Women", which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid definitely responded to his cry for disloyal husband: "It's terrible," said the 54-year-old actor to the daily newspaper "New York Daily News," "that Meg repeats and spends the story of our relationship boringly."
In addition, it is "unfortunate" that 16-year-old common boys, Jack, are repeatedly "publicly reminded of the much pain and change that divorce causes for a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid married again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following sidecut: "My life will continue anyway.
I can be happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in order."
Flight tickets and hotel room prices are decreasing
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Prices of flights and hotel rooms have again become more favourable - so you can summarize the results of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price drop in the second quarter after the price increase in the first quarter.
After prices in the hotel market rose for years, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities under investigation compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6 percent lower in the period from April to June than in the previous year.
This trend was shown most clearly in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30–37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which led to "the fleeting travel mood of American tourists".
The decrease in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
There was also an increasing change in the prices of air tickets in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-term flights with high fuel demand have increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, prices for tourist-class airline tickets decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, however, prices in business and first class showed only a much more moderate change.
Prices in Germany have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 19.9 percent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
The price of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reason for the price decline lies in the moderating economic growth, the company claims.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the aviation road market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe is increasing the pressure exerted by the competitive situation.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines are cancelling their loss-making flights, and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, it affects 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1–0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV topped the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find the working team.
Kristoffer Klein Zoom Deep Flight for National Team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only came into play late and his lift bounced back from the goalpost.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the Hamburg arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat in their seats again.
Rieger was HSV's physical therapist for nearly three decades, enjoying more authority than some former players.
Thus, his request was heard at the competent place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and presented his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His orders could have been similar: Give me the second goal!
The command has not been executed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also "imagined" the matter more loosely.
The score of 1: 0 (1: 0) was due to the header of Mladen Petric of Hamburg (11); and the circumstance that the very weak Gladbachians were unable to inflict pain on the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 this Monday.
Viewers celebrated themselves as early as Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table appearing on the projector, which displayed their team as the top of the championship's class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly thanks to its late-committed compositions - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern - but not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and trickery," demanded Jol.
After the vote on
Wall Street is full of fear.
The first news of the rescue package's failure caused the Dow Jones to temporarily fall 700 points.
This was the biggest score loss in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow somewhat strengthened.
At 2:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer was down 5 percent and stood at 10.579 points.
Nasdaq, a technology paper dealer, fell to 1548 points with more than seven percent minus.
Dow's biggest loser at this moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with 12 percent.
No paper has been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs bank's stock fell nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier, the bank bought a stake in Warren Buffett, a major investor.
Under the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the acquisition of so-called dubious mortgage papers.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid simultaneously but gradually.
In return, the State would receive vouchers for the share option of financial institutions, which would be effective if the exchange rates were to be properly developed, reducing the burden on the state budget.
European and American and stock prices in running order
Billionaire aid to European and American banks does not dispel investors' doubts.
The German major bank Hypo Real Estate's stock price is falling and captures Dax.
The U.S. Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the state-designed rescue of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German share index (Dax) deep into the negative.
Despite a rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, the value of the Munich real estate funder's stock fell to a quarter, with Commerzbank weakening by over 20 percent.
Dax sank below the psychologically important 6,000 points limit and recorded 5839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets have fallen to their knees worldwide.
In New York City, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, or 3.3 percent, to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European stock markets also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2 percent weakening, with CAC 40 losing 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index sank 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 points after initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped back 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator failed 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595.75.
On the Mdax market, Arcandor’s shares weakened following the announcement of the capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheimer recorded 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist group also stated that Thomas Cook shares would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing uncertainty among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be entirely correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew into space for nearly 18 years.
Due to soon-frozen fuel lines, it is threatened with freezing death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational swinging pit of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational space of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses Sun probe, also used this physical trick.
However, what amazes researchers for years has been: Flying objects do not behave fully as they might be expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, abnormalities occur in speed.
Probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was dubbed swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which perceives the mass attraction of matter as a curvature of space.
American physicist Stephen Adler, of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly, which may even be found all the way near Earth," says Adler.
The existence of dark matter was only known to space scientists ten years ago.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be seen to have an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or repel any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists calculate that a good one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists Kidnapped in Egypt Released
After spending ten days in the captivity of their abductors, tourists who were taken away in Egypt are free again, confirmed the Italian foreign minister.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostage takers are said to have been killed.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are ongoing.
Over and over again, Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists carried away in the Sahara are free.
Consistently, this was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija's Arab TV station, and Italian media.
According to reports from the Italian Sky TG 24 television station, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our compatriots and other hostages have been freed.
We are currently investigating their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
It continues to obscure the reasons for the shooting before the release of hostages: An Egyptian security official said the hostage takers had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem has been resolved.
They accepted the ransom," said the official.
"The trial was about taking hostages" when a sudden "surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of €6 million from Germany; the money was to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "al-Masri al-Jom" reported, citing a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages is protracted because the kidnappers are concerned for their own safety.
According to the report, hostage takers release female hostages following payment of the ransom.
The men are being held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"Suicide led to" stepdad violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been bullying her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, living in the village of Stithians in Cornwall County, spent 6 years in prison after confessing to an attempt at eight counts of rape disclosure.
The Truro criminal court found out that he had regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
At the trial, it was said that Randle committed suicide at the age of 34, at his home in the Mutley district of Plymouth City, on April 1, 2007.
When he lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied him up and blindfolded him before intercourse while his mother was working in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his residence again.
Stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court hearing, it was revealed that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering with the National Trust Monument Conservation Organization, was being chased by horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, according to her friends, "emotional dead" and "resigned life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
Probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a run-in with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter saying, "I always tied him up and blindfolded him.
I wasn't sexually harassing her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
However, the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have been brought to justice."
The judge added, "I draw attention to how Stephanie's parents said the crime you committed had affected your daughter over the years.
If this hadn't happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost important data has been charged
According to BBC intelligence, a government official who has forgotten top secret documents on a train in June is charged with violating an official's secret of office.
The man was on an expert mission from the Ministry of Defence when he left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were turned over to the police.
This is the mildest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional perpetration.
According to Frank Gardner, a correspondent for the BBC Department of Defense, the move surprised many at Whitehall.
"They thought the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the incident as an internal matter," he said.
The employee who cannot be named is charged under point 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about preserving information.
The state prosecutor's office suggested that the official be prosecuted by the Metropolitan Police for the man's work on the Unified Intelligence Committee of a rather sensitive nature.
The documents he lost included secret surveys related to Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was notified of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an unknown location.
Housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
Britain's housing cooperatives can expect an account worth more than £80 million after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent £14 billion protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to the president of the Housing Cooperatives Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, it is "enrageful" that companies and their members have to pay.
The £14 billion loan will eventually be reimbursed after the repayment of the mortgages of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing-building cooperatives were also one of them.
It is aggravating that the institutions which have already acted carefully ... now have to pay the accounts of those institutions which have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company has to pay the amount of deposit it has in its possession. Companies share 18% of the cost among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of credit will reach £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to set aside £81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the housing companies union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is outrageous that institutions that have acted cautiously during the boom of the housing market must pay the bills of much less cautious institutions."
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"We need to look at this matter in every way over the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from a substantial amount of bills," added Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a full year's interest rate will be paid, which could be twice the current interest rate.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organisations, without shareholders, eventually members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest rates on their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
Jersey dairy company announced it would increase wholesale prices of milk by an additional fivepence per litre as of Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the twopence increase in February and following a survey carried out by an advisory company.
Resellers decide whether to pass on the price increase to consumers themselves.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed for the last time in 2002.
The request by former Member of Parliament for Bangladesh to defend himself at large has been rejected.
The Bangladesh court rejected a request for protection on parole from former MP Sheikh Hasina, which means he could be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court denied him protection on parole in connection with the charge of extorting 50 million takas ($729,700) from a businessman during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of countless allegations of corruption against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent Khaleda Zia was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, however her party, Awami League, demands that the country's army-backed interim government give her full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was paroled to go abroad for treatment, parole conditions do not make it clear whether he can preserve his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the appeals court's decision.
"The court of appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail by saying that it was not necessary, since she had already been temporarily set free and is undergoing foreign treatment," we learned from attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against appeal court ruling".
His lawyers argue that he needs protection at large so that he can return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took over, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the UN, almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan were left out of the recently organized polio vaccination programme due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a United Nations spokesperson, all this was done despite the Taliban's promise that they would not attack or impede the work of thousands of vaccination personnel.
BSkyB's appeal for ITV has been rejected
BskyB's appeal against the Competition Committee's decision to reduce its interest in rival TV station ITV was rejected.
The Court of Competition Appeals ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee found that BSkyB's share hampered competition and gave the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB purchased its stake in 2006 and thereby effectively prevented the NTL - which has since been renamed Virgin Media - from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office reported that BSkyB's share of ITV would threaten ITV's independence, encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation.
Virgin's director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom supervision all opposed the acquisition.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV's participation was pointless and disproportionate reparation - especially given that BSkyB said it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Another investigation into the U.S. Attorneys' case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 discharge of nine U.S. Attorneys.
The move followed that the account of the case by the Chief Justice of the Judiciary Department criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators, and former Supreme Attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the U.S. Attorneys were dismissed for political consideration.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials who have been heard during the investigation have tried to prevent justice by lying.
"The serious charges relating to possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been cleared," said Superintendent Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who has the power to require witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys from his post by the U.S. Judicial Wallet in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that the prosecutors were dismissed due to their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed district attorneys received no worse assessment than many of their other colleagues, which led many to conclude that political considerations were behind the dismissals.
Some prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in investigating allegations of election fraud against Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys on behalf of the government are conducting investigations and court cases.
They can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
The then head of the justice portfolio, Supreme Attorney Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks over discharges and eventually resigned.
Many other officers of the judicial wallet also submitted their resignations.
In his report, the superintendent greatly criticized Gonzales' role in the case. He said the supreme prosecutor was "primarily responsible" for dismissals, his "resigned" role as a leader, and "remarkably withdrawn himself" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former assistant to Bush Sr., are criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposza receives recognition
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition at the Q Awards Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive her special gold-grade award at the London ceremony next week, said she considers it an honor.
The song, nine minutes, fifty-five seconds in length, was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 audience success harvest album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, placing on the candidate list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like this."
The song obtained by Jim Steinman required a very large voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was present on the charts for almost nine years and after that more than 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf, actually known as Marvin Lee Aday, has recently been suffering from health problems. Among other things, in 2003, he underwent surgery due to his heart rhythm disorder after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute laryngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
An unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, tours and other side roads, some of them famous, others merely performing practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long - lived local residents would find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and heads north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long and is much more like a dusty alley than a main transportation route.
There are no street signs.
Technically, it can't be found on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, the Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to re-envelop Extra Place and ensure that the shops and boutiques of the new buildings can be accessed in a cleaner way.
Admirers of the street include neighbors long lived here who were caught in the truncated street by the fact that it was the only remnant of the neighborhood's past prior to renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the street owner, the city's building conservation and development department, to insist.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality's land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the city's management and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, reported Susan Stetzer, district leader of municipal body No. 3.
"There are very few areas in the city's possession now, and we want Extra Place to remain the city's," he said.
"There may be proposals for refurbishment and treatment that can be made by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to re-envelop the small street and provide seats, some of which would be used by a cafe, to which the builder is expected to lease an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month's session.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, it does not insist on having it.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this rundown alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Building Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for developing buildings and not managing them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor the Bowery, Extra Place is of little historical significance.
Some say he was named "the land of no one" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The punk-rock monument, which closed in 2006, CBGB's rear exit, opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most notable of being photographed there on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great venue," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothing, pieces of barrels and posters, as well as leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about how the middle class took possession of East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that remains virtually unchanged and which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Vanishing New York" ("Book of Deaths: Bitter Nostalgia looking at the Process of Extinction of the City"), posted on his blog some of the story about Extra Place that appeared in the section "City Rumor" in the weekly "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote, "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end that is dark even during the day, bounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and spaletted windows, and where the wind carries week-long newspapers in the canals."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street at the end of the street, by the back door that used to lead to CBGB, and now belongs to a higher priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty 0.75-litre beer bottle lying next to a discarded fresh pile of newspaper.
Some passersby said they rarely remember Extra Place, but they think it could use a renovation.
Fields said that he thought some people underestimate his attractiveness in the current state of the street.
"I've spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' opinions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California studies at the Institute for Public Policy Research in the Pacific and senior director of education research, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why Middle Class Needs School Choice".
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama's campaign, "fro-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and that's true.
To overcome such performance differences, Obama's educational plan explicitly supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
However, for Obama, the question of whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, overcomes his interest in overcoming large performance differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, for example, contract elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the school's students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
Nevertheless, 100% of fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
It is equally impressive that 93% of fourth graders performed excellently in the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills, and rejection of objections.
Besides, and that's what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is the "full immersion" of English students into the linguistic environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other objects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said, "we have had a sweeping success in that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn't notice who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months before."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama put schools such as Sixth Street Prep in front of other schools with a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English students as examples to follow?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear, however, due to the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and as it itself consistently advocates bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently spoke underestimatingly about the issue when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "exclusive Englishness" of the legislature.
Instead, he said, "they should make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between results, he should seriously study models that work instead of looking down on them and ignoring them.
Oil prices fell sharply due to renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell steeply due to concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets would not be able to revive the economy.
The stocks of crude oil fell by seven percent to $99.80 in the morning at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have dropped by over $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity exchanges have been shaken by the Wall Street financial turmoil, and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before falling again under the influence of immeasurable uncertainty on financial markets.
On Monday, anxiety again overwhelmed investors even after Congress leaders announced that they had reached an agreement over the weekend regarding the economic rescue operation, which is the largest in history.
The news was clouded by concerns that the financial crisis would not be over for a long time.
As the latest event of the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire Wachovia Corporation's banking business, announced Monday by the government.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of desperate weekend talks "it seems that the rescue operation failed to revive the stock market trading mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that the demand for goods, such as oil, will also be reduced.
"The future of the market for ordinary shares, interest rates and currency rates has become uncertain worldwide," wrote an analyst from Deutsche Bank to investors.
"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the 'outbreak'".
The biggest issue for the commodity exchange is the extent to which the "disease" of the U.S. is infecting the whole world, especially with regard to China."
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts cut off their expectations for next year, reducing their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
With the feat of the second quarter, the team set their record
After spending more time in the Jets jersey than anyone else in the past more than eight seasons, Shaun Ellis, who played in defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the sloth game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals came into full alignment with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, a perfect forerunner for an afternoon during which their evolving collaborations significantly improved.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks in a row fell 10 seconds before the half ended.
"I wasn't sorry for the trouble," Favre said about all of his passes to Coles.
"Pokoli is a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, who played in cornerback position, caught a bad pitch and threw it back 32 yards, which was a touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety player, reached into another pass and scored the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing move in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets scored, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34–0 result.
This was the best result the Jets have ever achieved within a quarter.
When the Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter, the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets scoring any - Mangini said, "I have to tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him the best mid- and long-distance runner ever to have lived when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run the 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on a comfortably flat course in 2:03:59 time, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on his 2:04:26 previous result, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record of his career in so many areas that he won a World Championship in almost all terms from 1500 metres to the marathon, or a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - which in retrospect may have proved excessive caution - that air pollution would further exacerbate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather, initially at 9 °C and in the end at 13 °C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since runners not previously running on the marathon, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Tergat of Kenya turned to longer distances, the marathon record has declined by more than two minutes in the last decade since Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin with a 2:06:05 result in 1998.
After the win on Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago his two legs had cramped and could not train for two weeks.
It is obvious that during the forced rest, he refreshed himself and did not rust.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
He received some reviews - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - that he uses too many aids during his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his pace runners as running on track, and placing world records before the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04 with four Kenyan pace runners on Sunday.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the pace runners were exhausted.
Shortly over 4.8 kilometers ahead of the target, Gebrselassie passed Kwambai with a final sprint, who finished second with 2:05:36, improving his personal best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, finished a notable year with her seventh fastest win of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by the British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won a surprise at the London marathon with a 2:24:14 result.
He was unable to attend the Beijing Olympics due to his alleged back injury, however he quickly healed and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes. It was the third marathon long-distance run he attended.
He won the race with a clever calculation: he first allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership and then came after them after running about 30 km.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31 while Kenyan Helena Kiprop came third with a result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and ordeal of black people
In the experience park in Greater Orlando - a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and powerful - a quiet small town hides where the pride and complications of African-American life experience have been born.
Eatonville, the first purely black town to integrate into the country and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is now not as simple as she described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, lots of guajavas and two schools, without prison."
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival. The Eatonville celebration series is held in honor of Harlem Renaissance's most famous female writer Hurston.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction - which is also included in the Florida guidebook published by the Project of Federal Writers of the Crisis Age - is distinct from his surroundings.
Just as independent, dignified and shut-in as it was in the 1930s, when according to a writing by Hurston, Florida, urban blacks often refused to share their real thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open exchange of views on the race issue, many here are distrustful of outsiders' glances.
"We are very careful how our story is told," reported 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to tell it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historic model of black standing, while at the same time it is a community of almost 2,400 people where poverty indicators reach double the national average.
It is partly a literary node, and partly an example of a sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (everyone here calls Hurston).
In books written in the sincere, strong dialect - like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
Five sections of the Florida guidebook have transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17, which leads from the long forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, like drum roll, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor Joe Clarke's business and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school, with a white trim on a brown background, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller tends, although he can barely read and write."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn was "selling all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodations."
Thus, in a few hundred words Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really didn't appeal to everyone.
"Zora told the things as they were," reported 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the slippery songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Hurston is still remembered here as the lively eccentric who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, aged 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a rumbling Chevrolet, smoking, and long trousers to a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
Most people were enchanted, Franklin said, but many were foresaid.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added swinging in his chair, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer reissued.
It seemed to have been forgotten by Eatonville along with most of the world.
Although he was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he had previously lived.
There were no significant commemorations or large, public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the book Hurston biography published in 2003, "In the Rainbow".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the western border of the city by Interstate 4 highway connecting the states.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, fighting over racial blending gave the community a taste of hatred.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at people on the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a letter to "The Orlando Sentinel" in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court requiring violent integration. He said of the resolution "Brown v. Board of Education": "it offends me more than respects my race."
Today residents say that although the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, it weakened the unity of the Eatonville people and undermined the confidence of young people.
"The black children are accustomed to being hugged - I remember this - man hugged his teacher both in the morning and in the evening" reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the nonprofit organization "Let's Guard the Community of Meg Eatonville".
"This lasted until students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights helped the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who rose above prejudices, as she did, with such optimistic self-confidence and lines as: "How can anyone deprive himself of the enjoyment of my company!
This is incomprehensible to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker wandered off to Hurston's unmarked grave and began struggling to return her reputation.
Five years later, a recognized Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the shelves of bookstores, which brought him back to being one of America's role models.
The road construction project would have started just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was re-focused on attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the county would ruin with its main road.
Thousands of fans arrived for the opening event two years later, and many have since returned to the ceremony every January.
Several years later, the county abandoned its road construction proposal.
"Because of five lanes on the main road, the community has revived, turned to full speed, which means true civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd put it simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the city's image of itself.
There was an increasing number of people living outside the city, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began attending church here in 1993, and the locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical list in 1998.
The new single-storey library (named naturally after Hurston) was opened in 2006, on re-enveloped and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remained Florida's cuckoo egg: it's not quite ten km from the center of Orlando only, but sometimes one feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; it's as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of residents are black.)
They still welcome with caution the outsiders who arrive here in search of Eatonville's story, what he has to say.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their distinct community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew wider, the pride of the hometown grew.
In particular, youths increasingly view Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, along with his problems and everything, neither better nor worse, as proud, creative, industrious, foolish, and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
An honest civic attachment is heard from the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to take a job with the local government or the police, which he believes are in need of help.
And it seems the younger ones have also learned to characterize Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here think this town is nothing compared to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after worship on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know their history, it's a very nice city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If tourists didn't care about newsstand booths and huge television projectors in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture fund managers who hold New York in power have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers still rattle their metal tea trucks through the sidewalks, carrying trays filled with muffins for morning meetings.
There are still Spanish-speaking men shuffling among the blockhouses, carrying as human mules fifty or so ironed shirts hanging on a yoke-like loop across their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting in line for their breakfast sweet pastries at food trucks on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I purposely planned to take care of things during the afternoon's quiet in the local branch of my bank JP Morgan Chase, I had about 20 people in line.
Not at the window of the bank teller, where money can be picked up or paid in, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me - I later learned from Starr, the "ordered" banker - lined up with the same intention as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
Money was taken out from savings banks (which are such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and are said to treat their clients as family members.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have been quietly destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, has been placed under bankruptcy care, and when New Yorkers left for home by the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, sought out a bank rescue buyer with a savings of $440 billion.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, the bank that makes the most capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese store on her phone spoke of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the janitor in uniform on the block of my apartment in his 50s, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my food shipment like we used to.
He said to me after I was at the bank, "I invested all my savings in money market assets.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim tombs were desecrated while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008 in which the organization "Cityers Against the Expansion of Islam" was introduced.
They marched with emulating signs of traffic signs depicting mosques drawn through a red line.
Police say far-right extremists are responsible for desecrating Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which occurred on the same weekend that far-right parties significantly advanced in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traunian cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David's star, on some graves, but investigators said this was only trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow associated with elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shaken" at the hearing of the tomb desecration, which occurred shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience inquiry following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance is tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for the Future of the Freedom Party and the Alliance Austria, a highly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were branded xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party, who has won more than 18% of the vote, has also expressed his disapproval of the campaign against headscarfs and burkas, as well as of foods alleged to be associated with Islam.
At the party's final Grand Assembly in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood", which helps prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
According to polls and analyses conducted immediately after the elections that brought about the victory of the far-right, the change was due to the largely young voting base who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from travelling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child rape, was barred from his trip to France and Spain by the court.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after he informed the authorities controlling him of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
Kent Police obtained a ban on travel by Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of convictions for child rape against Glitter.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the trial of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning lawyers.
A court spokesperson said, "Thursday, September 25, Kent Police filed a request with Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd's planned journey to France and Spain by March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person".
The 64-year-old Glitter notified the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because of the obligation to do so under the law applicable to those in the register of sex offenders.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If he does not notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to five years imprisonment.
Kent Police said they did not want to talk about his individual cases within Glitter County and his possible whereabouts.
We learned from a spokesperson for Kent Police: "The Kent Police are doing everything they can to protect children inside the country and abroad.
"We believe it is easier to control someone if they do not leave the UK, because we have a comprehensive system here so that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent Police Department is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons in the register of sex offenders and those living in the county in order to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnam prison for raping a 10 and an 11-year-old girl.
Following his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
He was not allowed to pass the passport test by the landscape authorities, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the landscape police and immigration office insisted he return to Britain.
He eventually arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the West London, uxbridge court as he was admitted to the register of sex offenders under a court order, as requested by Scotland Yard.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for possession of photographs of child rape in 1999.
According to a source at the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, took comfort and was pleased that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not taking photos on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal side" Photographer Günther Bauer
No set, no ruffles, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco from near the body, without the excitement of performing: to get to know the ordinary faces of dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments away from the audience, when we can watch a personal move, grasp the depth of a caught look, or marvel at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of the artist who is not about to perform on stage.
In the German photo series Flamenco-people, Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less-known ordinary side of masters.
Through the photos, the flamenco presents its specific iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the month of Flamenco Photography, "reflects the increasing international importance of flamenco day by day," the creator believes, adding that Flamenco-people "could be anyone, as the observer realizes that these images do not depict artists in a typical way.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and enslave the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to use the camera to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With momentum from the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on his long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
These portraits quote classical photography thanks to the camera and the choice of subject.
However, the application of various stylistic tools breaks with traditional visual representation and suggests modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always fascinating."
It's not the dance, it's not the singing or the music itself, it's the artist's personality and character that charms the audience.
In recent days, the leading motif of works that can be seen in the El Photomata gallery is the search for an encounter with its essence, the artistic sewing, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and visualization.
Known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are hallmarked by the names of this photo collection featuring nearly sixty artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, about which an album covering portraits presented at the exhibition will soon be released.
Bauer's passion for portraits spurred him to repeat the idea two years ago with the series "Portraits of Veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people differs slightly from this, the photographer adds: "I really like taking pictures of people, getting to know them and entering their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you meet people you don't even know sometimes, or you just take a few minutes to shoot.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
A selection of contemporary flamenco portraits, titled Flamenco-people, can be seen at the El Photomata Gallery, located at the calle de la Mata 20 parallel to Alameda de Hércules until October 16.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he's working on is "ready to be reckless"
The site and plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on writing his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in Congo for twenty years and also went through Amazonia.
A writer who is also a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature at the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday admitted that his current work is "ready-to-do recklessness" and "all signs indicate that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope I'll get to the bottom of it at some point," he concluded his presentation at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in the city of Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the festival of literature, and he fulfilled the hopes he had for it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". Her performance filled the Juan Bravo theatre.
After the toast of Félix Romeo, he was quickly greeted by a devoted audience. For the public, the watch was quickly blown away, during which the Peruvian writer told with amazing memory and a great deal of humor how his writing profession evolved from the special adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live; how he bridges the lack of inspiration through disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing profession, and what his stories are based on.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but added: "I don't think literature is mere entertainment or a yew-flower-life experience", as it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to yield to the temptation of ease and to be held responsible for their vocation.
Due to the bad weather, the Pozoblanco farewell is shorter, and the bullfights on horseback are cancelled.
The riding bullfight traditionally held as the closing chord for the Pozoblanco holidays was cancelled from the show yesterday morning after future horse bullfighters found the arena's ground unfit for the fight.
As a result, the committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, that the bullfight would be cancelled.
Weather adversities thoroughly torn up the series of celebrations, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was missed due to rain.
Future protagonists José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista would have fought bulls from Castilblanco.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, taking home three ears as a trophy. After the sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was carried around shoulder to shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante gained a number of accolades and an ear as a trophy through his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than his own performance.
After this, however, El Juli followed, who had little to contribute to aggravating the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience managed to get out of control.
In general, a van carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape road inspection
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Territorial Police are carrying out traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiño, Álava.
The authorities are stopping a van with two passengers in it, and the passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was not noticeable at the same time.
Investigators pursued passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A. A. J., said the Basque government's Home Affairs Department.
The man captured is charged with drug trafficking and document tampering.
The incident occurred in the administrative area of Armiñón, where traffic control was carried out by employees of the Álava Traffic Surveillance on the N-1 highway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the checkpoint.
Investigators pursued him, and then the vehicle stopped a few miles away on the stop lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after inspecting the Iveco Daily branded van, seized its shipment of 2178 kilograms of hashish.
Hashish bales filling the rear of the vehicle were transported by police agencies to conduct a more thorough investigation and measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was shown that the vehicle's false registration plate did not match the data contained in the van's papers, so the arrested was also prosecuted for authentic instrument falsification.
The Basque Regional Police are continuing the investigation, which aims to arrest the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, has fled the highway and, on the other hand, to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A. A. J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and judicial measures began within a few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of medication.
Actress Heather Locklear, a popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by police in Santa Barbara, California over the weekend because she was driving under the influence of medication.
According to one eyewitness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, said People magazine, a spokesperson for traffic control in California.
According to the eyewitness, at around 16.30 a.m., Locklear "pulled the gas to the floor, crying the engine, trying to leave the parking lot both forward and backwards, and repeatedly passed through his sunglasses in reverse."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also alerted the police because he was "worried about Locklear's life".
When the police arrived, the actress was in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
"He seemed distracted," so patrols took him for drug and alcohol testing at a specialized center.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was ruled out almost immediately. The spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of officers, she was thought to have been under the influence of Locklear medicine.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was transferred to the local prison around 19 o'clock, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago, where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the IU Secretary General and United Left Representative, stated today that the regional Federation of the Corps will make a decision in the case of former Seville Municipality Youth and Sports Counsel Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of misusing his position to confer benefits on his family members.
"In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter certainly falls within the competence of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the president of the IU stressed that "transparency" should be borne in mind when detecting any irregularities that Silva may have committed: "At IU has always advocated that cases of this kind be fully transparent."
He added that part of the trainings was "the strict code of ethics for civil servants as well."
"May blood", the epic creation of Garci
Benito Pérez's Galdós National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish in May blood, which, with a budget of nearly €15 million, is the greatest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the flood of people and social analysis he had always admired in his well-known novelist's work. All this was said at the film premiere today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría to the popular audience of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour May blood is shown in cinemas on Friday, and later screened as a Telemadrid miniseries in a range of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, realized his childhood dream with this shooting. He owes it to Esperanza Aguirre because he commissioned him three years ago from Madrid Province to make a commemorative film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the invitation on condition that the story could be based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget was entirely funded by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and was a special opportunity for Garcia: he could present "the disturbed Spaniards, who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, as the struggle for independence pushed the country into a huge backward with Ferdinand VII's reign," he said.
Yet the director expressed regret that he could not count on the budget of the phantoms of Alatriste or Goya, which was more than double the May blood, which forced him to leave out some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, is recorded with Horacio Valcárcell.
So the director of the Restart resorted to his usual method of work, recording scenes with the actors he had begun rehearsals with before filming. Casting was not, because Garcia considers it "demeaning" and because, as he said, "part of the directorial craft is going to theatre and cinema to find out what is going on in the industry in which we work."
Several actors in May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, have not come before his camera for the first time.
Garci - who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Academy Award - believes that this year's candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. the May blood, the Seven French pool tables and none of the ultimately selected Blind sunflowers represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented," he said.
With this movie, Garcia doesn't expect awards.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that it's all about getting well, and in the end you're happy to have another film made," says Garci with a career of 30 years behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert on Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for women's equality, either Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing a corset that prevented women's freedom of movement.
He sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, he recommended Tortola to me, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell his life story, but to capture his soul.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, the tango of his "flash dance" to the guaji, or the "snake dance".
"He danced sensibly and others say it also characterizes my style," he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda now sings again after the Open Door at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the elder Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the invitation, I'm very honored to have you perform in my play."
In addition, the production is attended by music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, singers el Pulga and Moi de Morón; batsman El Pájaro, viola Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays the real diva a permanent character constantly besieging his love."
The play also largely illustrates the life of the woman, who lives in London, but also travels Europe, and reaches even remote landscapes at the time, including India, the United States, or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but at the same time he is no longer known and even less appreciated for his work today," says Bayón.
The performance starts tonight at 20.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
By the end of the Triennium, the diary of "A newlywed poet" will also appear.
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a newly married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of a series of programs titled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
In this way, the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium's closing date is the re-release of this work, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial house and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That bright poplar tree". The exhibition opened in May this year, visited several Andalusian provinces and was scheduled to visit New York by the time of the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America isn't so attractive.
"God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in the film The Victims of the Sensation and reflects the shock and inertia that Newman's death caused in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it was for him to get the Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
And he was known to be ill,
But even so, everyone was moved by his death.
"Sometimes it is impossible to put our feelings into words, and I have now lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "his existence has made my life and this country better."
No one feared that he might become ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the heroes of cinema and home passed away during a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many easily lose their virtues and very few people we can look up to remain, then it doesn't take Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men, he really embodied the platonic idea of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, ranging from the anti-drug foundation created in memory of his firstborn son who died of drug overdose to the creation of his domestic organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had difficulty moving beyond its suicidal nutritional culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration traversed all of Hollywood regardless of nationality and origin.
According to the last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, it was not a man, but an era that died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his direct greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," stated George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who today attempts to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle: they require honesty and privacy from serious and remote cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible in the midst of today's media jungle.
Yet some try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
He divorced once, but then lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for fifty years, even though he certainly would have had many occasions for disloyalty.
"Why should I eat burgers elsewhere when I've got roast meat at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you should be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
"He was not as proud of any of his performances as he was of the role of faithful husband, loving father, caring grandfather and devoted philanthropist," they say.
The rugged path of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it may become 2016.
But, I ask you, are we really prepared for this?
Because if we're starting from yesterday's race, I don't think we are.
They called it a perfect race, but in my view, it was the worst of many I've ever been to.
It was characterized by a multitude of incompetences, and if I ever had to be appreciated and I was the examiner, it would definitely be a failure.
But first things first, let's start at the beginning.
The senselessness began with the receipt of the serial number, as this required an early arrival.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, to avoid standing in the later line).
That's not what happened.
First only the serial number was handed over (first senseless, only to go there earlier) and (after the usual lineup), how surprising it was only an S T-shirt (second senseless, since I have exactly XL size)!
What world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, did they decide to save on the stuff and just buy cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed compared to what happened on race day.
In addition to having to go there terribly early to pick up the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be delivered.
The wait lasted longer than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't delivered the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was marked by attempts to rise up and stand-off.
I think maybe 500 of us will get pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, will not be able to get our place with our actual time, because I assume my chip was wrong to record the launch.
If you ask me about the perfect race, I wouldn't happen to think of that.
So I think we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for receptionist
At MIT's Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of -not very intelligent - artificial intelligence that can, however, perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle running on the company's territory) based on information heard from the conversation.
This "reception" can be used by a camera and a form and facial recognition system to recognize how many people are in the room, who they - even note what clothes they wear - and also hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group people in attendance based on conversations.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist lady identifies a third person, but knows that she is not part of the company she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to see someone and assures him that he will soon come to his aid.
All without the blue big screen.
Impressive.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people said this week that Microsoft was changing strategies.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers had just run the necessary programs instead of all the commercial junk, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
Spanish wax has been invented, given that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming more and more marginalized, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google had taken the first step to become a competitor for Windows.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operating system is to be counted, not in absolute, but in relative terms.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more attention to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time spent browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
So what is most of the application that comes with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less strained, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services on-line instead, and ultimately to be an alternative to Google.
They really need all this. I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in a lounge for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster invites them to use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent investigation found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced last week.
It does not arrive at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to put Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the market.
After all, the mobile phone is also becoming more and more a computer.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely make their business worse.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was worn by Pablo Picasso on Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford's Coppola's Godfather, as well as one of the basic costumes of the hardened gay purchasing public.
And speaking of specials, we might as well recall the peace figure of the traveling circus's cocky mustache weightlifter.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, "tank," as the English call it, but with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, none of his competitors can compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although only referred to among friends as "Marcel" - which he owes to sport, according to legend, he is named after Marcel Cerdan, singer Edith Piaf's lover.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex tailoring, specific emblem and the small (unrecognizable) Belgian flag are also visible among its competitors. The latter is carried by the most distinctive models hidden in the neck of the shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports uppers, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, navy shirts, baby clothes, minisorts - and even more - are all among the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable undergarments,
Although it is also regrettable that they must be worn as undergarments.
They're too good for that.
"I'd like to be a young mother, no matter who the father is"
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he succeeded in accomplishing himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Right now, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than some pretty and pretty girls putting their name on something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris, as well as the award of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It gives you a gripping warmth and mildness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We are presenting Mango's new autumn-winter collection, designed with my brother Penalope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second application for 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango.
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; from there we took over a lot.
And then, many times, I'm just walking around town watching women dress, vary and sort their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You also work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer.
That's what I think, but after all, these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes when I was a kid, so I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and go through my aunt's closets.
Now, that was the Canaan itself, almost worth an amusement park.
And then, as a dancer, I always tried to keep an eye on my clothes.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for classes and rehearsals so we can have fun looking in the mirror.
And in the role of actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected to everything, and with all due respect to designers and their expertise.
Didn't you just celebrate your 30th birthday?
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think that's when women really reach, they're experienced enough, and they make fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been doing what I want to do, and it gives me great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and in fact, I want to be a young mother, and I certainly don't want to miss that.
And as for the future father, it doesn't matter who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you made several movies that haven't been shown yet.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to get out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything immediately, but of course I know it's impossible.
I look forward to being presented with the last hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them.
I understand you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own organization called Women for a Better World.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much going on about him, I know him, and I can assure you that none of it is true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of his activities.
He asked me to do the fashion show for a reason, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do it.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don't know anything impossible.
Repeated drunk drivers will be ordered to install "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving violations, the Ministry of the Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver was in a state of drunkenness or did not blow into the structure.
The proposal was presented in June and is now being dealt with by the State Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will last for a year.
Since the aim of the project is to re-enter the market, the driver will also have to attend a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the Attorney General for Transport Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Auto Safety Technology Foundation (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30–75% of motorists arrested several times due to drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air sprayed in it. If it is greater than allowed, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be borne by the infringer.
A relevant study in the US in 2007 demonstrated that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 people each year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from turning into criminal offences,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce as the legal reform is being implemented in the usual way, while the necessary reform in criminal matters would require an amendment of the basic law.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party which, on a French model, calls for the system to be installed in school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English precision, at the time announced in the program, at 5:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force Prince's Party transport plane landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport, Mexico City.
The sun was on its way down, but it was still so blazing that we could only see the royal couple leaving the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours earlier, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Prince's Couple were coming to town for an official visit.
Okay, well, there won't be an airport transfer for a while... she's from around here or something.
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish. She just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press, they know all about the Asturasi Princes' Party and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon created by 27 naval soldiers who provide protection for dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling, dressed in sea blue, and then the Princess, in her long hair, gets caught in the wind, in a restrained dress, but not in the usual shoes flashing toes - perhaps warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception follows.
At the gate of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - they are waiting for a talkative reporter on Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
The best place in the world to award a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and the coolest of today's fashion designers is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards' second tender aimed at internationalizing the young talents of the fashion profession.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first tender, saw her own design clothes in the display of the Paris boulevard Haussmann under 54 Mango and was almost relieved.
By the way, this is the company's second largest European business and recently opened at 1,335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
Amidst the many events and the thanks for Valentino's presiding of the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagalok, his presidential table prepared by the gala dinner Mango showed even more spectacular.
Nati, who had come with a heavy heart and sadness due to the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some of the ELAH’s breathtaking ornaments, escorting Valentin to the main table of dinner in his honor with his nearly two - meter - tall son Luis.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests. Along with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit, as it was both gifted to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store wearing her own-designed pants and shirt, and at dinner she was wearing a sexy long black dress. On the night's opera visit, Gaya became so enthralled in the ballet room that, recalling the old days, she swam up to one of the bars and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but before he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he was about two meters tall and riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental hotel in Paris. He also brought his own sheets and towels with him, and it was well anticipated that he would not ask for any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
It's not 1,000, it's 1,000 and there's one way to turn off chaotic and messy everyday life.
Further good news is that we can find them all in a single book that arrives at bookstores on September 30 to bring peace with it.
It's almost a torture to hear the clock ringing at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to think how fast-paced the world is to force you to live every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer is back pain.
Stress is the people's disease of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two ways to overcome daily exhaustion nor to bridge workplace problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the solution that is most pleasing and adaptable to their free minutes.
The stress relief work is titled the 1001 relaxation method and the calm from it comes to the bookstores from the Pearson Alhambra y DK label.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly sway your faith.
In addition, it also offers other ideas that help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline level has become too low to refresh your body and become the central problem in your stress life, it's time to sit back in your chair, relax and focus on reading only.
Who speak in their sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and fully alertly describe what happened to them that day, but those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure more of you have been told that you spoke at night.
Regarding its frequency, it may be completely rhapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a high fever illness), or more regular (every day, weekly or once a month), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single underlying cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nocturnal uproars, nighttime bed wetting (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but it is not legal either.
As already mentioned, it may be a condition with a high fever, or even an accompanying phenomenon of stress or increased excitement.
In any case, it's been poorly studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, may consist of incoherent words, murmuring, but unlike all of these, it may also take the form of shouting, crying, or longer speaking.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and contact the specialist. The study may reveal whether there is a problem that causes a great deal of anxiety and can therefore provide a solution.
As mentioned above, this is a benign phenomenon and consequently there is no cure unless it is accompanied by another treatable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
But there are some things we can do, and here's a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure that the child remains calm before going to bed.
Choose comforting games and avoid children watching fear - inspiring or more aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who tend to be nervous or have difficulty relaxing, we teach them some relaxation methods to find inner peace more easily.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
If you do start talking while you're sleeping, let's try to keep calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the child is unconscious, but he'd be out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Remember, if you are often accompanied by intense anxiety, it is advisable to consult a specialist or to explore what causes the child to become very anxious.
If you speak plainly (this is a rarer case), do not start asking questions to learn anything from him.
It wouldn't be necessary, because he's not conscious enough to collect his thoughts while he's asleep.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you do not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and with possible conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid they can question him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally, Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took on a new momentum and won again at home.
Although there was no awesome game, the yellow-blacks were in several situations, one of which they could eventually win by taking advantage.
The pace of the match was not too tight as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The shot to the first gate was attempted by the guest team captain Kauffmann, however, the distant ball just touched the upper corner of the gate tree. Then the Illhaeusern came to the top, and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried a distant shot, and then Hirn's shot went over the gate. Romain sniffed, and Diebold also tried to shake Dannemarie's defense with a remote attempt.
On the other side, players teamed up in a block to defend themselves in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on the Dannemarie side. Immediately after that, the first goal was born: after Diebold's first shot, the Marais of Illhaeusern obtained it with an excellent position and then put it in the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausen's goaltender could not enjoy the glory for long: he was forced to leave the field twelve minutes later, so his teammates had to continue the fight at a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, was unable to take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who had just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defence. The last seconds alone had some excitement when the ball came very close to the goalpost after a big rush.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen crippled the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to receive the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would arrive with "specific proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in gas oil prices, as oil prices exceeded the average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to David Martinon, spokesperson for the President of the Republic, the President will "negotiate with fishermen on ways to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers".
The fishermen are determined to await Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
On Tuesday morning, traffic slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, causing congestion nearly 10 km long.
Transport of Quiberon's yacht port was also crippled, but roads to Belle-île were not blocked.
Roadblocks were placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination. At dawn, tyres and pallets were set on fire outside the fuel depots of the Bresti ports while protests took place in both Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manche. For example, in Sables d'Olonne, Vendée County, fishermen did not board a ship, while in Le Havre some twenty ships were hindering the traffic of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in Loire-Atlantique County abolished the huge Total oil refinery blockade operating in Donges in the evening.
On the other hand, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the ministry by deciding on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on its next step and participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee, as the committee did not support their aspirations.
"The strike continues" because "fishers refuse to yield their demands" and "they refuse to travel to Paris", for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Fisheries Commission in Lorient, announced.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but believe that the only way to make a ship profitable is to lower the price of diesel to less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was caught in his home in Connecticut at age 83 due to death, cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also paid their respects to the actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83, who was dedicated to his cinema legend and vocation.
Embraer does not change its delivery plans for 2008
Despite the crisis threatening the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The world's fourth largest aircraft company, Embraer, can hold the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is highly relevant to the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
So far, Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers over eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, set up by U.S. financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets so that it can repay the 85 billion in advance, said the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
Apart from its international life insurance and US pension insurance activities, AIG would divest most of its other business, the newspaper clarified, which cited sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sales.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the company's aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments - the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no definitive decision yet on the sale.
AIG must quickly obtain liquid assets to repay the US government-sanctioned loan of $85 billion, taking the risk that it will have to divest up to 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders in a corresponding proportion.
Paris Historique's study on the historic Morning Meeting meeting of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which means a decline of nearly 800 points never seen), and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) sank by 777.68 points, closing at 10,365.45 points.
The largest drop in the index to date (684.81 points) was registered on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed following the terrorist attack on September 11.
Nasdaq, based mainly on technology papers, closed with a drop of 199.61 points at 1,983.73 points, while the expanded index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was indisposed as early as the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly refused a bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it began a deep flight.
Members declined to provide the funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson by 228 "no" votes to 205 "yes".
The plan was voted out by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
"From this, the market has filtered down bad signs as Congress seems unable to approve a plan," believes Lindsey Piegza, an analyst for FTN Financial.
"It also shows how much the market expected this plan," he added, and then expressed his concern that if such a plan were accepted a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really doomed (...), then it will be up to the Fed (American central bank - the ed.) and the other central banks to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will continue to tighten," warn Brian Bethune, Global Insight's leading economist.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds, "every day passed, newer financial institutions are going bankrupt" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of the Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities made sure Wachovia's banking business was acquired by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which has required emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has developed "not only an American but a global crisis", adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has been substantially revived.
The 10-year government bond yield fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening, and the 30-year old's fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first televised duel
Friday, the first debate of the two U.S. presidential candidates was followed by another that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be out of the duel as winners.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign leaders claimed the victory in the television duel that was monitored by a third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was honorable, it did not prove to be "enthralling" enough to halt his decline in popularity: this is evidenced by surveys taken five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate stands better in the fight: according to poll results published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point lead over McCain (44% and 49% respectively).
Among the most calculating, undecided voters, 39% of those polled say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a survey conducted by CBS.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his fellow party Joseph Biden's promising Thursday appearance, preparing for Biden's first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
However, Bill Clinton warned this weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts.".
McCain, in his 70s, never fails to prioritise his own undisputed vast foreign policy experience. However, he emphasizes his opponent's "naivity" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." - the attack has been said on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the position of president," McCain stated.
This is the main attack surface that is also exploited by Republican TV advertisements running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he put it together and accurately.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama does" - was cut back by the Democratic ad broadcast over the weekend, which points out to the Republican leader that he still hasn't assessed the impact of the crisis on the American "people of the street".
"During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama stated yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the rain in North Carolina for the voter's meeting.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers" on his mouth. The troubled situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom Americans consider best suited to save the economy on the verge of collapse.
"Next week could prove to be a turning point," Charles Schumer, influential Democratic Senator, said yesterday.
Democrat MP Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton government, said Obama has "excellent instincts in the field of the economy" such as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is the "final judgment over the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois Senator has reaffirmed his ability to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans despite stock market fluctuations. He added that his primary goals include establishing the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to establish 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided issues concerning the $700 billion (€470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, following the closing of polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square to protest the falsification of election results.
Although no results have yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the words "Mr. Dictator, resign!".
Some admit that they haven't even gone to vote: "Why would I go? They're doing what they want with my vote anyway," says a young man.
Protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to make itself visible to foreign observers for the purpose of building relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were to be judged clear by observers, they could lift the sanctions imposed on the country, whereby 40 Belarusian leaders were denied visas and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were kept away from the election committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," regretted Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesperson for the twelve parties, so heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were merely nominal," stresses Alexander Milinkievich, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case this executive power.
If opposition delegates get into parliament, that means they have been appointed rather than elected.
But their access to parliament allows them to get a seat on television, to meet in the country's regions and to submit bills.
The opposition must therefore take action in political life, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our economy is seriously indebted to Russia and we are not able to renew, we are risking falling under Russia's control.
We, on the other hand, want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which monitors the election process, will accept the outcome of the vote as valid.
They stress that the turnout rate seems too high, and the widespread organisation of the preliminary vote (which involved 26% of voters in Minsk) provided the opportunity for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was released from prison in August this year for the last time, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
Parliament will include up to five opposition representatives, those who are most in line with leadership.
The silence of the night falls again on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the central election committee are delighted.
Blood is safe again
The Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday. President Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate because Héma-Québec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood-giving societies in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people's trust, which was severely shaken by the 1980s and 1990s scandal about infected blood.
As is known, the national blood reserve treated by the Red Cross blood supply service in Canada was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general upheaval, the Government of Canada launched a formal investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make suggestions to avoid similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee served this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one by Héma-Québec serving Quebec, and the other by all other provinces and the Canadian Blood Supply Society responsible for supplying the two territories.
"When Héma-Québec began its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system," Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, we managed to regain the trust of people as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the area." Décary proudly states that almost 94% of the Quebec population already considered Héma-Québec to be reliable in early 2008.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since the foundation of Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, a number of cases of mad cow disease, the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its founding in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we have relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain changes, thus inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, no doubt, it was found that the disease spreads through blood.
This incident convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique was released on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV virus. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, rather than antibodies to the virus on which previously used tests were built.
The NAT test allowed us to shorten the window period, which will keep us from getting infected until we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical tools, explains the expert.
This period could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk that blood donors could unknowingly infect blood and that this could not be detected.
These improvements greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of receiving HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products while someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to become infected with HIV via a blood product.
I think that today anyone can accept or prescribe blood transfusions in order to restore health, says the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen will enter the system.
After all, it was only last year that the chikungunya virus was released on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must be constantly on guard," Dr. Décary continued, and then stressed that besides emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserve.
"As the population ages, demand is also increasing.
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor population, as the number of people in the network who are eligible for blood donation accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, every healthy person aged at least 18 years who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria and those who have visited a country where malaria kills are not entitled to donate blood for a year.
"With this 3 percent we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones are getting older, because they can't give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In this rushing world today, you barely have one hour to go and give blood," Sorry Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec, a farmer of the 297 million dollar annual budget, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeball tissues, and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severely burned persons.
These tissues are analyzed, modified, and frozen, and then placed at Héma-Québec, which also manages Quebec's only public stem cell bank.
Once treated as medical waste, blood can be obtained from umbilical cords that are rich in stem cells, thus allowing for the treatment of severe diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago that the thousandth cord blood sample entered our bank, and we plan to take over a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we are probably starting to offer these for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who said that the cord blood removal program is very popular nowadays.
"Many mothers are sad that they don't have the opportunity to do so" - that is indeed true, as Héma-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - in the semifinals of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated the Seattle Sounders 3:1 yesterday in the USL-1 qualifier and reached the semifinals with the overall 4:3 result. This was the second quarter-final and crucial match for overall results that took place at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second, Montreal team's two midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino both found themselves in the opponent's net.
Only Roger Levesque of the Sounders team managed to play goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
Remember, in his first match on Friday, Impact lost 2:1 to Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle suburbs.
Impact plays with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which lost 3–1 to the Whitecaps in the first game, won 4–3, however, the Whitecaps reached the semifinals with a 5–4 overall result.
Impact is expected to meet with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but match details are being specified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
Canadiens' favorite triad is ready for another season.
The Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and eventually the Canadiens won 3–2 from penalty shots against the Florida Panthers at Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored one goal. Plekanec finished the match with two and Kovalev with one goal, which was the fourth win out of the team's six preparation games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shoot-out.
"I'm not ready yet," warns Russian player.
"I need another game to really feel in shape."
"He tried too much to get out of himself in the first third," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy about the outcome of the game.
He got a huge ovation."
Charest's Northern aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will start this year
Shortly after the Liberal Party meeting ended, Jean Charest traveled yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is breaking to victory in the by-election to be held today.
"Holding back our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at his meeting in the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday. The speech was enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the point.
During his performance, behind his back, he screened images similar to "Moulin à images".
On the three giant projectors, impressive images followed each other: dams of hydroelectric power plants, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "north plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" of Quebec's future, embodied in a "new economic area". It includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several conventions planned with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area beginning at latitude 49) has often been featured in the Prime Minister's speeches, but has never given a talk on this subject.
However, the head of state merely explained why he considered the North to be "a treasure mine with huge potential". However, he did not mention the time factor, investment amounts, or specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few opportunities for development: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of countries in catch-up and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
It is located in the north "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," he listed Chares.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", is "our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is found not only in us but in us," the head of state repeated, stressing that he intended to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the Quebec design work, James Bay...
"It's ours, it's our future!" he added, after taking a theatrical break and examining the huge map behind his back.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec's territory, also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed for itself, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a boundary on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if an opportunity arises, I will reconfirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he stated.
On the other hand, "we also need to reconsider our point of view on the North in the light of climate change", said the Prime Minister speaking of the northwest passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of the polar ice.
In the Prime Minister's view, taking the territory in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
What about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec is paying particular attention to them and that the plan will benefit them much, especially young people.
The two ministers belonging to the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter being delegates to the Parti Québécois ungava), have already begun to consult with about thirty local communities.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee led by Benoît Pelletier also began to operate, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where they "create a common vision".
The North would otherwise be developed in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, system-integrated and environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as consistent with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers preceding him.
"Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with a large cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party president on Friday.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power station be renamed the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"The politicians of our party, including the Godbout who founded Hydro-Québec, Lesage implementing the silent revolution and national distribution of hydroelectric power stations, or Bourass, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future," Jean Charest stated.
At the press conference, he also cited another - true, conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister's "Roads to the North" program between 1957 and 1963.
Regarding the plan for the dam of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric plant, President Charest stressed that the commissioning was planned for 2012.
"This is between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement was received by a loud applause storm.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his calendar was already full, as he assumed duties at the federal council meeting in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party assembly held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to explain the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without hesitation. It is mainly about the "constitutional aspirations": the Liberal party demands in particular recognition of the "specific nature of Quebec" in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members have veto rights in relation to decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, received the main points of the Northern Plan skeptically.
Parti Québécois leader Paulina Marois re-emphasized North Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the Liberal government that came into power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn't, "we'd be much ahead today," Mrs Marois said in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who she launched today as a candidate in the vote in Jean-Talon.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"We do, however, want this not to be a mere act," noted party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A disgraced country
Vic Toews, minister of the Harper Cabinet (also "justice" minister), took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbour Canada "true".
To desecrate a woman who has fought for justice incessantly and deserves all our admiration - this also tells us a great deal about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is therefore our government, who alone of the Western countries concerned did not return his own citizen from the concentration camp in Guantánamo.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes charged to him.
It is the only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child soldier to suffer under inhumane conditions.
The only government to make puppet theater in justice while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian lawyers' association are also demanding Omar Khadr be returned home so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government turns a blind eye to the torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been psychologically destroyed, and all these years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not aware of this at the moment, at present the insidious destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy is taking place. "Democracy": Harper constantly voices this word, which sounds like an empty voice from his mouth.
So the time has come when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen, according to the will of the leader of a government which was so far a minority (and what can come after October 14...?).
Many electorate believe that salvation can be found with a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order. They do not see that this government tramples on the values to which our country owes its good reputation and dignity.
My dear Mr Toews, shame is more like this - don't look elsewhere.
Opinion - Orwell oratory of Barrick Gold
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president and CEO of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada, was published in the September 17 issue of Le Devoir.
Following Orwelli's discussion, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has filed a $6 million libel suit against three authors and a small-money publishing company in order to initiate a so-called "public debate".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision is made, especially in defamation trials, not by truth, but by law.
Not surprisingly, Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Would it really be the best way for Barrick Gold to argue in public to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant sums of money on defense and struggle in an unequal fight where on the other side there is an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible sources of the mining industry.
Otherwise, in such an unequal struggle, the tactic is often used to destroy the defendant and reach a friendly agreement that not only silences the opposite, but even intimidates those who would try to re-emerge the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views to the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is done differently, in Canada, contentious parties generally do not strike each other with sticks but express their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have been enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public and sweeps aside petitions and letters written in defense of the authors of Noir Canada in one move.
Perhaps you could explain to Mr Garver how you can initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, you ignore this public opinion?
In the Deputy President's mind, this word probably means only lawyers who have been paid handsomely, rather than the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is thus greatly narrowed down.
Even those derogatory to others in a democratic state deserve freedom of speech.
However, what Barrick Gold does not understand - or do not want to understand - is that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are mainly supported by the public because it condemns the rough procedure of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but this would be done on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a lawsuit for silence for many. (In relation to the term "public debate", Barrick Gold recently called on Noir Canada authors in writing to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal explanations, the Barrick Gold procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
The procedure as a whole denies the right to quote credible sources, something to debate about facts and their interpretation, which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it is only possible to study and discuss subjects that are not pleasing to the rich companies of today's world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to respond.
For a long time in our university, we have been able to deal with disputes, disagreements and conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unthinkable procedure shows that, contrary to its claim, it was not in the mood to have a debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debates in Canada, and it is time for governments to finally put in place measures that restrict legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street rescue mission - Democrats and Republicans agreed
Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush administration and Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue operation, which is the largest such plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
A plan worth US$700 billion, aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has raged on Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure repayment of planned state funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized due to non-payments; right of access to the salaries of the managers of assisted companies.
U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. House of Representatives and Judd Gregg, Republican MP in the trial, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets," stated Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush administration.
"We have done everything to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis that has hit Wall Street," the Democrat MP explained.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, then shock, chaos and confusion will be huge in the daily lives of Americans," Republican Representative Judd Gregg said.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours fearing another failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors.
The agreement was granted until the opening of the stock exchange this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, but they did not welcome the fact that the situation had escalated to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited himself with expanding the agreement with elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of house ownership or the payment of executives of companies assisted by the state.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of other people's irresponsibility, it is not very welcome.
But these steps are necessary," he noted on an American television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to know the details, but I hope I do."
"What I have read in broad lines is already visible from what we all need to digest and by which we can move on.
The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would be used to buy the dubious demands of American financial institutions, some risky, unsellable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis initiated by the bursting of real estate balloons. This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt (trade) securities, and eventually caused the freeze of liquid funds and the upheaval of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was overthrown by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to provide certain "toxic" devices for companies in difficulty rather than being acquired by the government.
In order for all members of Congress to be satisfied, the plan also included a provision requiring that if the government has to bear losses under the program for five years, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion installment would first be paid; a further $100 billion may be followed if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of the remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress by another vote.
In return for the help, Washington acquires a stake in the supported companies, whereby he receives dividends from the profits and can sell it after the crisis has gone down.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan and to set the maximum wage and severance payments that can be paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters would like the plan to be voted on by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, statements opposing the plan were repeated among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is absolutely clear that Washington does not hear your voice," stated Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would benefit taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a Democratic representative leading a small congressional grouping called the "sceptic faction", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel laureates scientists, wrote to us to ask Congress not to rush and to examine carefully which path it chooses," Sherman stated yesterday.
In Europe, once again, it was understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalise part of the Fortis banking group worth EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its rival on the verge of bankruptcy after losing €2 million (US$2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis in secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
Fortis with 85,000 employees is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not thrown out money," Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"We gain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly the kind of thing that depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Manche, the British government seems to be about to nationalize another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total of Bradford and Bringley bank's ongoing loans, of which real estate loans amount to £41 billion (US$75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would acquire the subsidiaries and customer stock of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would thus be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the acting idol
Her beautiful azure eyes are said to have been her greatest trump card, and her greatest weakness, according to others.
Did the charming American actor ever get rid of his daffodil mirror?
Yes and no.
Through his shyness, sensitivity, and innate talent, he also lacked the harsh style that is the essence of the true great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge career he's made!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on Friday at his estate in Connecticut. He was one of the last icons of American cinema's flourish.
He was less monumental than Brando, who was a rival on the screen for a long time. He was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his roles, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results in extraordinary children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian descent.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic forms of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only enhanced his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied at Yale University drama and then at Actor's Studio in New York before it exploded into the world of theatre, television and cinema.
In addition to being a top civil rights fighter, he won second place as a racing driver in 1979 in the 24-hour race at Le Mans. However, he was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we'll never know what the downsides of this mysterious, closed-minded actor's life, dedicated to his work, who hated the glamour of show-business, will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked cinema fans: in his great roles we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Reviewing his life's work, the seventh American art flashes before us, the cinema with constant changes for over fifty years.
In our memory we are mixed with the charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the estranged young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), in whose role we saw him in Tennessee Williams processing "Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
From recent times (1990), he can be remembered in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age by the fact that his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
Paul Newman also had many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Up There" he performed an unforgettable performance in the role of stormy-lived criminal-boxer Rocky Graziano. This role originally intended for James Dean - and taken over after his death - started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Big Bang", which won the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's brilliant film "The Swindler" (1961), he played a bitter, vengeful pool player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money". He received his only Oscar from nine nominations in 1987 for the latter's performance.
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by changes in ages.
The younger are mainly known from George Roy Hill's cult film "Icebreakers" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, a coach for an ice hockey team who works with unconventional methods.
His fans could see him in the "The Great Jump" recorded by the Coen brothers in 1994.
The line was closed by Sam Mendes's film "The Way of Damnation" in 2003: in which he last appeared as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many cinema legends who had left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood along with its glamour, glare, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not view it as "a living rebuttal of underplay" without any humor: he thought his play was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always gracious to the handsome Paul Newman, whose film roles fell on his lap for a long time.
Yet, he rarely played young and successful characters: instead, he formed figures living on the edge of society — neurotic, alcoholic, malignant, or hopeless — whose drift and rebellion he was able to return with perfect credibility.
As a director, he showed a less-known face of Newman: a truly coy and sensitive man deep in his soul.
In the film "Rachel, Rachel" (which is an adaptation of Canadian writer Margaret Laurence's novel) directed in 1968, she drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role.
He commemorates his son Scott, who died of drug overdose with a film entitled "Harry and his son" made in 1984, with restrainedness and sadness.
Yesterday, many of Newman's admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old fellow fighter Robert Redford (who was playing with him in "The Big Bang" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said with grief: "His presence made my life and the world better.
Generousity and joy of being: that was the secret to the vibrant personality of this great actor, whom we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent film production and his comments critical of Hollywood's debauchery are obscured.
We could often see his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits, and other foods. He did it with a bad taste in the mouth, although he thought it was funny at first.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to his foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all along.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father has always and all along been unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are charged with fraud and other crimes, including forgery, which cause particularly significant damage to the criminal organisation.
According to the D.A.'s office, the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the tasks were often verified with false invoices.
State and municipal funds - HUF 65 million in total - migrated partly into the register of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of some individuals.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the tender money received was taken up on the basis of cost accounts that did not have a real performance behind them, and the associations never complied with the commitment they had undertaken.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
To these, bill blocks were acquired in the market in Jozsefváros, and circular stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
To which companies the account was made, it was decided, among other things, on the Balaton-felvidéki körút to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to look like boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, and the invoices to be submitted to the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour portfolio and the Metropolitan Municipality were then prepared.
These were mostly noted by István Lados with his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, wrote most of the accounts needed to obtain the grants.
One of Lados's "study trips" targets was a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlags, dated 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for the 90-person group of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, so many people - according to the company manager - would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation for the Better Future - together for the Third Generation - was filled with formal and content errors.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj was only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the bill was about one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative forms fillers were overstated even when they marked Pigal Kft., which also engaged in hospitality, whose accounts - according to the information given to the prosecution - did not include documents for the Better Future and the name of the Oops.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was called up to the prosecutor's office and billed him, he immediately knew it was fake documents.
"The stamp had our business name and tax number in the wrong place."
He added that, apart from formal reasons, it was not correct that a hundred people were accommodated according to the account, because they had a total of eleven rooms in which there were no seats.
Plus, the bill was for dining while their restaurant was long gone.
The eager account makers also did not find out that the Budapest travel agency they looked for was only organizing trips abroad, so they did not sign up for travel in Hungary as a service in the cash payment account, which also did not match the company's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was included on the document, even though travel to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for Better Future, because the company's service is not charged by the designated 25 percent VAT, but by 15 percent VAT.
In addition, the "exhibitors" have also ruined the account by marking road freight transport as an activity carried out in the case of a company - it has been revealed through the prosecution procedure - which the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not pursue.
In addition, due to formal differences - inadequate account format, not true stamp - it was also found that the accounts for the Together Third Generation Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner's Point were false.
As with Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that the invoices were issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Ltd. in Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the Young City Association group was eating there, and therefore the company's liquidator commissioner, as far as we know, denied that he would have issued the paper.
Consciously exhibited
Another group of account issuers is those who were aware of the need to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Foundation for the Third Regiment at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, for about four million HUF.
The head of Collab Kft., according to the indictment, was persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious bill.
Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation, also collaborated with the Zuschlags, which provided the Foundation for Better Future, Atlas Association and Redwood Association with invoices worth roughly five million HUF, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Neither did the cash movement, because the invoices were cancelled afterwards, but the organisations had forgotten to include them in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice shall be those linked to the defendants.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was responsible for the delivery of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., based in Budapest.
The company issued several invoices on the sale of computer tools in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd. of Kiskunhalasi, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The executive of this company was a Romanian man to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov admitted in the course of the investigation that he issued an invoice for the Atlas, the Oops and the Foundation for the Third Generation together, and that he took their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, the reason was that they were not given a job.
However, the companies benefited because, at the request of his fellow accused partner Zsolt Szente, who also produced the documents of the company's foundings, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations connected to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Cubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million.
The D.A.'s office believed that 10 percent of the bills and VAT hit Cubatov's grip.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to exhibit fictitious invoices, which were produced for the application of the Commissioner Point.
The Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted a tender to the Socialist Party's public benefit organization, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA), in January 2006.
They won 500-500 thousand forints, but the funds were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to reveal this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found during the search at Árpád Kemecsei's office at the educational wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did in the prosecution, are likely to report on the process of bill-making.
It may be most interesting if the prime defendant himself, John Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil about everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his best interest or whether the Socialists made a deal with him in return for the compensation of most of the damage, 50 million forints, and Zusi takes the fall.
Who, by the way, may have been offended today, for his requests to relieve the circumstances of his detention, or to place him under house arrest, have constantly found deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater harm and do not convert them can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, he is not allowed to do so.
The psychology of overbiding: why are we releasing more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in Science magazine, people do not want to be left behind in a type of competition such as eBay’s auction, so they pay too high a price.
The research tried to map the nervous system scheme of this "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers lotteryd, and the other group participated in a player auction while examining the active brain areas of experimental individuals using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which overbiding the other party is an essential element - the striatum, sub-brain cortex complex was activated intensely upon the loss of the game.
This brain area plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system among several other functions.
Therefore, researchers believe that the upheaval of the price can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theory, the members of the research group economist also conducted a financial follow-up investigation.
In this, three groups bid against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product concerned and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they were out of the game in a win, they would be rewarded with $15 in cash.
The third group, on the other hand, had just received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the group members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was merely that for one of them, they emphasized winning, and for another, losing.
However, proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and "winner" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
To date, they have only explained the events of the auction with the joy of winning and avoiding risks.
Only neurological imaging methods helped resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now coming to a third explanation," stated Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected with hepatitis at home is 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated, which is why patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a common name for infections of the liver caused by different viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, characteristic of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ.
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sudder, vaginal discharge, saliva).
Travelers should definitely be vaccinated against A and B viruses, and there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints and nausea.
Thereafter, jaundice on the skin and whites of the eyes develops, stools become light, urine becomes dark, healing may take two to three weeks.
A million people die worldwide from more serious types of disease, hepatitis B liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only 1 in 10 infected patients receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the pathogen insidiously destroys their liver cells, in many cases they don't show their first symptoms until 20 to 30 years later.
Thus, it is very important that early prevention and regular screening tests are carried out.
There are far more than average cases in three groups: between people undergoing blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
There are currently 200 million chronic hepatitis C infections in the world.
Since the disease may already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to contact the GP if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
Recognizing the disease in time can be cured, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating infection and preventing cancer from developing.
September 30 is the World Day for Hepatitis, first held in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a painkiller that could have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects people's sense of pain, reported by the British Telegraph.
In the framework of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were electroshocked while all were studying a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for controlling pain.
The inquiry is the first in a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers, and theologians participate from various parts of the university.
The investigation took place precisely by attaching a sparking device to the left hand of the experimental subject, which provided the electroshock.
Researchers asked those involved in the experiment to look strongly at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's picture of Lady with Hermelin painted in the 15th century.
The investigators hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause a kind of religious state among believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to be soothing.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts while either looking at the religious-themed or general image.
Catholics reported that while seeing Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" like they were "careful" and "rested, filled with peace".
While watching the religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when they saw Leonardo’s creation before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including atheists, only the right photo should be found.
"We should find a picture for whom they feel very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases changes our personality," Wright added.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber showed a picture of a madonna to the believers, what effect would that have on their pain control?
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can say: it is found in people's pockets as much as it is above their heads in the sky; he knows where they vacationed, what special orders they attend, and what they are interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top executives.
As for the skeptics that parallel Orwell's horrifying image, they don't see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about their users, and this is necessary for them to be able to stick to the original goal of Google founders, which was to "collect all the information in the world!".
According to the Google leader voiced, after ten years of subversive work, the company is still at the beginning of managing all the information.
On the question of what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: do you want Google to be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would I really do?" - but until then, the software cannot answer questions that seem so simple because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact location of their queries when searching the Internet, the IP address they were looking for and the page they left after searching.
With the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their own surfing backstory, look back at what they were looking for, what they were looking for, and thus generate much more personalised hits for them in the long run - based on the same logic Recommendations will offer us products and services based on our previously told and recorded preferences.
What if my data is used against me, if you look at what I do? - asked by users who are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or rebellion against power, triggering counter-reactions in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the terms sought are not only recorded, but may also be handed over to third parties where appropriate, in such legal cases there is no protection of the privacy of Internet users.
Perhaps the loudest example of this has been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information on pedophiles from the community side Orkut it maintains, allowing identification.
On the other hand, Internet users concerned about privacy rights could sigh in May, when the company, in conjunction with the EFF electronic rights protection organization, successfully proved its case in court against the FBI: that Google could not be forced to provide any information requested in secret by the FBI at any point in the constitution afterwards.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought off some fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it gained by reference to the ratification of the Child Protection Act adopted years earlier, but failed to obtain search lists for individual users, or a full website and keyword list covering two months.)
So Google's perception is rather controversial: it is being beaten by those who fear the provision of their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy are squandering by starting to use Google's services and by the rebellion that is directed against them by the multi-companies that shine in conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users appearing in many countries see in them the next generation of big companies, "cool corporation", unlike its rival Microsoft, who is world conqueror due to Windows, however much both struggle for the same goal.
This can happen because Google does not request an identification code from its users in a way other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, continuously kept fresh source code and program package seems much more accessible, youthful, cooler than its official software giant practice.
However, it can also happen that geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy rights and the Internet, which has been followed by the web 2.0, one of the most frequently spoken keywords of recent years.
Because the web 2.0 is about collaboration, about deliberately leaving clues behind and taking advantage of the communication channels at our disposal, and while the extent of these changes varies from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can drive a profile from Facebook to Xanga on several social media sites, connect them to other services such as Twitter, or last.fm listing his music habits, and then connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, they can also host blogs that automatically display their latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about a number of exemplary cases from which it is clear: the girlfriend easily realizes the morning photo stream of the common circle of friends, seeing who her fraudulent friend has spent the evening with or can fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion on senior management in her blog: one thing is certain that the concept of privacy has been completely re-evaluated by now.
Those who live online are made up of what they show themselves, which is the basic principle behind the behaviour of young people today.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid Google monopoly, can do so (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system, but not intentionally leaving a trace).
For example, the number of people who deliberately don't register for social networking sites so that they can't be found, Google's online applications can be replaced by alternative versions from the text editor to the image manager and newsreader, which do not connect to huge server parks and which do not compile the best profile that has ever existed from us.
The public isn't so secretly waiting for Google to show their teeth protein.
With the company's current value of $156 billion, it is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten advertising agencies' revenues, and services introduced at an ever-accelerating pace cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft but also to many other software developers.
However, critical bystanders also find the counterpoints that are disturbing: for example, the senior management completely rejected the protests of employees after doubling the company kindergarten fee, found it too costly to feed employees on a daily basis, but they are all dwarfed by the fact that Google bowed its head to the Chinese government in 2006 and under their agreement, the company filters out any hits that violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that no new service is announced, only when it can be used, but sure, the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is so large that the company will soon have to face the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear the Health system, in which we can build a full health profile of ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database can also give a good input to the next generation of science fiction writers, with the popular Cory Doctorow novel Scroogled point orwelli overtones describing the future in which a man can only be alarmingly well approached from Google data.
Two juveniles helped the Osdian double killer to cover his tracks.
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in the Osdi double murder case, with reasonable suspicion that they helped cover up traces of the crime, said a spokesperson for the Borsod County Police Headquarters on Tuesday.
The youths have acknowledged the act they are burdened with, currently accusing them of aiding and abetting.
The two minors - according to information from the MTI, two girls - are at large.
Aiding and abetting may be punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the Osdi double murder - a 23-year-old local man - was placed in custody on Sunday.
He's been premeditated for profit, charged with the murder of several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old young man owed a greater amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor to a place last Wednesday where he killed her and then the man's nine-year-old daughter.
According to information from MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, a sign of which is that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the conditions of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange bid to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech koruna - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the 100 % stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been disqualified by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell over 60 percent of the papers in a few months.
The Czech Economic Daily E15 is new to know that the Polish offer represents the highest amount that has been offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of the interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts at 5-10 billion kroner.
Shareholders agree that about 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with about 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
From the perspective of the European newspapers on the financial crisis
The European papers leading in their commentaries on Tuesday devoted to the deepening international financial crisis already refer to "11 September the second".
We owe the global financial disaster to the U.S. President - accused by La Repubblica in Rome - the President was not even able to line up his own party behind that hurried bill to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about second September 11.
Some of the Madrid press also see the scapegoat in Washington.
In El Mundo's view, the lack of political leadership there brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but in the wake of the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - points out the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Today, some states can still provide a lifeline for supporting financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if more banks collapse like domino cubes, neither funds nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, sick financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - the Der Standard in Vienna recalls that there are increasingly realistic concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers must go deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
"Savers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros soon, but it would be nice to record: in which case it is reasonable to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The flying of the bumblebee is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to prevent collisions, if not to imitate barrier sensors in the natural world?
Like bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebees gave the Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C type bioimitation car robot control system, a robotized minicar that was endowed with the properties of the bees, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the development of a system that eliminates all collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety shell, explained Kazuhhiro Doi, brand director of technology PR and research and development at the exhibition.
It is important to have a complex eye of the uterus, which can be seen at an angle of more than 300 degrees in each direction.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers touched the idea of laser telemetry.
This identifies obstacles in a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C within a 2 metre range, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an action to avoid collision.
The obstacle is detected in a fraction of a second, and then the car robot, mimicking the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid collision.
In any other way than the current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the Mobility Laboratory and car-robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety barrier, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
However, in a way other than bees, the deviation must not be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it must be only two-dimensional, and only towards the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibility for bees to avoid other bees, only rotating movement and acceleration and slowing were used here as an option available to the car robot.
BR23C employs lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life span than that of the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, the instinctive intelligent reaction is the important, not the ability to process and store data even less.
This device only has to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, thus constantly using only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in developing immediate bypass technology, which Nissan estimates can enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
An additional application option may be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to the specified end goal by avoiding obstacles on the road.
The priceless child has a name
A written version of the $700 billion Economic Rescue Package Act, applicable in several instalments to buy bad loans from banks, has been completed.
In the first round, half the amount is spent.
During further discussions on East Coast time until after midnight on Saturday, Congressional leaders reached a conclusion in the days-long debate around a total bailout package of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, who says that all that remains is to put the agreement on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Commenting on the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson stated that the programme will work and be effective, but that further work is needed. Pelosi says this is not about saving Wall Street, but turning the wagon around the economy.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening 8 p.m. (i.e. Monday morning, Central European time), but did not cause a spectacular run-up in the fairs.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote for the first time on the draft legislation under the name of the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008, which takes place on the programme, and then it will be on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night and was then welcomed to the White House for news of the settlement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesperson.
The program is otherwise different from the Bush administration's original proposal, which would have meant that the $700 billion would have been spent one-in-one on the purchase of poor quality, credit-backed securities.
Now, in the first round, a maximum of half of the $700 billion can be spent using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, from which the Treasury buys loans-backed, poorly rated securities, and the fate of an additional $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, which will also be involved with the President of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can take place in the framework of auctions and directly - the Ministry's competent authorities told us.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial portfolio guarantees the assets of concern for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means to reach up to $700 billion for the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is a widespread purchase of bad assets, or insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, the bosses of banks in distress and in need of state aid can expect to limit their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute, to be limited by the government.
Payments are limited only in certain cases and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys under auction, an extra tax will be levied on the gold parachute unless the devolved bank manager is retired.
When bad loans are purchased directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that executive money is not exaggerated.
The image includes that existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in American history that there will be a statutory restriction on the remuneration of CEOs, commented on the measure by the chairman of the House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services, Democratic Party Barney Frank.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire a stake, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately win the deal as soon as the economy and the bank that has been rescued recovers.
The draft law states that over the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal providing for how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, i.e. it does not protect taxpayers' dollars, said Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believed that the measures were called for by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, reports the KSH.
Industrial export sales prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of the domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than the previous year.
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to the 4.6 percent increase in the production of bags and straps and the 2.5 percent increase in the monthly price of footwear production.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical raw materials have resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the sectors of oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical machinery, instrument production (0.9 percent), and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which is significant in the domestic sales of the industry, increased by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the protracted impact of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
Twelve months' comparison, in terms of domestic sales of manufacturing industries, saw the largest increase in prices in the oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the manufacturing of metal processing products, an 11 percent increase in prices was observed in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors with a decisive weight of 13.2%.
Price reduction occurred in the textiles, textile goods production (2.5 percent) and electrical machinery and instrument production (0.3 percent) sectors.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
Prices have increased by 10.2 percent in the manufacturing industry as a whole over the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7 percent higher than those in the previous year.
Domestic sales showed the largest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in August in the capital goods manufacturing sectors of the target groups of the sectors.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, prices have increased by 0.3 percent and in the energy and downstream sectors have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in energy and downstream production sectors (16.8 per cent).
We measured a 6.8 percent increase in prices in consumer goods manufacturing sectors and a 1.4 percent decrease in prices in capital goods.
Export sales prices of the industry in HUF increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent in 12 months compared.
In a month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro and 7.1 percent compared to the dollar, with 7.5 percent compared to the euro compared to August 2007, and 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
Don't you need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, "it all depends now on whether the electronic access or control system is being built overseas in time".
However, he pointed out that there would be no admission permit in the new system, but that tourists would have to register before leaving.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington, D.C.
He meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom he is handed over by the Central Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary with the Star honors and talks with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain's foreign policy advisers.
The bank rescue package is supported by Barack Obama and McCain
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, secured support for the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, however, there is a politician who demands the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon negotiations, representatives of Congress and administration announced Sunday morning: they had reached a principled agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to defrost the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain appear to be more capable than his rival of leading the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, melting McCain's advantage, which he gained after the Republican convention, with Sarah Palin's nomination as vice president.
Obama expressed hope at a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection passages that he supported.
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) to your jobs, savings, industries as a whole, the stability of the whole economy is threatened," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC, "this will be difficult for all of us to swallow (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable way".
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a committee overseeing the Minister of Finance and limiting the severance pay for top executives, to which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the talks, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will hopefully vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The German Language Area Journal Review
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have the electorate become more self-conscious - so Der Spiegel analyses CSU's weak appearance in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (piegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Revolution of Bavaria, analyses the reasons for CSU's dramatic defeat in his article Eating His Fathers.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its office.
Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and these are the modern citizens who are turning away from them.
Change of era is also the problem of the whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising to CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely almost exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party ceased.
It has been ten years since CSU landed at 47.7 percent in 1998, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was still mentioned in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the systematic modernisation implemented by CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, it could not have been without consequences for the faithfulness of the electorate CSU to secularization, educational achievements, and the settlement of the East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have the electorate become more self-conscious, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks classical civic groups have been most distant from CSU; they are freelance, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
CSU's support has already shrunk to less than 40 percent here.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper "Who, Who? Party presidents deal with the confusing domestic political situation following the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to negotiate the coalition.
The election was made, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely allowed access to their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current ÖVP president as Vice-Chancellor - could be imagined - was left open by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was, in any case, voted down.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is, for the time being, fully open in the party, issues must necessarily be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has once again shown openness in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equal Opportunities Summit began today in Paris, hosted by France, representing the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, drew attention to educational segregation in her message to the plenum as one of the main speakers of the professional deliberations, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and this is also the most serious obstacle to their effectiveness.
The high-level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were invited to attend the deliberations.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to discrimination on recruitment, Roma are primarily excluded from the labour market due to their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and as a result of poor quality primary education, only an insignificant proportion of them can obtain higher education".
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of European Union Member States.
According to the Member, it is necessary to raise this awareness to the widest extent, including among Roma and non-Roma.
Because as soon as the Roma student starts school, their chances of becoming productive members of the labour market increase; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
"The Roma must have their right to quality education under the right of their citizenship of the European Union and guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the congresswoman, it is essential to bring together the European Union in an effort and action-oriented way to speed up the desegregation processes at school, and proper enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination guidelines is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, give Roma children the opportunity to contribute to Europe's future as full citizens", Járóka demanded.
The aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, is to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the debuted Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided
Despite the ugliness of the election, heads have not yet fallen, and the discussion of personal issues at the peaks of Bavarian CSU has been postponed for the time being.
Party President Erwin Huber and Provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in place, wondering how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem who suffers a 17 percent catastrophic vote loss will be decided by an extraordinary party convention during the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized pair have pointed out that they do not stick to their seats with all their strength.
By doing so, they sought to calm down the angry members of the faction and base, who demanded personal concenses over the loss of the absolute majority one day after the "Bajor tsunami".
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it only ran to 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, CSU was "unique" in Bavaria, accounting for 18 percent of German GDP.
While conservatives still count highly in the southern province of key importance for the Hungarian economy, they will definitely be forced into a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of reorganization within the party, Vice President Horst Seehofer, who is a potential successor to Huber, and Federal Agriculture Minister, will also be included in the narrow reconnaissance team that begins soft-slinging negotiations on a possible Munich government coalition with the Liberal FDP and Free electors organized along right-wing values.
The strange thing about fate is that the Gabriele Pauli whose action against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein pair as a coup opportunity on the Free electorate list and then harshly dealt with the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber, the former provincial head of government and former CSU president, has also called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
Huber on Monday let some epal notes to the CDU, he said they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as warning both to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election due in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor if the CSU, who played a significant role in the 2005 national success, is not somehow restored by joint force.
According to Merkel, who is hard to hide his disappointment over the fiasco, the soil loss of CSU will not negatively affect the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Of course, it is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to handle, and the crisis of social democrats will last longer.
SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria by 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko Opposition: 110–0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) it can be explained by the lawlessness committed at the count of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 100-ten-strong legislature of the country of 10 million lacked the opposition for many decades, prior to yesterday's elections, the opposition, united as the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his tenure as president for the fourth time in the 2006 elections of disputed purity, would this time "allow" the appearance of some opposition representatives in Parliament.
The ODSZ thus stopped the previously considered boycott.
The reason behind the opposition expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which borrowed to reduce the ever-priced Russian gas imports and also contributed to the delivery of Beltransgaz to Russian gas pipelines through the country - wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry permits due to the anti-democratic Belarusian political arrangements.
It indicated ex-ante relief that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, focused on positive moves rather than on shortcomings, such as banning a third of opposition candidates from leaving.
However, the OSCE's rapid report on Monday has already objected to the campaign - in which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Nevertheless, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political system is noticeable: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is also willing to have a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which has separated from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun, said Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that "power was frightened of letting even an opposition into the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to send a message to the electorate about the need for economic reforms.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles to their presentation, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, including among the elderly, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which regards the creation of social security as its main achievement, is not even considered appropriate by the officially most supported pensioners.
- Due to the country's indebtedness, the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time before the breakdown of social security, which evokes the silence of the cemetery, said Milinkevich.
As opposed to opposition politician, Russian observers have classified elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novostyi: "People believe not words but deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Morning only before working hours"
In the history of Chigi Palace, rotating doors have been installed for the entry and entry of workers in a unique way.
As of today, this new measure will come into effect against the craftsmen, to filter out those who block and then go out for coffee during working hours.
The anti-snatcher novelty was presented today by Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The rotating gates, Brunetta said, are for better and more efficient work, reducing absences and increasing services"
"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," Brunetta emphasized.
With the Chigi Palace, all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
Masi says "the installation of rotary gates is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
So we're done having breakfast at work, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta smiles and advises: "a good cappuccino at seven in the morning, capable of miracles"
At the College of Public Administration in Rome
At the meeting held, the Minister explained: "In three months, the shortages of public sector workers due to illness decreased by 50 percent, which means sixty thousand more people in one year".
However, he added that the Italian administration should be made more effective
, "which, according to the Minister, has been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8 to 10 years and has far exceeded the inflation rate".
At the same time, thousands of public servants gathered, joining the submission supported by the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Associations Organisation to protest the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Public Administration is boasting data supporting the reduction of sickness-related absences, the 'inexhaustible slackers' army is constantly growing," the consumer association writes.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff across Italy have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate provisions of the decree."
The regional administrative court is under attack, inter alia, the abolition of supplementary sickness benefits due to reasons of service, the extension of the stay of sick workers at home, which means the period within which the patient may appear and several other aspects contained in the new provisions imposed by the Minister.
Accidents at Work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, out of which 3 end in death and 27 end in permanent disability.
According to occupational accident insurance records, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today and is causing almost twice as many casualties as manslaughter.
Today, for the 58th time in all counties of Italy, Anmil is hosting the day of victims of accidents at work traditionally held on Sunday, October 2, to raise awareness of this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work," said President Giorgio Napolitano of the Republic in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association for Accidental Disability at Work.
The head of state sincerely praised the "confederation's persistent commitment to prevention at work, to protecting the interests of workers who have suffered accidents, to helping family members of victims and to raising public awareness".
"T tragedies of this nature and shared honestly by all, attracting media and public interest by their size, are a source of outrage, but in reality we have to face dramatic, repeated cases every day".
Napolitano openly admits: "we are undoubtedly in a shortage of resources, funding education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at providing direct information to young people on the threshold of entry into the world of work are of particular importance.
We have a duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to let it become less noticeable about the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
The President of the House of Commons Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed "how serious accidents at work ending in death are of social importance to all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible".
"Data on accidents at work shows a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this type is still incredibly high," commented Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We do not want this downward trend, however, to be coupled with decreasing attention, because the greatest tragedies occur just when attention is slowed down."
"We believe that at a general level we are still not doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, we need more stringent supervision and control - stressed Mercandelli - as well as a more marked intervention in the field of labour training, starting from school education."
"There is also a need for further efforts to inform and make public opinion aware," he added.
However, what is most needed is a more responsible employers' environment against a phenomenon that poses a social problem".
Afterwards, Mercandelli criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation safety net for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid trend towards which the system has been drifting in recent years".
"The goal, therefore, is to return to workers the safety afforded by insurance, because the fate of those suffering an accident cannot depend on the arbitrary actions of the legislators, or on the handout measures".
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Listening to portable recording devices for longer periods of time and at high volume, such as MP3 devices, can cause permanent hearing loss -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), has published today’s opinion.
"The expert opinion shows that 5-10 percent of those who listen to their portable music player for more than one hour per day for five years with a high volume can suffer permanent hearing loss," says the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones in bulk and often are unaware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk that we urgently need to respond to," added the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information about this.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can function and keep pace with the latest technologies".
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to look at the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise pollution caused by them.
"Researchers confirm that we have cause for concern and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to look at possible measures to protect children and minors exposed to noise pollution caused by portable players and similar devices," said a member of the Committee.
The current European safety requirement sets the maximum noise level that can be emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, but is nevertheless accompanied by growing concern about hearing loss data due to excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing damage.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for mobile players who listen to music at a high volume (over 89 decibels) for five hours per week, noise pollution exceeds the current maximum noise limit for the workplace.
If a person listens to music in similar circumstances for a longer period of time, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5-10 percent of those using portable devices, which can mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, it lasts until March, the results are expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the operation of the committee "The future of the seat capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the committee will draw up Rome's guidelines.
Following the conclusion in March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and municipal committee so that the Metropolitan strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno can be submitted in June.
"This is an entirely independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - and Alemmanno stresses - it is in his task to come up with proposals for the development ideas of Rome on which policy makers, the Assembly and the Local Government Committee, can rely.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after he has completed his work, the committee will be dissolved because he has a fixed term of office.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of Rome, the mayor said.
For those who consider the Commission's operation unnecessary, on the grounds that the advice it has put forward is not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on what work the Commission will do and on the quality of proposals it will put on the table.
If the quality is satisfactory, as is the case with the Attali Committee in France, which I take for granted in the case of Rome, its contribution will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in dealing with daily affairs and in dealing with urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we, taking into account perspectives, look further and plan for a longer term and are committed to working for the development and future of Rome".
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless "waterhead", as it is absolutely free, will not cost any euro to the citizens of Rome, but on the other hand it serves as a thought incentive and aims to involve the finest minds in the capital".
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump to the standard it needs so much, thinking in a united spirit about its future".
About the future on which the mayor of Rome emphasises: "it will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but it will look much further", not only will we see the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also "the role it can and must play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician claiming to be independent wrote of this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions destroyed the American economy and had close relations (as he does today as a private person) with enemy Islam".
As the election date approaches, the attacks on Obama are increasing.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet, "This man is full of ambition.
Obama insolently believes he can win the highest public-law dignity of a nation whose total of two governors and five senators have been black so far!"
These attacks are in fact meaningless; they are of course racist in nature, but do not answer the voter's question of whether he will be a good president. Then there are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant priority.
Even in this case, there are those who listen to their emotions and not their minds.
Inside the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its editorial: we know well that the true American patriot in the voting cabin casts his vote for whom.
A side of American thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk whatever you want, we'll know where to put the icse, on Obama or McCain".
Some people swear by it: if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these cleverness, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked about the mistakes made during Bush's tenure? 89 percent replied that Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they kicked it so hard, it flew home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans did not have to pack.
Yet the majority believe that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
A great task awaits the one who replaces George W.
USA: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time for cuts has come in the newsrooms. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked five hundred American journalists how they felt about the future situation and spiritual power of their profession.
Well, at the moment, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not clearly claim that their concerns about authenticity had been reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as before.
The problem with American journalists is money.
According to them, the 2008 crisis is the failure of a powerless economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on the newsroom, or newspaper editors.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense of what the high public understands by this, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved, the journalists asked say.
Nowadays, American journalism is characterized by a clearly visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top executives working in the print press are convinced that national jurnalistics are on the wrong track.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior leadership positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
Press staff have no difficulty seeing where the World Wide Web is going.
The biggest publishers make their way to the Internet, which is believed by many to be the "killer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they would vote for the technology, in the hope that it might benefit from jurnalistics.
Today, there is a gap in the American press industry between editorial leaders, or directors, and correspondents working for them.
At national level, 56 percent of the leaders are confident that their correspondents will share their information with others, while at local level this figure is only 23 percent.
Some associate this with a secure job.
At national level, 47 percent of the leaders fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of "sure work" is constantly on the agenda at team level (in the case of our editors, ed.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a huge nation like the United States with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a "need or not" basis.
Principals usually receive high salaries, and editors can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to paying pensions and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, operates on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x day, in the third, too, until after a certain time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own admissions, often "get sick" during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIAN COURT: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, the President of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Rome, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, who was active in the real estate profession, who wanted to go from his residence, Grottaferrata, to a Roman flat.
Coppola is being investigated for economic failure in the context of an investigation into the Unipol - BNL stock exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings initiated against him, the house arrest was lifted and changed to the residence ban on Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional be allowed to pass from the rural small town to his capital apartment.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor made a negative proposal) would allow the company's affairs to be influenced and accessed by the evidence brought up against it.
The Elite Is in Danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion bailout package presented by the White House: much of the Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that due to the current crisis, there has been a break within the Republican Party, which is increasingly divisive between a traditional, subdued attitude to the east coast supporting federal institutions and business circles and a growing anti-D.C. and financial world stance in the central and southern states.
This line was critically manifested during the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is just one of the major changes that the economic reshuffle that is still taking place predicts or permits to be seen, and not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, perhaps even outside.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only speeding up the long-standing underlying phenomena that are solidifying in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is re-updating, bringing back to the public a dual category of state sovereignty, in connection with a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is affecting banking and financial institutions which, although they have a close relationship with the rest of the world, are primarily, and quite widely, bringing people and families with them that live in a single country, in a single state.
This, on the other hand, is a direct political problem for those on the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also electorate.
So the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially stranded outside the coastline: the European Union is a fine proof of this, which, by lavishing between different interests and different national strategies, cannot set a single policy stance.
Thus, everyone expects intervention from individual national governments, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but most importantly the opening of funds: as only individual states have economic resources, a financial set that may be able to make things right.
They also have the means and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organisation will likely ever have to this extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on national statehood is fully in line with the fact that recent economic growth attaches increasing importance to a factor closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were less and less abstract than water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, yet are wholly linked to a demarcated location, an area.
Thus, whoever rules the area has much more trump cards than, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
I would like to move on to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Anyone who says it's territory, state, government necessarily says it's politics, in other words leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to be producing two contiguous phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can handle events.
On the other hand, current management, especially economic leaders, brings a complete loss of credit, who have proved to be completely inadequate and have proved that many are still in dim territory before them.
Together, the two are of even deeper importance and, in a sense, more disturbing: a sense of credit loss, impatience, inadequacy, and separation that affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that the belief that the time of the social elite at its peak has expired is spreading among a wider population. It expired before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, culture, in the complex sense of the word, were taken into their own. This makes the social elite increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In other words, the need for leadership, in a veiled form, is fueling a diverse but strong delegitimation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is manifested in unanticipated "rebellions" by voters, or in recent times in sudden changes in public sentiment. For example, the rise of Conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Unit in Britain, or the revolt of U.S. Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, along with its parties, programs, and even its famous intellectuals, understands less and less, and therefore is less and less able to represent what has been happening for some time in the deeper sections of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is getting stronger, spreading and potentially able to generate increasingly inordinate emotions.
Despite all this, talking about "the imminent rebellion of the masses" would be an exaggeration, to be honest.
But keeping your eyes open isn't bad at all.
We can walk with super powerful glue on the wall
By using a super-powerful glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This is the goal set out by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions are close to finding a solution.
With a piece of glue of just 2.5 square centimetres, researchers managed to glue a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and hold it there.
THE American journal STUDY - A Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the further development of special carbon nanotube materials that existed before.
"The principle of adhesive operation must be imagined as a pipe system similar to a package of spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Researchers drew the idea from the foot covered with gecko microscopic folds, which provides perfect grip for the animal.
Tests with various materials such as glass, Teflon, and abrasive paper have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the soles of those reptiles, but at the same time "it is easily detached from the wall", Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering faculty of the University of Dayton, explains.
FALON TO GO? - "This material may be useful as temporary glue," Liming Dai adds.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good at driving heat and electricity.
You can also find additional applications in the field of space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
OTHER RESEARCH - the University of California Berkeley is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in American Chemical Society, California scientists have presented a hair-like, microfiber adhesive that undergoes self-cleaning during movement on the surface, thus always providing perfect adhesion.
Don't use juice.
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high vitamin-containing drinks, especially popular in the summer, when added with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or reducing their effects, as appropriate. This may also have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, drew attention to the risks of co-administration of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines. The professor announced at the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the patient’s health.
Grapefruit juice had already been placed on the defendants' bench when it was discovered that it was able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rhythm control, and neuropharmaceuticals to levels considered toxic.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in its official bulletin and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-administration and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadon.
GRAPEFRUIT alone - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances whose absorption is hindered by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at Milan State University, draws attention to: "This kind of discovery is usually immediately signalled to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutions, who, if necessary, ensure that the information contained in the prospectus of the given product is changed.
This is why you should always read the instructions for the medicine you intend to take, and if something is not understood, do not let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly," emphasized Ansa.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics, for analysing the territorial contexts of commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most hot critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy actions.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more fateful consequences for United States history than the collapse of twin towers.
This prediction sparked a lot of controversy, and it was repeatedly thrown at the economist's eyes, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm also a little shocked by how quickly public interest over the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has moved on," Krugman said in late 2002.
A member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank according to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Krugman is a "rupt value economist" but at the same time spreads his criticisms of Bush government's excessive liberalism in a rather aggressive style."
Open Office, third edition worth the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today, the OpenOffice.org 3.0-personal productivity-enhancing open program code application package is released, targeting ever wider layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from freelancers to public administration.
After almost a year of work supervised by SUN Microsystem and carried out by volunteer developers, the new Open Office comes to the public with several new features: in addition to the welcome screen and the rethought, less Spartan user interface, it offers several essential innovations, such as compatibility with Apple Mac OS X operational systems, and also supports the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting is the specific function of a few modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful for sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphics module by retaining the page location layout.
On the same interface, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also been through a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting each other's works. Each employee's comment is marked in a different color, which helps easier recognizability during the inspection phase.
Some companies are already working to make some of OpenOffice's features available from the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from the following address after it has been posted on the mirror pages to English since Friday: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operational systems.
On request, we can take the installation CD at home or at work.
Freeness is probably the biggest attraction for the spread of home application, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of educational, advisory and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business perspectives.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, text editor for Word; Calc, spreadsheet manager for replacing Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the best known, similar to Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphics module.
The goal of 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads. However, considering that with the release of the new version we are already at 3.600,000, this figure will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive. This is the fourth doping case.
In the last stage of the Tour de France, a positive pattern was again produced by one of the participants, Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the Gerolsteiner team, who won the top mountaineer shirt in addition to the bronze medal.
The news came out on the Equipe Internet newspaper site.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, as well as German, also Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test considered the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like tests carried out in recent weeks, has been investigated by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be banned from racing for two years according to regulations.
The news of the positive result of Kohl's third generation EPO test was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and announced to the Associated Press news agency: he indicated a positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, as well as winning the dot shirt for the best mountaineer.
DO THE NEW YORK TIMES ASK THE QUESTION, ITALY'S RASSIST?
From Italy's emigrating country, it has only recently become one of the preferred destinations for reluctant immigrants.
Because of this, the "Belpaese" is transformed into a racist nation? This question is asked by the New York Times, which, based on the case of Abdul William Guibre of young Burkina Faso - who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits - devotes a long article to the controversy over racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the "north paradox": in the northern regions, the "strongest integration and highest employment" at the same time is the "anti-immigrantism and support for the Northern League "is also the strongest here in the country.
In support of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also cites cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins on immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, have also been discussed as an example of a change of mood in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI in the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the state and Church work together to overcome racism".
Students are suffering from expensive rents, up to 900 euros a room
The market for accommodation for college students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, Housing Union, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such amazing proportions that, due to the enormous overall costs for families, it excludes a wide range of students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia's study office. "In these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general process of expensiveness has also started towards local residents."
In most cases, real estate properties also contain a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rent restrictions, with associated sublets.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to maximise prices through the revision of the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, 450 euros are also requested for a bed; the price of the single room ranges from 650 Euros (around Bande Nere) to 800 Euros ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) on average, but can reach 900 Euros (around Vittoria).
A bed space in Florence costs an average of EUR 350/400, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where most of the students live in the neighborhood close to the university, a bed space costs €250/280 when it comes to double and €370-500 when it comes to single rooms.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single person and 450 for a double room bed.
Prices are slightly cheaper (550 euros for a single room) around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Some can be saved in suburban districts: one bed costs 300 euros and 450 single rooms in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. Price is highest in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, one bed is paid EUR 250/350 and at least 350 for one single room.
Prices in smaller cities are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU often seek accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the days of old cinema halls are over in the cities
Traditional cinemas close for Multiplexes.
"A city where there are no cinemas, blind town, is like a face without eyes".
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively show what is happening in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the emergence of large multi-room cinemas in the suburbs, and as a result the withering of single-rooms in city centres - seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time bears all the features of a true cultural crime.
When historical and memorable places disappear, "it's like a friend of ours is leaving, a familiar with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which twenty years ago marked the Oscar Award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival to Tornatore, tells the lyrical history of a small town cinema, the yearning, after a cinema experience that may have been lost forever.
The data provided by Anec, the largest association of operators, is clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The biggest losses have been recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin, and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is at the forefront of the most affected regions, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the fact that the expansion of multiplexes is the only evidence of their disappearance is that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years the number of halls has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It's okay to build new facilities, but the survival of those already in existence should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not every passer-by is willing to cross over into multiplexes.
Not to mention the unpaid financial funds to support operators: the state's overdue debt is around EUR 10 million.
It is both ethically and morally shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
To maintain the market would require EUR 16-18 million per year".
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. It is the first Italian city to decide, in its concern over the closures, to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost single-room cinemas in both the city and downtown.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted zones and park at preferential tariffs in certain parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow Bologna's example.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the domination of multiplexes, need to improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that eventually made Cinema Paradiso, although I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or the Quirinale so I don't see the posters blackened by dust, I turn my head.
Close ties between politics and the 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro was arrested
"Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported Piromalli clan interests in municipal decisions".
Serious accusations were made against the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal conspiracy.
Cuffs were also placed on the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior intermediary between the clan and administration, and a lawyer nephew of the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a mafia-like crime syndicate and was charged with €10 million in compensation.
"The disregard for any legal and moral rules, even good taste", states the state's attorneys. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay an advisory fee to lawyer Piromalli.
"So the clan would have officially had access to the town hall, which would have given further opportunity to control and control the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the General Assembly of the Calabria region, does not hide that there is "a number of collusion between local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean".
The arrests this morning are a follow-up to the events of July, when police announced that they had managed to decapitate the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee had already been dissolved once in 1991, still due to suspected mergers between organized crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor reigning at the dissolution, was placed at the head of the centre-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried scandal when County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He brought Marco Minnini to court and accused him of planning everything with a political agenda. However, in the arrest order signed this morning, the court explained that the Piromalli clan had ventured to demand a change in the A3 project.
The wiretap ordered against Dal Torrione reveals, writes the state's attorneys, that "it was inclined to meet the demands of an extensive entrepreneur representing a group known to be close to the Piromall family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to clan interest."
The energy is coming from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface and is still being discovered by large international energy companies
Waves, sea currents, tides, all renewable energy sources that have been sighted by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on it.
For a hundred years, they have been looking for ways to get energy from the motions of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
Around 1980, when oil prices decreased, the idea of using marine energy was put aside, but today the demand for environmental protection and the rise in oil prices are giving the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council of London (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity demand could be covered by facilities exploiting sea surges.
This quantity is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
Besides that, there would still be currents and tides.
The giants are swinging.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be established in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are voting for marine energy, including those who have been committed supporters of traditional energy so far.
"Chevron is studying technologies exploiting the energy of the oceans and is considering the possibility of cooperating with us," stated Wall Street Journal, a spokesperson for an associated venture of the American oil giant.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the licence required by the US Energy Commission to launch the offshore energy project in Alaska.
This is not of little importance, especially considering that the US is currently extracting oil in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York City and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the road to extractable energy from the sea.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, it is still a primitive technology, even because the energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
Existing facilities such as Portugal or Scotland are all small and therefore do not cause much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce more energy on a larger scale, we need facilities with a more significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a interconnected buoy system.
Pushes generated by the waves and moving buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure turns a turbine, which feeds a generator.
Electricity travels to land on cables under the sea.
For the time being, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are waiting for federal approval, some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started power generation for a shopping mall and a parking lot with the help of six underwater turbines located in the East River Strait in New York City.
At tide, the movement of water turns the blades of turbines, and this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said that it has a long list of partners who are just waiting for permits to use energy.
It's tidal after waves.
At present, there is a need for particular attention to be paid to the opportunities that can be exploited by tides.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, tidal tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be considered a more reliable energy source.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008, just to exploit the energy supplied by tides, which is projected to increase to $35 million in 2009.
