European inflation has slipped on food
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The increase in prices in November was higher than expected in 13 countries of the euro area, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, the EU's statistical office in Luxembourg reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base rate, saying that the reduction, along with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment, would lead to the development of an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep inflation rates below and close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is trapped in the trap of twenty-two: "we need to talk down" inflation so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the figure of November inflation is 3.3 percent as a twelve-year record; and in Spain it rose to 4.1 from 3.6.
Euro area inflation has been driven high by rising food and energy prices.
Futures wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and soybean exchange rates have also reached the highest since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price of oil has increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5 percent this year in 2008, but it will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
Analysts say that the 12-month inflation rate will remain at around 3 per cent over the next 3-4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to have twice lowered interest rates in 2008.
The Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support circle increased significantly by early December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such a low 13 percent socialist support.
The difference between certain party electorates - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent over two-thirds (71 percent) of support against one-fifth (20 percent) support from the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SDS are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the total population is two percent.
Among the sure voting party electorates, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic sentiment has deteriorated further to the previous low - there has never been such a high percentage, 41 percent of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly bad, while another 46 percent say it is quite bad.
Families now judge the change in their own financial situation more pessimisticly after spring and summer hopes.
For the following year, the larger half of the population expect further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than any previous survey of Gallup, 71 percent of those polled believed that the Prime Minister was doing his job wrong rather than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or trust very much, while Viktor Orbán has a 38 percent share of supporters.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all, 27 percent do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of political development is how much of society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be treated without a change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 percent considered the government and the head of government to remain desirable, at present this rate is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees only the solution in issuing new elections.
Typically, interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of those polled answer the question asking the intent to participate, that they would surely go away, and another 20 percent say they would probably go away.
As a comparison, only 55 percent would take part in a "this Sunday's parliamentary election" and an additional 15 percent would consider it likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be in question on the basis of the current intentions.
For tuition fees, 74 people, 79 for visitation fees, and 84 percent for hospital daily fees would say no.
If we look at the same rates only among those who promise to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visits and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive is the Auchan, raised nearly a fifth by Tesco
In the trade triangle of Budaörs, hypermarkets held last year's average price level increase of 16 percent, except that VAT did not rise this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
This year, on average, the Daily's usual Christmas basket in the trade triangle of Budaörs increased by 16 percent, but each hypermarket showed an increase in value well above a thousand forints.
Since last December prices in grocery stores had gone "out" so there was no drastic price increase compared to the previous high base.
Obviously, however, it is frightening for consumers that what they could have received last year under nine thousand forints, they are not getting it for even ten thousand dollars.
The Daily basket crossed the ten thousand HUF psychological limit by at least HUF 91 in the hypermarkets examined.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003 the basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the turkey breast fillet, nuts and poppy trees were also highly expensive.
The price of flour and bread followed KSH's data in the shops, although we found one kilogram of bread in Auchan for HUF 139.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this business that the two-litre refundable bottle Coca-Cola price was less than 200 HUF, so only 257 HUF was requested for the product along with a deposit fee.
However, this year Auchan appeared in the Daily basket to be the most expensive, while Cora appeared to be the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased prices by 15 percent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices in their Daily basket by about 18-18 percent.
Compared with last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive, the increase was 21 percent.
On average, there was an increase of 1480 in Forint.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1,206, with the VAT increase affecting prices last Christmas.
This is precisely the process that has disrupted trade, and it is not apparent that stores were able to decide what margin to apply to a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the speed of rotation of a product is poorly planned by the trader, it may lose a significant profit in the margin adjusted for traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the Daily basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive HUF 1720 was more than the value of 2006, while the price difference was only HUF 844 at the cheapest.
This year, this extreme was not manifested, since the most expensive one was HUF 1630 more than last year, and the cheapest one was also HUF 1284 more expensive.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a disastrous price increase, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increasing by over 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily justify the data of the CSO: for some basic foods, the statistical office has a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
For example, in addition to flour, it is also in the egg.)
According to the Daily Cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, produced a price increase of just over 10 percent in the worst case scenario compared to the base.
The flour suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than the eggmen, with drastic price level increases also being fooled by the multis.
In the commercial gold triangle, hyperes do not complain, they keep reporting a good year.
In our experience, the majority of customers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantities of everything, they carry durable foods on a flatbed.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed serious lines in front of the counters because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, it is believed that traffic in the countryside is poorer, with several multi complaints to research companies that even its plans are falling short of revenue, not only in the case of food but also in the case of durable consumer products.
In many places, disinfectants are used to save money
This year, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the crowded beds, the overload of staff do not favor stopping infections, says head of department at the National Center for Epidemiology.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
There was a recent diagnosis of MRSA infection in the traumatology department at John's Hospital.
An antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man admitted after a major accident.
The patient's been isolated.
A similar infection occurred here at the beginning of the same year.
A serious car accident victim was released from the hospital, however, shortly after he had to return with MRSA infection, and an important surgery he had never been able to perform since was due to the bacteria in his body.
By 10 December this year, 1,094 hospitalized infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Chief Medical Officer at the National Center for Epidemiology, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens are definitely registered in hospitals, the rest is unknown.
About two thirds (683 infections) of the infections were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inadequately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop very resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently malfunctioning, it may cause serious hospital infections such as wound infection or sepsis in patients with a weakened body, elderly or low body weight.
According to the director of medicine at John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the disease, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Resisting Antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, nursing staff provide the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital will be examined in advance to see if they have MRSA in their system, but still cannot avoid infection at all times.
Sampling is not a fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable for preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection typically occurs in hospitals, elderly homes, hospitals should check patients entering and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in this that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these investigations.
Most cases are thus brought to light when the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, said the chief of staff at the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicinal products, but hospitals do not always comply with this.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, said Böröcz Karolina.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another through the mediation of healthcare personnel.
Therefore, washing hands, using gloves, masks, has a major role to play, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by drop infection and contact, but in domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the wards are often crowded, often very close to each other, even though patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart from each other from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also evident that Böröcz Karolina noted that in hospitals in poor financial conditions, disinfectants are being saved, there are few nurses, many patients, so there is an even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are observed, there is less evidence of such infection or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Managing MRSA infection causes huge costs to health insurance companies, so they fight it everywhere.
In England, for example, it included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA in the government programme.
The programme appears to be successful, with MRSA infections showing a decreasing trend in England based on the reported data.
Among the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) are the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospitalised infections caused by these pathogens.
No drunk police commissioner responsible for the fatal accident
A formal expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the XXII District Police Commissioner has been prepared.
It can be ruled out that he would have led his post drunk or intoxicated in the meantime resigned XXII District Police Commissioner, who ran a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, was informed by Attila Morvai, spokesperson for the Metropolitan Attorney General's Office on Friday after the expert opinion on this was completed.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which had already found that the former police commissioner had not consumed alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
The then leader of the XXII district precinct hit a 55-year-old man who was not trying to cross the road at the designated foot crossing on Tuesday during a turn on Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not pass through the zebra, is not otherwise a mitigating circumstance under the regulations of the KREZ, the turn-over driver must still give priority.)
The pedestrian was killed following transport to the hospital.
Due to what happened, the district police chief resigned his post and requested his retirement, according to police announcement, because he was so shaken by the incident.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the case.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police commissioner had collaborated with the investigating prosecutors from the beginning.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
Three credit lines in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy have been signed by János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million envelope in 2006 for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, of which EUR 100 million has already been concluded by the parties, and the contract now signed is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also serves to finance education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million could be used later by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract, which is mainly used by the budget for the University of Debrecen's research and development project.
The meeting also mentioned Metro 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how the original treaty should be amended.
According to János Veres, this could take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans is provided by the EIB with an 8-year grace period and without any maintenance commission linked to EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the EU property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - all of Europe's attention is focused on the previously little mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's cheapest but rapidly expensive market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The most popular real estate purchase destination in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa areas, and on the coast are Albena, "Golden Coast", "Napospart", ancient Sozopol and Tsabar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will be interested in investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will also buy around the extremely cheap Rus.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces promising the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golf havens, making it a priority destination for the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foreseeing investors are therefore already buying largely, such as in the Bansko area.
Analysts say that the buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers either buy renovated properties at a price of between €50 and €100,000, or run-down old houses for €5-15,000, and then refurbish them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, they care about the proximity of a big city, shops and local doctors in general.
The second category is for holiday buyers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who purchase in the hope of medium or long-term value gains.
The increase in capital real estate is continuous, as demand is growing.
In the European Union, housing prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but they have increased by 21 percent per year over the past five years.
The increase in house prices is essentially above the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
According to Mr Fodor, the meetings of experts will be completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening ceremony, the negotiations of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At present, this is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently intend to negotiate exact numbers, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 state.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries undertake to provide both financial and technological assistance to countries in need, in addition to reducing emissions.
There has also been an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The grant fund, as provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected to be within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), can be found in the Market and Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Mr Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role as a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the "Convention after 2012" and that it is prepared to reduce up to 30 percent if other major developed regions in the world and developing countries are willing to commit to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 percent, including the EU - 15 Member States at the time - undertook a minus 8 percent reduction.
The Hungarian obligation is 6 percent greenhouse gas emission reduction compared to the 1985-87 period, which Hungary will fulfil. - recalls the Ministry of the Environment press release.
The stakes in Bali are high, as the long-term international climate agreement needs to be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, which the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Panel on Climate Change, has also pointed out in its latest report.
This would delay emissions reduction and make it inevitable to increase Earth's average temperature above 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
Video-sharing footage of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan is published by British Army units to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to receive YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These footage taken with miniature helmet-mounted cameras is checked at Air Force Operation Command in Kandahar and then sent to London, where domestics upload them to the Internet.
The Political Message Is Inescapable
139 footage has already been uploaded to the Internet by Air Force soldiers in this form, and their "channel" has been viewed by over 75,000.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of actions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channel.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended to post the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to inform the general public of the true purpose of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional televised recruitment advertisements, said defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but it also inevitably carries some political message, as it confirms the existence of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans made a game.
In addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also on the divider, which, for example, display the death of soldiers: in slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers speak only of losses, but do not present the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, many videos from the Iraqi and Afghanistan battlefield have been released onto the Internet in live missions, but the British army has only recently received them.
The Americans are recruiting in a slightly different way, with the free downloadable shooting game America's Army, in which the player can go straight into the soldiers' skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
It's going to be a scribble and scribble Christmas at the Ministry.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who will be able to thank her with scones and coffee from 2007.
There is a ministry where there will be a live music party, elsewhere raffle raffle and toast a Christmas atmosphere into the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so enjoy the power.
The state offices are getting ready for Christmas.
The biggest-cut Ministry Christmas party is held by the defense wallet this year, but HM is not waiting for the Ministry workers.
At Orphan Christmas, children of fallen soldiers receive gifts, and family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are hosted at Mission Christmas, but a press reception is also held.
The wallet is dedicated $25 million for the year-end atmosphere.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) are off the hook compared to other wallets.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, with a total of HUF 4,330,000, and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected of the six hundred Ministries.
They'll stick to the Christmas spirit at the wallet ceremony, but there'll be performers and raffle.
Christmas of the NFU cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held at the National Council of Justice (OIT) building on Wednesday - there were concerts and dinner.
The room rent cost one million HUF, and the remainder was spent on more than 400 guests.
One of the departments of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
For the purpose, the building of the Comfort Theatre was rented.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt. as we failed to reach the person responsible.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which held a Luca Day ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask for money from them for the use of the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's toast, and after dinner it was possible to dance to live music.
The [origo] question was stated: the evening dress or suit was not mandatory at the ball at all.
Puritan party is arranged for the health, labor and municipal wallet.
The Ministry of Health organizes a show and ceremony for employees in its own building for HUF 400,000.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, is not officially waiting for a Christmas party, but for an end-of-year workshop.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to receive only coffee and scones, so the party will be brought out of 350,000 HUF.
On the other hand, Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai will simply toast with his colleagues in the aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) hosts a Christmas gathering in its own main hall, for which 436 workers are expected.
2,500 HUF per guest is intended for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since John Veres is the minister, PM employees have been doing the same thing every year.
However, there will be no party atmosphere, officiality is strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon's date.
The agriculture portfolio will give a New Year's reception on January 20, and ministry Christmas is cancelled.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, Városliget, and according to the statement of the portfolio, 1000 HUF is intended each for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, which is only official for foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a short ministerial toast and end with a subdued snack.
There is no Christmas party at all at the State Department and the Ministry of Education and Culture - they told [origo] in the relevant press departments.
The price of the office Christmas of the environmental portfolio could not be determined in the press department.
At any rate, more than 400 people were invited to the party, which is held at the Museum of Applied Artists.
Powers of the Giant Strike Growing
On Friday, their strike committee, coordinating an indefinite strike on Monday, will be formed by the League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Councils.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the cessation of work will begin.
The action will surely cause a major disruption in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and will also be on strike at the BKV for 13:00.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will present details of their Monday strike organised jointly with the National Federation of Labour Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday the organizations joining the strike will cease work indefinitely if they cannot reach agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been marked - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date of the end of the strike that has begun.
If the Parliament does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
Based on the agenda of the Parliament on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted in late-night or possibly night hours.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions in transport can be expected: work is stopped at the railways for an indefinite period, and in the morning some of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volán companies, can stop.
At the same time, there will also be a semi-track roadblock at many points in the country.
A number of unions and NGOs joined the strike call, and their list is constantly updated on the League's month.
Some organizations have signaled a strike indefinitely, and others have declared temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, even though more and more are travelling by rail as Christmas holidays approach.
According to previous reports, they are on strike from the start of operation until 13:00 at BKV, Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., a four-hour strike is being held by the LIGA Electricity and Heat Trade Unions, 2 and 8 hours of work was called upon by the Union of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationally, at different times, and the Democratic Union of Workers (EDDSZ) is holding a two-hour warning strike in the Health and Social Sector of the SEF.
Most importantly, the four demands made by the League are that the government withdraw its proposal for health insurance reform and issue a new concept for social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce a new way of calculating pensions from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement is able to be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZ) of the League Trade Union does not accept the Ministry of Economics and Transport's offer of rail wing lines, expecting a different offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
Founded in August of this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement, the Hungarian Guard has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects according to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division).
In its "risk warning" the company wrote: the biggest political risk of the Hungarian Guard's activities is that "with the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, even violent ethnic clashes can develop in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this is due to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: "the public discussion of the Roma issue was passed on by public actors to representatives of radical and extremist political groupings who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts occurring, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have caused great domestic and international media attention to "significantly impair the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability and democratic development of the country".
It is recalled that from the autumn of 2006, it was part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary that from the summer of 2007, several organizations called themselves "national self-defense" associations were formed in Hungary.
"The common feature of these groupings is to define themselves as a civil society organization while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members, whether armed, for defence (disaster defense, defence, law enforcement) tasks, and in addition to citing the inadequacy of the police, the military, or the state," they added.
They noted that all this is done in accordance with the method of putting various political aspirations in civil robes based on the anti-political and partyism of society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association therefore serves not only to avoid legal pitfalls in court registration for these associations, but also as a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies by reference to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
As they wrote, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is backed by the mass Roma riots that broke out in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
BNU took advantage of this to decide on the formation of the guard, saying that the organization's goal was "national self-defense".
In the past 17 years, they believe that there has been a "gypsy terrorist" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained idle and indifferent - the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they wrote, an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that they are creating their own guard as resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary respond to the threat similarly by organising their own self-defense, as stated in the Risk Warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital said that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they release their risk analysis annually, and if they experience anything that may affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
It's not all red-letter holidays.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and around the holidays working day restructuring has become a common practice, of which there will be less next year.
It is not a united holiday in the EU and in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are mostly linked to church holidays, illustrious historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the Old Year and the new first day are both a public holiday - the latter also so that New Year's Evers can relax.
We have 11 red-letter holidays all year round, by the way.
National holiday is also the Memorial Day of March 15 and October 23 commemorating the Revolution of 1848, the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the establishment of the state, on 1 May we celebrate the work, and on 1 and 2 November we remember our relatives and friends who died.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are a two - day holiday.
Since our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall for the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to relocate working days in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the cost of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work school on previous Saturdays.
The exact date on which the day immediately before or after the holiday should be worked has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation covers all employers and workers employed by them, both civil servants and those in public service relations.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on public holidays as a result of its purpose.
This year it is only around the end-of-year holidays that the working schedule changes: from 24 December, life almost stops in the country, as according to the experience, the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slipped down" by the majority of people, or use their saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, we will have more holidays in the middle of the week and at the end of the week, so there will be less work day relocation than there will be this year.
First, the calendar changes around the celebration of work, so that workers can stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day in exchange for Friday, May 2nd.
The other transfer relates to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24th.
However, the end of the year can be fully celebrated next year, as almost everywhere from 24 December a nonstop break will take place even if New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six daunting things to piss off your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemail messages that we never get, innocent lies that we almost don't even notice anymore: they "color" everyday life at work.
The question is, do you get used to small inconveniences or put on gloves and consciously avoid confusing situations that cause annoyance to others?
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you about the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting because of that?
At best, he regrets and tries to make amends, possibly calling the marketing department to say he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less conventional solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before an awkward apology is made, it is worth considering what it is that you can get unpleasant minutes for your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid that.
You're borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than you reaching for a document, office supplies, or your phone, and it's nowhere to be found.
Remember yesterday, you put your stapler on the table, but by morning, he was feet up?
Perhaps you'll discover on one of your colleagues' desks the pen you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they're right to be mad at you for horsebacking their property.
Don't pocket the office envelopes, post-it, 'cause it can't be comfortable if it runs out prematurely, and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about colleagues' personal lives?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not tie your information (conditions) on the privacy of your colleagues to everyone!
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, don't abuse his trust.
Bury what you have heard, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even if others know about your colleague’s dealings.
You're just gonna call in sick?
When you call in to the office and call in sick on the grounds of a splitting headache, because you feel unwell or that day you would rather rest; think of your work, your indefatigable tasks, your futures work, having to be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won't be going into the office the next day, or if there's something you need to stay home for, you should tell your colleagues and boss not to face your absence the next day.
Whispering, giggling, making phone calls
You're getting into work, but you're getting pulled out of it by your colleagues' giggling?
Unwittingly, did you witness a telephone conversation that would have been better left unheard of?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, singing, talking loudly (which you carry on over their heads), or by drumming feet, constantly swearing, and loud dissatisfaction.
These can all be confusing, even if they are not getting into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If you don't have time for something, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, and don't blame someone else for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the chaos that may prevail in the office, your loud colleagues.
Admit it, if you made a mistake, and it's got someone else's downside, and get rid of it.
Ask him how you can make up for your mistake, make up for the omission.
Are you feeling too at home in the office?
Bear shorts and slippers: comfortable wear for home, but not for office!
Don't wear comfortable leisure clothes even if you're allowed to do your job.
Don't be sleazy, your colleagues, and honor yourself by wearing ordinary clothes - if your job requires you to go into the office handsomely, elegantly!
If you want to live up to it, you're no longer interesting.
Sweeping with the car in the usual morning traffic.
From the radio comes a special tune: the sound of a violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The music changes pace and the bass arrives next to previous tone colours, and then a female choir is connected as a real jewel.
Zagar's Wings of Love is on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music scene did not pamper us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the traffic is quite different if you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground, are slowly changing the overall picture, and even though the guitar-squeezing garage rock is back in fashion, the domestic electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs, and he himself played in Yonderboi's band until - perhaps because two honkers couldn't fit in a barn - he took his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, however, he began to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Season).
The formations initially played in smaller clubs were met by a wider audience when wan2 magazine listed their first album in 2002 as one of the fifty most important home albums, and declared Zagar, in Yonderboi's company, to the almost sole domestic trendmakers who appeared marketable in the west.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band became "trendi", but no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: it made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, now released, can open new paths for them, although the title itself wishes to create continuity with the initial years in Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer's old band there.
With the airy, flying reference, we would be on the spot, but besides the airmanship of music, we have now noticed the influence of the louder guitar, rock and roll, according to the spirit and trend of the time.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working with The Puzzle in England, showed himself at the album's premiere in Millenáris.
The album also produced a real radio hit, with mr2 Petőfi playing popular music from morning to evening recently starting to smuggle into the ears the grand tunes of Wings of Love recorded with the six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is okay (?).
He asked Balázs Zságer at hvg.hu.
hvg.hu: This new hit now raises the question: how much layer music is left to play?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of popular music castes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can be flat, meaningless, and in the same way prepare for merely sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can also arise out of genuine motivation.
The host attitude also operates in this spirit, regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Outside, especially west of us, there are greater traditions of light music.
It's not just about the age of sixteen or twenty. It's about older people.
Rather, they monitor the changes in popular music around them, because it is also considered part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people attend our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music for purpose, we have music for some reason.
The role of the audience is more perceptible at concerts, where the effect on each other already works, but this lies only in elusive changes in the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and built his career further west of us.
Zs.B.: We don't really go his way, even though sometimes they try to explain this to our music.
We're more like team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, since several of us were part of his band and started on another path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love placed first on the top list of Mr2 Petőfi.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time in this issue.
Did you consciously open up the more popular style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and then sell the record.
This song is more than that.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, which we used to try to unblock the sound organ and the more difficult themes that had been committed on the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when it came to the idea of putting this choir together from the good-sounding soloists of our own home music scene.
Thus came together the six - or Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - which was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Was the song designed or played like this by the girls?
Zs.B.: The number had existed for a long time in instrumental versions, and then when the record came together, we thought we needed something else for this number.
It was the chord progression that attracted me to sing on it.
Later that night, I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost the first time and scaryly spontaneous.
I remember I was very excited back then, but of course I needed the Belles.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked that hard.
hvg.hu: On both the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing fully together and are not louder than music, so music does not just accompany their song.
They were standing in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: Standing in the back was merely because of technical problems.
However, it is clear that we did not want to play solo roles.
That's what my mouth is all about, forget our ego a little bit, who comes from, where he goes, just let those particular wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
Zs.B.: There were more difficult pieces than the music creative process with any of them, rather than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a racing piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, then slowly everything was in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song about the new record?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concert and the "I've already let go" of the record.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Betrayal broker risked billions of dollars because of a feeling of inferiority
Unfaithful embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank giant Sociéte Générale, thus calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it does not seem to be untalented at all, Kerviel was rather just a great player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He has reduced mental ability," he said to his superiors notifying the police.
However, as Le Monde of France reported, Kerviel's testimony revealed that he had made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business at the end of the last year.
Crisis Not Just in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he claims in his testimony.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news appeared that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages to clients with low income or past repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that, and he put me on a good horse.
Its year-end profits reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"I didn't know how to announce the first half a billion," admits Kerviel and adds that he kept nothing for himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he forged his reports in such a way that it could not be revealed.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his dealings.
The risk was a profit
Were you afraid it would come out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought that just the fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would calm them down."
Where did you get the willpower to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant broker and became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of $90,000 per year.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, in my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with a bad eye.
It is also due to my education, professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
Soon after his entry, the first great success came.
Allianz earned money thanks to its shares as it placed half a billion euros in the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And it started an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know everything, or rather suspect.
"While I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he left for work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
It was his freedom that made him suspicious.
"I've only taken four days off in the last year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who does not want anyone to look into his reports," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic stands a chance to acquire 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government have signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can raise EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion krona) in the coming years.
It is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will receive approximately 125 billion crowns out of seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion krona from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, is for transportation.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and represents 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund of the Transport Infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win assets for innovation businesses.
Companies should also raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful in obtaining funds from the EU funds so far.
Ex-President Nicaragua has been approved by the court for 20 years in prison
The Nicaragua Court of Appeals approved on Thursday a 20-year prison sentence for financial fraud to Arnold Alemán, the country's former president, to which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud worth $100 million (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether or not the former leader of this Central American country will be back behind bars from 1997 to 2002, according to the AP news agency, is not clear yet.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the prison's management whether Alemán's sentence is being served at home or whether he goes back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that government funds were regularly transferred to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers actually belonged to their relatives and closest supporters.
He made some of these funds subsequently with a foundation, which he founded to fund Alemán's 2001 election campaign.
They've approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been passed.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without opposition support.
This year, he passed last year with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford to accept the no.
Unlike a loud debate before the vote on mistrust of the government, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives has passed this generally ignored, although most influential, law.
That's a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends at each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of the government and the powers of the opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, so you get much more attention in the media.
Politicians' debates are much more interesting to the public than just numbers.
The state budgets of past social democratic governments have faced three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high rate of mandatory so-called principal expenditure law, which represents not only pensions but also social benefits, approved last year by ČSSD and KSČM's silent "coalition" before the elections
The second is a consequence of the first deficiency in deficit management.
The third limitation is deficits in public funding, i.e. deficits in the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not a deficit in the state budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are deficits in the budget for cities and districts.
Many mayors can make money for investments other than money from taxes, levies, and bank loans, headlessly often issuing bonds with which their city halls became disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the massive sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks, which the State has received from privatisations.
They don't have that kind of resources at the moment.
Where we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we shall establish that:
For a few years now, our economy has been going through a growth phase, like the rest of the world, which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly in debt.
The other countries managed far more rationally than Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt.
This is primarily a huge disgrace to previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
There is therefore no need, for example, for large social programmes, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, swelled completely to gigantic size.
Although this year we have managed to eliminate the part of the senseless populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if there is no exodus of retirement and pension reform in the near future, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever governs it will only be official.
With a little exaggeration, most of the taxed money from governing politicians is usually turned into pensions and mechanical distributors of social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by principal expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if previous governments had not wasted everything they could have done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to become mere officials of the governing politicians, then we must be patient and wish peace of mind for this not too strong coalition government to prepare for further reform laws, knowing that the state can only give out as much as it can obtain from taxes and levies.
Only these will enable a balanced budget to be reached gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland, and Canada decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
The financial markets will thus cost more than a hundred billion dollars through the stock markets.
On these stock exchanges, interest rates are raised on the bank, for which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, U.S. Fed releases $40 billion on the stock market and makes another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central bank.
For the first time after the September 11 attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move should solve the biggest problems in the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl, from the Economic Outlook Group consulting firm, in his report.
"Coordinated action by central banks in the United States has reduced the probability of recession from 65 percent to thus about fifty percent," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost, primarily, $60 billion in the United States due to unrefunded loans.
Analysts expect additional billion-dollar losses.
"Central banks may indeed be afraid of what else might happen if they decided to do so," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems to be a really bad situation," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves find it difficult to access loans, they will also lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the need and push the American economy into recession with its potential consequences for economic growth throughout the world.
This was decided by the central banks after the failure to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank Supply Rate, which is used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, despite the fact that central banks of the U.S., Canada, and Britain also reduced their interest rates a few times during the fall.
"This will have a similar effect to further interest rate decline," told Reuters news agency Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' move contributes to averting the crisis as it does not solve the underlying problem, the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is a major threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticized the UN International Conference on Climate Change held in Bali.
His book Blue, not the green planet, presented in Vienna, made it clear that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, formed by a particular mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality accompanying it.
"The debate there absolutely lacks structure, it's just throwing words, which are replacements for solving current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that he was very important to his subject, which is why he is so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book also appears in German translation, since, as he said, "I often meet only cartoons of my opinion".
Now, interested parties can read your undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, he believes that he has sufficient funds to write such a book.
Because he is able to monitor and judge professional treatises he has experienced statistics as an academic and also an economist.
In concluding the book, he indicated as a thesis that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal, and that all scientists do not share the same opinion as regards planet warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so they are not a threat, and efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective, and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a man with experience in totalitarianism, he considers the exertion of unproven opinions on others unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of those present that "it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke of a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't change their driver's licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to change their old driver's license in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can request an exchange so that the offices can issue a new driver's license in time by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that a hundred thousand drivers would leave after the New Year without valid eligibility.
According to the offices, the driver's license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While districts represent a sharp fall in interest in driver's license exchanges, the capital offices were flooded with requests for driver's license exchanges, for which interest increased this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers per day.
It takes about half an hour to wait in line.
In Prague, the driver's license has not yet been replaced by about 140000 drivers.
A new driver's license lasts 20 days.
However, the new driver's license can also be requested with a five-day shortened deadline.
In such a case, however, the driver will have to pay an extra 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to make the mandatory change of driving licence by the end of the year and who leave with an invalid driving licence are in danger of being punished as of January.
The guilty must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the policeman may settle the offence by agreement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the penalty is 2500 kroner.
Based on previous information from City Hall, a person who travels nowhere can also be fined.
He is said to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The ministry had previously called on offices to be lenient and impose penalties of up to a thousand crowns.
However, according to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, several tens of thousands of fines threaten no one.
He thinks a driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an identity card that should be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It's enough to take it or to send it by mail to the right office.
At the end of the year, licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace the other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can replace them for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents involved.
Court reduced the sentence of Berdycchel-cooperative investigators
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, suspected of conspiring with David Berdych's crime syndicate, were given thirteen and ten years in prison.
This was determined by the Supreme Court of Prague with final effect, which thus reduced their sentences by one and two years for one and the other.
Investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were originally threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, a review can only be requested by the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in this case, he is waiting for a first-degree verdict.
In other proceedings, he has already received a total sentence of more than 16 years.
You can't have any more.
The County Court found primarily 19 people guilty in January by participating in robbery attacks, of which 16 appeals were discussed today by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the start of the investigation by saying it was a matter of speculation.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police, after the agreement with Berdycchel, provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered each robbery attack and helped the gang avoid impeachment of criminal responsibility.
The gang therefore surrendered 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
In the indictment, it is about the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
It is primarily about robberies whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the authority of a civil servant and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because police found illegally held pistols, steel-seeded shells, laser sightings, or machine guns during search.
The gang is charged with taking tens of millions of crowns with the robberies.
The gang of less than one twenty members has already been admitted legally guilty by the courts in this proceedings from Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment testify before the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought to court.
The first instance trial has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
For children traded in obstetrics, injured families lawyer Igor Veleba claims 12 million crowns of pain fee plus court expenses from the hospital in Třebíč.
Three million each for the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for the children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál Veleba, fundamentally disagrees with his proposal.
"We reject such a demand, as it is too much," Dostál said after today's trial.
"In order to have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We'll find out if it has any usable value at all.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone," emphasized Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was served by expert criticism on the basis of compensation negotiations, developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologist and psychiatrist experts, the children's parents suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was more tolerated by men, even if they encountered reproaches that did not prevent the replacement of a newborn.
Women cope worse with the actuality of trauma experienced and what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč obstetrics on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola Čermák's Přibyslavice, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
Vysočina's district head Miloš Vystrčil handed over 100,000 crowns to families in late October to replace their expenses, resulting from the fault of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have statutory damages insurance.
If they are wrong, they must reach into the reserve fund and, exceptionally, they may ask for the help of the founder.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for people, with amounts calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Polívka lost his kingdom of Valašsko
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit for the title of the kingdom of Valašsko.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, although he first used the name King Vanch, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor, with many years of work.
Polívka did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr Harabiš and his team paralyzing the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to Valachi Kingdom words, everyone thinks of the actor-comic.
This opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
He thinks the cause of the dispute is money.
"Years later, they realized that the project was successful and could gain something from it.
They want to live off our work," he added.
Profitable Business
According to the court, the name king of Valach was first used on Polívka's television show.
It was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý in 1993.
However, at the time this was unrelated to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing the Vanch passports.
The original student prank operation turned into business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabiš then based the creation of a society of the kingdom of Valašsko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature in passports, and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš used the idea himself, which Polívka made public for his business in Manes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka for the Valachi kingdom project must have helped," the judge said.
However, he added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who were intensively involved in it.
The cooperation of the parties who had been fighting today continued until 2000, when he organized an official coronation for Harabiš Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have accumulated between Polívka and Harabiš, which have resulted in the acquittal of "the forever elected King Boleslav I".
At the initiative of Harabiš, Jarmila Šulaková took the leading role in the kingdom as Queen Mother.
In 2002, he then filed a court action against Polívka Harabiš and his associates, which the court rejected today.
Light into the debate could be brought into the fight planned by Harabiš for the throne and half of the princess.
This fight should make him a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the time.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like the King's march in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr Polívka can also apply in peace," added Harabiš.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot Test: Vanishing Prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the path are nothing special, the quality of the change, the driving and the production can often be designated as below average.
But his successor Peugeot 207, already present on the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon called SW goes one more step further, so for me there's nothing left but to think more.
When I was testing the Peugeot 207's classic hatchback, for example, I complained about the space left for the head in the backseat.
This time the complaint is over here, as the bodywork of the station wagon means that the giants, two meters tall, are not suffering in this regard.
Speedy in the World
I can get through the interior so I don't repeat myself too many times.
This is a relatively well-managed design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer training here if the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or of armrests?
Side driving also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, there is also an increase in body sizes.
In the station wagon, the few places of the head already mentioned will disappear.
A suitcase in the trunk.
The main thing on this vehicle is therefore its luggage compartment.
This should be considered very accessible (and also thanks to the folding rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with support tires, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they're retractable, and they can carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume for a while.
This is based on the tables in the basic layout 428 l, which is rather an average value compared to competition.
However, it is not the most sought-after car in the Czech Republic - against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If you compare 207 SW with the product of the new generation of mladá boleslav, you will find that Peugeot is well behind the noticeably many 52 litres.
This value is almost critical for a holiday abroad or when a stroller is inserted.
But if I had to highlight the positives, then I would have to mention the almost completely straight flooring after the second row of backrests are down or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a 1.6 l volume, 88 kW power four-cylinder, light-ignition engine.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a thousand-sixty-five should look like, driving the family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-consumption and it pulls primarily.
If we compare it with Škoda's equivalent, which often acts as if a rag was stuffed in his exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
It's a whisper.
The price of a car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car will still go for 329 900 Kč with a four-cylinder foreign engine.
The car starts at 410 990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws the equipment with an additional 80,000 Kč.
But we even had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, rear windows, electrical remote control...
So the car costs 531 900 Kč with a case and draw.
This is a lot, but count Fabia's additional equipment and get a very similar result.
So there's nothing left to do but decide on the brand.
Unsuccessful integration of Slovak students in British schools
There are increasing numbers of Eastern European children in British schools, which cause locals concerns about the further development of local school affairs.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between children of immigrants and domestic residents have turned into violence.
The problems with the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in Northern Kent where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
The quarrels between the students, the quarrels, are already characteristic of the parents’ relations.
The situation went so far as police in Chatham detained a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by insulting him with racist curses.
The police had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacked Slovak immigrants.
The girls reportedly scolded the man with racist comments and threw stones at him.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop doing that, he struck us with apples and pears and then revealed his naked ass," the mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident classified disputes with Eastern European immigrants as a survival struggle.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is beginning to become tense.
In Britain, Slovaks earn 70,000 jobs are registered.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be done if you choose correctly.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm as a fish pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or intoxicated cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
However, you can find much more on an island, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards Cuba was a bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eyes have ever seen.
Havana became a treasure depot and transfer site that the Spanish had robbed in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
It was built by Lucky Luciano, a boss of the American mafia, as everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (primarily Prohibition), was hailed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Tower houses were built in Havana, and cars that became a cult symbol of the 50s of the last century ran on broad avenues.
Ernest Hemingway purchased an estate in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures of the stars and politicians of the American showbusiness.
What about today?
You can sign the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
They're making you a cocktail at the bar at the expensive Nacional Hotel.
And the cult cars of the 1950s still run in Havana, as the once exported viscerals and your son in this salty and wet air have long since rotted.
Although primarily the oldest part of Havana has fallen significantly, there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere else in the area as there is.
Other places are getting prettier, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides so much needed money, its development has been given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels not only have been built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the banks of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another unique delicacies in the world, primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to sugar plants by steam and trains.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so there are machines operating there, whose contemporaries are seen elsewhere only in museums.
Which way should we go?
Most of Cuba's most well-known places are not avoided.
So Varader or Havana doesn't need to be written too much.
Perhaps we should just remind you that the Hemingway estate mentioned above has a museum, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss visiting this museum.
The Viňales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lewd vegetation grows from the lime pit.
Limestone formations, lime-mountains, and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has accumulated in their burrows, thanks to which the scattered cliffs are also covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be encountered when visiting one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that they shot Major Zeman's Chilean episode there.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spaniards.
Fame and glory came from the slave and sugar trade.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not-so-great city.
The colonial Spanish architecture significantly influenced by later French settlers changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad is such a secluded place between the Escambray plain and sea that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads that connected this region to the rest of the country.
That certain isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't tear me down, so everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon on Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancon coast or the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening, it is fitting to go to the Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where the music will not be quiet until morning.
Baracoa
The town in eastern Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo to there must overcome high and divided mountains, they pass through the nature almost barely affected by human activity.
Thanks to the untouched nature there, Cuba's eastern land language has been added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
Here is the best chocolate made, the church has Columbus' cross (in reality it was made a hundred years after Columbus' shipping) and the hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel stands, with some tablet-mountains, the best known of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plains, Bay of Pigs and the Island of Isla de Pinos, Tropicana cabaret, Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, African religion, professed by the descendants of former slaves, there is a great deal to be written about.
I mean, as they say correctly, it's better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, states Americans
Few soldiers and the lack of equipment required also influence the course of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as planned, with leaders of countries in Edinburgh, Scotland having units in the southern part of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries also consult on further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States, assisted by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called NATO troops for more activity this week, Britain considers the Afghan government's strengthening and strengthening development assistance as its primary priority.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to launch further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The Afghan insurgents' activity has been strongest in the last five years, according to US government data.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to last year and 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, roughly one-quarter in the southern areas.
However, according to the United States, the Allies also reached their borders in organizing and equipping troops.
Specifically, additional helicopters, soldiers, and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
"We must seriously think about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them," řekl Gates.
A similar spirit was spoken today by Jaap de Hoop, Secretary General of NATO.
"I am not happy with what is in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told the Reuters news agency at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out Passive
There have also been discussions among participating countries over the last few months as to whether all the allies are providing the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas where the least violence and combat requirements are thus not as high against them as against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan slackers have been exposed: The Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," wrote the Sun in material supplemented with a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and published a photo of a British team's rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt reaches one trillion in 2009
Every Czech has a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt reached 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry had reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroner due to better development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt reached 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, this rose by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, as of June, it fell by 13.4 billion kroner.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed today its sovereign debt data from early October.
More than 84,000 kroner is owed to each Czech.
Last year, the state owed over 11 billion crowns.
"It seems that, thanks to the lower deficit next year, the limit of one trillion crowns could not be exceeded until 2009.
The following year the debt will move around 900 billion and a trillion crowns," mentioned iHNed.cz server Patria Finance analyst David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees this: "In 2009 we can cross the one trillion.
Exactly when, depending on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation in the field of politics were to change, politicians would be willing to save more, this could be delayed until 2010.
But I'm not assuming this change," he mentioned.
Growth in debt
Government debt is the central government's debt, which is formed primarily by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed by cashier’s tickets, public loan bonds, direct loans or loans from, for example, the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal indebtedness has increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor so far.
The foreign debt of the state has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called saleable debt reached 803.3 billion kroner by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kroner from June.
The average maturity of the government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The year-to-year debt rose by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is indeed quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform is here," commented Pikora on the data.
It's better than expected.
The financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By early December, however, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The amount consists primarily of the government budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the assumed 91.3 billion kroner.
Furthermore, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, a 43 billion krona funding of public loan bonds and a repayment of 1.8 billion krona loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears today in a court in Khartoum because of a name given to a teddy bear
A court in Khartoum sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country in Sudan on Thursday night for the violation of Islam, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad. Islam, however, prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested in her own apartment on Sunday. Under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, she was accused of violating Islam and rioting after the students' parents repeatedly complained against her at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6–7-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"The children proposed a total of eight names: including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, by vote, 20 out of 23 children chose the first name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common given name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the bear's photo and "My name is Muhammad".
The problem is that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
A Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school, said that he knew her well and that the teacher would never have done anything to violate any religious conviction. He said it was just a "no harm": "I'm only sorry that he had the children vote the name".
Many students of the teacher agree with this view. They think the teacher is "very good with children" and "never talks about religion in class".
Let us not forget that Muhammad is also the second most popular given name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing respect for the prophet. — Often given to the firstborn child of the family.
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can this name be given to a game, for example?
It's obviously a question of interpretation.
No agreement was reached at the last Vienna trial on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and final discussion between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the Separatist province ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties did not reach an agreement on status," stated EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger at a Vienna press conference.
The U.S. ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises of maintaining peace and dialogue even after the negotiations.
"There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but a very difficult time ahead," he added, stressing the "presence of obvious tensions".
On December 10, the broadcast ends
On Monday, the mediator troika, including the European Union, the United States of America and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-inhabited province may be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harcshenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, marked the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the UN commissioned the troika to broadcast again last August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation task to be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already thwarted the issue of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, in favour of compromise," Bocan-Harcshenko stated.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
With Kosovo under the control of the UN for 8 years, Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said that she was ready to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in her favor.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have failed to reach an agreement," declared the president of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden where "the negotiations of last chance have been conducted since Monday".
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
However, he added that Belgrade's idea of autonomy would be "a continuation of a past that would result in murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that the compromise was still possible, and the Albanian majority in Kosovo was warned about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" because of the wars of independence in the 1990s in the region that is still unstable.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise," said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be solely for the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto rights.
"Kosovo parliament gets final word"
"Only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica stated.
"The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end at the same place as they began: the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word". He added that the unilateral cry of independence by the Albanians is based on "conciliation" with the Western powers.
Bush urges agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced on Tuesday, at the opening of the International Peace Conference he held in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint statement.
According to Bush's statement, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to enter into negotiations without delay for a final settlement of 60 years of dispute between their peoples.
Bush promised in the presence of the two presidents that he would support them in every way possible in order to sign the "peace treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must eliminate "terrorist networks" and Israel must abandon its colonial activities, Bush stated, as well as reminding the two parties of their obligations to the "peace schedule" adopted in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that negotiations between the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas and Israel are intended to "sign a peace treaty with which all pending problems will be resolved, including central issues".
The latter concern three sensitive problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who resided in the territory of today's Israeli state.
Speaking after the U.S. President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and profound" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, national borders, colonies, water and security".
Afterwards, Olmert, who took the stand, promised that future negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and he would strive for them to be "completed in 2008".
Bush set by the end of 2008 the realization of the "vision of two states" of Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia said that it had received a promise from Bush to do so before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which Washington considered its participation in Annapolis to be a success) initiated with the support of all Arab countries a plan that guarantees peace for Israel if in return it withdraws from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "means an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on central issues," the Saudi prince believes in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and rumours contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data from the investigation launched by the national police general inspection body (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 17 o'clock.
"The car was on patrol, so it wasn't in action. It was moving at 40, 50 km/h without sirens," we heard from police sources.
The young man without two helmets drove at "high speeds" with a green "not included in the official register, so not to be used on road traffic" (see below) Kawasaki brand engine.
"Since the right-hand rule was not complied with, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a police officer.
The alcohol test on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the collision that the front of the car dented, the windshield cracked in the shape of a star, and the bumper broke off.
Pontoise's state's attorney Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced yesterday morning in his extraordinary announcement that he had commissioned IGPN and Val-D'Oise County Public Safety Directorate to investigate "for failure to commit manslaughter and assistance in negligence".
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that the responsibility of police officers at the current stage of the IGPN investigation could be ruled out.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interviewed in the accident on Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the scooter had arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
On yesterday, from a stripe undoubtedly drawn by footstands on the roadway, it was shown that the two vehicles had clenched and moved together for a while until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles were seized for technical testing.
The coroner's examination of the bodies of the two victims was carried out yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, rumors spread like wildfire in Villiers-le-Bel that police officers quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two youths.
In this regard, IGPN puts it with caution, but rules out that police officers would have made "any serious mistake".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and special caution in doing so," we learned from police sources.
Libération met with a witness who reported on the few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows in his apartment overlooks the exact scene.
"With my cousin, a hospital nurse, we immediately went down to try to revive them," says the witness.
"There was nothing more we could do."
He then noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and limping.
The other two tried to revive one youth, and the fourth phoned".
Tension among those present increased as the hopeless situation of the two youths became apparent, so the incoming police drove their colleagues away from the scene.
We also know from the witness's statement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also used CPR, but it didn't work.
"I wouldn't say the police weren't trying to help the young.
Young people did get help.
Fire department immediately arrived at the scene.
They did everything they could to save them," the prosecutor emphasized.
Tensions Increase in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first protests after the state of emergency introduced two days earlier by General Musarraf.
According to eyewitnesses, approximately two thousand lawyers protesting the measures imposed during the state of emergency in the eastern part of the country, in the city of Lahore, were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at police officers, several of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers have been produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked lawyers and wounded them.
They made more than one person.
In Islamabad, registered attorneys from the Supreme Court called for a general strike and protests were announced over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed in order to prevent the gathering.
There were also several protests in Multan in central part of the country and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyer movement has been supported by the vast Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which unites religious parties. Its leader "incited the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who swore an oath before Musarraf."
"Musarraf's promise no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
The Court will have to declare the legality of President Musarraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October in the coming days.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from his post and replaced by another.
"All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's decisions," the President told The News newspaper.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the army to serve as civilian president after the introduction of the state of emergency "has ceased to apply", announced the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem, on Monday.
Musarraf had to part with the military uniform until November 15, or the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has otherwise refuted the nationwide rumour that President Musarraf would have been assigned a forced residence by his deputy general.
More than one third of pregnancies are not intended
This results in unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demography (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalizing contraception.
This results in unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception such as tablets or beespiral still fail in 5–6% of cases.
However, according to the institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made birth control more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 had taken birth control pills in 1970, but this rate is now 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five designs with a few months of precision, and if possible by spring, since this is the most favorable season for receiving the child.
Spectacular repair on space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the International Space Station (ISS) crew had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of the broken solar panel essential to the station's scientific activity.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in several ways: repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design it, and it had to be done away from the housing modules with tools "built" by astronauts.
The problem came on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, their power needs to be provided.
The crew's second task, therefore, was to move one of the modules producing electricity using the 17.5-ton solar panels that was already on the ISS to its final location.
Then the crew began opening the module's 76-metre-wide solar panels.
Of the harmonically foldable boards, one was then offended by a stranded cable about 1 metre in length.
To avoid further damage, the tablet was not continued to be opened.
The astronauts originally had the task of taking a control walk from the Discovery shuttle and then repairing another solar panel with malfunctioning rotation systems. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repair the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt by hanging on the 30-metre robotic arm of the shuttle attached to the station's crane.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
He's tall, he's strong, he's extremely skilled, he's got a muscular upper torso and a long arm.
So the 46-year-old doctor-educated man had to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage caused, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with some "rails".
He was also assisted in his work by another "space walker" who remained near the safe passage, as well as from inside by other astronauts, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, which was fitted with insulation against hundreds of volts of tension from solar panels, was concocted by the station's astronauts and "caved together".
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his companions fully opened the board and only then packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and today seven of them returned to Discovery's space silo to begin their Wednesday planned return.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is decreasing
The exchange rate of EADS shares on the Paris Stock Exchange fell greatly after the company manufacturing aircraft and defense equipment announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of €1.2–1.4 billion.
EADS shares currently have an exchange rate of EUR 21.96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating result, as the development of A400M's engine is delayed, causing the aircraft's delivery to be delayed, obviously.
The delay in transferring the tactical transport aircraft, announced in October, "will cost between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will affect Airbus", announced the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
Due to the occurrence of these expenditures, EADS will have to provide new plan numbers for its 2007 operating result next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added but did not provide any further figures.
The group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS' operating result decreased by 86%: this was largely due to delays in the development of another program, the A380 giant machine, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Staying on status quo
Sunday elections do not promise a big surprise: the large majority of Russians will vote for Putin's head of state party, the Unified Russia.
In this, the Russians' need for stability, perhaps arbitrary government, is evident after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian head of state Vladimir Putin speaks to the electorate via public service channels in a televised message, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin leads the single Russia candidate list supporting the Kremlin, which is expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
When foreign ambassadors were captured yesterday, the behaviour of the head of state did not reveal anything: it merely made another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any infringement," he added.
According to the opposition, however, this is far from the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they believe they have put pressure on the electorate.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov claims "there was no such dirty choice in Russia even in Yeltsin's time".
After beating down protests last weekend, former World Chess Champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorised protest, and his lawyer claims he is still not allowed to visit.
"Russians still think as 'homo sovieticus'"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin to the head of state?
The official paper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, and candidates may indicate their intention to run by 23 December.
As Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his term of office cannot be extended any longer.
But there's no other offspring on the horizon.
What role does Putin play from March?
You're going to be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as the leader of the all-powerful Unified Russia party and the parliamentary majority?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power triumphs in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's become a tradition now.
"The Russians still think like 'homo sovieticus': they do not feel they can control their fate," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people. All the more so, as this new type of paternalism did not involve intimidation but a certain economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility of their own accord", which was quickly shown after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all sectors of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the Unified Russia are led by 65 governors, who come from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cserednitchenko, 54, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Remarkable Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometers of shelves in Bad Arolsen, in the province of Hessen, have so far only been researchable for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they only provided unique and name-name insights for former victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, managing the archives agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archives allows historians to conduct research on "the relocation of inmates, residents of camps, and the health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may have suspected homosexuality or mental disability.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to locate civilians who were deported or sentenced to forced labour and possibly provide evidence of their internment, which allowed them to receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, some of the community of scientists do not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive of outstanding importance.
"These documents contain basically nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India would sign a Free Trade Agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to €60 billion.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath.
As early as April last year, EU foreign ministers approved that the European Commission should open negotiations for the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th most important trading partner, according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement can have an economic recovery effect for both sides" and "India could thus increase its presence in a thriving market with 450 million inhabitants".
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, the European Commissioner added. Every year, the two giants, Europe and Asia, will exchange "a product worth €47 billion" and "a service worth €10 billion", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi. However, he regretted that bilateral trade has "still not achieved its full potential". The EU and India will meet on Friday in New Delhi in the framework of the Eighth Diplomatic Summit, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Response to concerns: Bank of England offers £10 billion to the financial market for five weeks
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the unrest about credit conditions, so on Thursday it announced that it would pump £10 billion into the money market, which it would make available this time with a base rate of 5.75% and a five-week term unlike usual.
"We want to ease the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered on the international money market as part of a five-week open market operation from 6 December", the bank's press release states.
According to the bank's statement, £10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December, at 12:15 local time.
This is the first time the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that it was "ready to take further measures" in order to align interbank loans with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the September 18th level: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant penalty interest on the amounts pumped into the financial market, which has deterred banks from using them.
According to the rumours (confirmed by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound compared to the euro), many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been obtained with more favourable interest and discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups were excluded from discussing articles in the Socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists included about ten measures, which were adopted by the Socialist Party's national office on Tuesday, including, for example, an increase of 50% in the employment allowance, the reintroduction of variable fuel tax, the introduction of travel cheques and the limitation of rents.
As the UMP and NC voted 180:115 against examining articles, the discussion between the ruling party and the opposition at times in sharp-spoken arguments was eventually interrupted, only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that all of his group's proposals would be re-submitted in the framework of the amendment of the corrective financial bill, which will be on the Parliament's agenda next week.
A new festival is born
A number of rumours circulated about the new Philadelphia music festival to be held by C3 Presents. However, now the company organising and promoting the event announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in collaboration with Melvin Benn's British producer company Festival Republic.
"It is an honor for us to work with a man who is the starter of today's American festival movement," said Billboard.com Charlie Jones of C3.
C3 also organizes the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits music festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey is held in summer, so there will be a way to tent.
The festival takes place between August 8 and 10, in a 500 acres private area located about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
He began organizing the British Reading Festival in 1989, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his palette with the organisation of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival. This festival is now able to accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3 associate Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival the "most inspiring event" he ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enriching the region with a European style festival event.
"The Philadelphia site has already been selected, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we have worked hard to host this festival in central Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We have pursued an understatement with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, the organization failed due to the city administration's political maneuvers," continued Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we are about to host a huge festival at another unique venue, which ultimately also serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park, Chicago, after proving its exceptional festival organizer talent with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The gross income for the two events was $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals were held at urban venues.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas, says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both the European rural atmosphere and the urban feeling that is common in America."
Vineland is located approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's population and even the mayor himself are enthusiastic about supporting the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the terms are favorable enough to allow investment in an event of this magnitude at a site that hopefully houses the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "giant" in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the capacity of 80,000 at the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already been invited to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we are planning a variety of musical offerings so that everyone can find something they like in it," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners Charlie Walker and Charles Attal form the company C3, which received the "best independent event organizer" recognition at the latest Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal confronts Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator himself...
"Surprise" is one of the duties of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Verminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best venue for it.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favorable, that's where you'll go.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on the basis of which they decide for us," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now mostly focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it is the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres received a favorable reception at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is also shown in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec was also represented with four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest event this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts' opinions are shared by the subprime crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to their usual year-end hair.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "from a statistical point of view, in December the stock market tends to behave positively.
However, forecasts with a purely statistical background are not necessarily correct, and even in the current situation the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term".
Experts are far from advocating the year-end takeover of the stock market, although they state that "the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this is an opportunity to invest, as there is a lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed yields, which are negatively affected by escape to quality securities, both long and short term".
As a result, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a more lateral, non-volatility-free movement, "mainly because the impact of the Fed interest rate reduction is not yet known, because the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tensions are also threatened".
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means he believes it would be risky to declare that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "it's not a good thing."
Ibex's loss is nearly 4 percent compared to the highest values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15.945.7.
Even so, not all experts are so gloomy.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 points due to reorganization of wallets and payments to the usual pension fund at this time.
However, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally shifts to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Festival of the Constitution.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and "because of this we are experiencing a decline in the stock market index, which may also rise depending on news from the US regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis".
Analyst trusts these will be favorable.
Analysts agree on which securities will be targeted to reach Ibex's new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "it's on big securities this time".
The expert would add the two major banks and some construction companies to the list, "as the electric sector will be very expensive by then".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally can also be positive for construction companies, if at all.
"ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow it along this path," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be the main character of the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although there is not a very high representation on the Spanish market in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two drops in December.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003 when the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent, a 6.68% jump was registered in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (at the moment, Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the end rally can occur.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens a 12 hour open account from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español decided to renovate most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and make a big difference for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, because this is the first group whose branches are unconventionally open from 10 am to 20.30 pm, even on Saturdays.
The other group, BBVA, which also repeatedly stated that it was planning an extended opening of its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to make an agreement with the unions that he'd close 75% of his accounts to open up in exchange for an afternoon, though not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for other institutions, as this will be the basis for deciding whether to join an initiative to promote better business opening.
This is precisely the objective of Banco's Popular Español project.
In these places, I would like to target private shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, self-employed people and local businesses.
The bank wants to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain with the above mentioned opening hours for 18 months, as it is not a new opening order, but a restructuring of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernises its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of customers on each street.
In this way, the extension of opening hours is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the branches, a more modern and colorful design.
Commercial banks responsible Ángel Rivera points out that there is no need for large investments in restructuring, but they have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
Branches, including negotiators for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Favorable Experiences
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three branches in Madrid.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was favorable.
Branches in Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid were chosen, and Rivero said the decision proved correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, and also has a very favourable opening order, even opening on Sundays and holidays.
In these units of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers", points out Rivero.
At the moment, they have managed to reach agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
"We Did It".
With this sentence, he expressed satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the market by Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's acting advisor, when it was revealed that the TV station he ran doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
One thing still overshadowed his joy: "It only hurts that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less," he said.
Even so, he placed great emphasis on the fact that in the weak market "we fell less".
Telecinco closed at 2.54 percent yesterday.
This increase places its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
52 percent of the company belongs to Mediaset, 13 percent to Vocento, thus its stock market value is EUR 4.488.88 million according to Bloomberg's data.
His rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has a 40.5% fall since January, making it worth half as much yesterday, $2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can achieve in the same market, at what costs, and how this will pay back in terms of ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to become the first TV channel in excess of gross 1 billion advertising revenues, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting advisor to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the latter being a subsidiary of the group.
If the reported fact were to be fulfilled, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent compared to 965.4 million recorded in the financial year 2006.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (i.e. reaching 733.4 million), while the net turnover of television increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
Analysts say that one of the factors that triggered Telecinco's stock market momentum is the high pay out held up so far: in 2006, the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of its yield among its shareholders.
According to Vasile - although it is too early to decide - this ratio may change after buying 33% of Endemol, in association with its parent company Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee payment of the minimum 50%, although we have always allocated much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, since we have already favored them with the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol".
Analysts say the market is currently characterised by a slight slowdown.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced Telecinco's yield estimates by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the estimated increase in turnover falling from 10.5 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent in 2009 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
According to the same company's forecasts, Antena 3's profits will decrease by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: proposes to purchase both securities, mainly due to their high profitability and long-term sustainable potential from dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favourable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (maintainment) due to its "multiple attractiveness" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: proposes underweighting in both cases due to "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the takeover of MiFID, which took effect on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary process, which ended today with the Congressional vote approving Senate amendments, the government initiated a social dialogue on the legislation on which the law is based, so that both could come into force before the end of the year.
Representatives from different groups have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable normative to protect investors and to regulate the activities of companies in detail, in order to operate effectively on the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Act, allows financial markets to be modernised, while at the same time strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services for specialised firms, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new financial services company form (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems carrying out execution of orders, which compete with current stock exchange participants.
Furthermore, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide market information on the relevant aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods, and should keep records of all operations carried out in order to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Economic Committee of Congress has introduced a number of amendments, of which it is of paramount importance that the securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds, due to the high risk to the investor, which has been confirmed in the context of high risk mortgage lending in the US (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of the activities of those with economic and entrepreneurship qualifications.
The Senate has also proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the agent of the intermediary who works on another account, does not need CNMV's permission, and can market products or acquire customers for several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account in calculating the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is consistent with the Eurostat and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data that are comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used as for the calculation of the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs to estimate information that is not yet available at the moment of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator was purely indicative and could therefore deviate from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"Consumer Price Index continues to show relatively high value".
Pedro Solbes, a Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only "temporary", but at the same time predicted that the price index would be expected to show a "relatively high" value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not really favourable", the inflation rate in Spain within the monetary union has remained more or less at the same level in recent years.
He also added that the month of November brought "less surprises" than the previous month when the Government did not count on such a large increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%" was recognised by the Minister for Economic Affairs in relation to the data published today.
With Northern Rock, Virgin wants €42 billion in three years.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by over 50% and currently only £12 billion (EUR 16 billion 800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the English National Bank.
At the time, it still had a record amount of over £25 billion deposits, the number of which gradually declined over the past two and a half months due to loss of customer confidence, despite the Government's promise to the bank of a hundred percent guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name Virgin Money. Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of the British bank's revenues over the next three years to obtain the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of $30 billion.
The high profile businessman Richard Branson's group intends to spend some £50 million (i.e. €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve the target.
Northern Rock highlighted Virgin's consortium offer this week as the best way to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
They arrested the mayor of Totana for a suspected corruption case.
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor (Popular Party) of the village of Totana in Murcia Province at dawn today, as he is suspected of being involved in the urban corruption scandal that broke out this week.
Other than him, a city hall secretary and the city chief of police were arrested.
Formerly a city representative, José Martínez Andreo took over the seat of the People's Party Representative Juan Morales in May, who, according to official bodies interviewed by the SER radio channel, may have been the head of the corruption network.
Police continue to investigate the city's offices as well as the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also under investigation as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to SER radio station information, the pro-ethnic Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with the corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing a city development agreement with a construction company in Galicia to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the PSOE nomination in Toledo and his position as Parliamentary President if they win the elections.
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer by the Prime Minister and also the Socialist Party Secretary General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the list of PSOE in Toledo in the next parliamentary elections and to serve as Speaker of Parliament if Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE Organizational Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and was confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal headquarters today at noon following a discussion with Zapatero.
The head of government justified his election to the former minister by saying "we have to count the best" in politics, and Bono is "one of the best".
In addition, he added that "probably" the Mancha politician would become the Socialist Party's candidate for Parliament's presidency if socialists won in the upcoming elections.
Bono would take the place of the current parliamentary president Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he had no intention of running for the next elections and giving up his political career would rather fight this climate change in scientific circles.
The former Minister admitted that the Head of Government had constantly besieged him to return to the political scene since he abandoned active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the electorate is aware of who will be the economic vice president in the event of the Socialist victory, the party also wanted to inform them of who would be the President of Parliament in the spirit of "transparency".
If Bono will indeed hold the post, he would like Parliament to be "the scene of respect and not insult or shouting" and more like the home of citizens.
"Unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid where there is no peace of mind to talk, there have been times when the Head of Government's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate".
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Marín, his "excellent work", but did not want to make himself a president already, lest his opponents consider him "supervisor".
Campaign for Climate
As the movement that proclaims climate change relentlessly pursues both skeptical towards their predictions and those who prefer political or social skirmishes, it must be very strong.
In fact, he must also side with a political leader such as the Head of Government Zapatero, who says the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and proclaims that "we must enter into a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which its government's activity or inactivity contributed to Spain's leading position in non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for failing to comply with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
It should also clearly explain to the Spanish what measures they intend to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits should the population change, what energy savings at individual and social levels should we expect, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have neither received nor will we be given an explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
The measures taken by climate change, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and involve expenses for both companies and the population.
Even PSOE's petrol price increase would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, merely propaganda texts, empty passwords free of actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, even makes election rallies beautiful and gives us affection.

They arrested the mayor and chief of police of Totana for a suspected corruption case.
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana City, Murca Province, pro-ethnic José Martínez Andreo, local Police Chief, City Hall secretary, and a catering contractor for crimes related to urban development, were informed today by police sources.
The mayor was arrested at his home and then transferred to City Hall, and he is currently there with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for managing the Industrial Colonies and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday in Galicia, Madrid, and Murcia by the arrest of six persons in connection with a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land was reclassified into an area that could be built up to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes after having been illegally paid commissions to managers during their previous term of office.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the information provided by the Court of Justice No. 1 of Totana.
The first six arrested were turned over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana is Juan Morales, who is now an independent MP for the People's Party also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the previous mayor, who lives in the provincial center of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A. lawyer and entrepreneur, were arrested in Nigrán, Pontevedra, along with Suelo de Inmonuar company director Pablo José M.G. The latter company is part of the Nuaria Group and the bribes were carried out through him.
The investigation is carried out by a group of Gendarmerie's Operational Central Unit charged with crimes at municipal level, whose members held eleven search warrants apart from arrests, primarily in companies associated with those arrested, operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the area who could play an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in the city of Totana, for which 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels would have been built.
The company acquired 2.2 million square feet of land in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement currently with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar in real estate broadcasting, Conycase in charge of handling the parking lots of Coruna, Venezuela Streets and Catholic Ferdinand Square in Vigo, Hogartel in direct marketing and Preconiza in charge of selling, promoting and installing building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland's largest daily newspapers: (probably at the head of the PISA report on the world's level of culture), in Helsingin Sanomat, suggesting what appeared on November 18 at the same time as a review of Blackburn's book.
"Phosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
The killer, a student about to graduate, quoted Plato and Nietzsche's writings in his messages.
Education Councillor Pekka Elo, charged with teaching philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat daily newspaper that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical eye, then added that Nietzsche's knowledge was not necessarily important in classes of mandatory basic philosophy in high schools".

One of your colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains a misdemeanor related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a track is considered a misdemeanor and can be punished from six months to a year.
However, if you steal a record worth less than EUR 400 in a store, it is a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, theft is a misdemeanor, but your sentence still does not reach the amount of punishment that can be imposed in the case of Internet download (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the amount of punishment that can be imposed in case of Internet download (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass struggle, you can receive a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 BTK), but a sentence of six months to two years for copying the CD disc
(Article 270 BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. Distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of authors is more punishable than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My GP gave me an article on strange research titled "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it".
That is, employees' feelings on payday depend on how much the others have received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn, by tomographic measurement of magnetic resonances, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
In the opinion of the author of the study and the head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, "The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly, but his partner made a mistake".
Researchers found that if both gave the correct answer and received the same amount of money reward, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double dose, the activity also intensified.
I have no idea why it took so much science for such a simple conclusion.
Attorney General of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague and investigating crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
His term expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste of mouth, as they are responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Bosnian leader Radovan Karajich remain at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's list (2006, not yet presented in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as she tries to pressure the affected governments to get the loop around the fleeing criminals.
What kind of insurance would suit me?
Motor insurance, which provides safety for the owner of the car, brings significant costs to the various damage events and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured, and nature of use.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance undertaking.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company will accept compensation for the fixed insurance premium in the event of the event.
The insurance fee is essentially the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining a licence, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and so on.
Insurance companies establish insurance premiums on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by a person who presents a higher risk of accidents.
This is why women over the age of 25 or pay less because statistics show that they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the statements, insurance companies concluded that married people cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
For the type of use of the car, frequency is the decisive one.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident occurring.
A number of factors are taken into account by insurance companies when setting insurance premiums.
Therefore, the owner has to look closely into it so that he can choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we will present the most important factors for the choice, so that it can be best adapted to the needs of the insured person and at an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 face a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and freshness of driving licence.
Although it is most ideal to be secure against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can take full insurance with themselves, thereby ensuring all dangers, and the price will also be affordable.
For this type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
"The amount of self-sufficiency payable by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the self-sufficiency," says Luis Noguera, head of Internet insurance intermediary First Europe in Spain.
Another option is extended liability insurance for third parties when the client provides himself against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it will also be ensured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, because this will affect the bonus and you can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
It is called a bonus on the benefits granted to the basic insurance company.
And compared to the basic tariff, we call it a rave.
"The bonus and the scale of the malt depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the rate of bonus," explains Noguera.
Once the age limit of 25 has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take appropriate insurance, as the accident risk is reduced due to experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to take full insurance with you.
"In general, young people are not yet able to apply their experiences properly during an accident or even when driving," claims the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when leaders have already exceeded the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but does not have children yet, it is best to take full insurance, of course, if his financial options allow that.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be clients with the least risk and therefore the fee to be paid is lower in their case.
In this case, the best is full insurance (this can reach EUR 300) or if they have a higher bonus, they can extend the insurance to damage to others from the third year of the vehicle.
"They lead more calmly, at the same time they have greater purchasing power and can afford to be higher in share", affirmed by Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend full insurance (around EUR 150) with you, or in the case of a higher bonus you can extend to liability insurance.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it protects the owner in the event of damage events, but also because it represents a large expense, so it is essential that we choose a tailor-made form of insurance properly.
Celtic wants to score in Milan to make it to the eighth finals.
Milan and Celtic will measure their strength at San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to gain the missing point at the closing of the Champions League. Italians can be the first to do so, and Scots can qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already in the fifth round they secured the advance with a draw with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but it would take one more to prevent the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica, from overtaking it.
The two games of Group D will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milán will have to play in Japan at the Club World Cup, where he will try to reach the 16th final in the semifinals on the 13th.
With this Group D will close sooner than the others, and although the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be the tie, the two teams will seek victory, as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first place to compete in the eighth final.
Even defeat to Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but can't be sure of this, since if there is a point equal, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2-1) last week will go on to win the next fight (2–0).
The Italians will try to make the evening of the Scots bitter, who would like to make it to the eighth finals of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row after losing a goal to the Rooster in a post-0 draw extension (1-0) just there in the previous season.
The "Rossonerik" victory would be most welcome by the Shakhtar, because if it loses, Celtic will be placed in the eighth final and remain in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite currently being in last place and having no chance of staying in the European Championship, can still earn third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 viewers for the first time since they disbanded in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band was "in great form".
Some 20,000 people switched tickets to be at the concert, which also featured a video film about the band's history that had huge success in the 1990s.
Along with the band's reunion and tour, EMI also released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls staged in a bracelet from her husband "Posh Spice", British soccer player David Beckham.
The athlete was also at GM Place's crowded auditorium, although a few days earlier Victoria banned him.
Upon the performance's announcement, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has never seen our performance dress before, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the performance".
'Sporty Spice', was the reason the band disbanded two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because members didn't understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings for Spice Girls had changed.
I thought, "Why not?" Now I'm glad I decided to do so," said Chisholm about the band that broke up nine years earlier because of him.
The singer also added that during the time "things have settled and we love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on Virgin Airlines' special jet.
They had a bunch of baby-sitters waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team performs in California, U.S.A., followed by San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7)
They're performing in Madrid on December 23rd.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
There has been a renewed gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which could also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Much of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always of great attention.
Kiev stated that if Moscow raises the gas price to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia at higher transit costs.
A previous debate between the two countries last year resulted in a reduction in supplies to EU countries.
The most recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow concerns the attempt to reach an agreement between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on the level of the gas price to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would have to carry out a 50% increase in gas extracted from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in prices for the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in accordance with one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoly Kinah told the Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the scale of transit costs through Ukraine (and heading to Western Europe)."
As a result of the recent major gas price dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom blocked the gas tap to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly pushed up prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's gas supply.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS is "required to control foreign workers"
Scottish NHS committees need to improve the control of criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was put forward by Chief Comptroller Robert Black after a doctor of foreign nationality was associated with an attack on Glasgow Airport in June in Scotland.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland did not have accurate data on its number of overseas employees.
At the same time, it pointed out in its report, through a sample of five health authorities, key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the main auditor checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove into the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors interrogated by the Old Bailey Court through video contact in October on charges of car bombing attempts on UK territory.
The NHS committees should check the existence of qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and their provision of permits to work in the United Kingdom before starting employment for their employees from overseas countries.
Although Scottish health committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside Britain.
Among other things, the Auditor General's report proposed that committees introduce guidance from the Bureau of Criminal Records, which makes it easier for employers to monitor with different overseas countries.
"Although evidence of such checks has been found among records of staff, they are not regularly carried out," states the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own screening process prior to employment at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the developmentable areas of the system in order to have up-to-date information on the number of NHS personnel from overseas".
According to Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, it is "extremely unrealistic" to use pre-employment checks to identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report says that pre-employment checks currently in use are working well in NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals brought is not yet transparent," he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the majority of their overseas employees, consisting of doctors and nurses, represent 1161.
However, the rapporteur-general pointed out that the figures were likely to be higher, which can be partly explained by the fact that the Committees have a problem identifying employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran areas, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde areas, Lanarkshire, and the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and certificates of competence.
The Scottish Government is currently examining a directive and guidance on pre-employment checks of NHS employees from overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was very pleased that this task was carried out following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the health committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the updated guidance on pre-employee controls for the entire staff, including those from overseas countries, reflects the best practical application.The updated version is planned to be published next month.
Joy Division kicks off at the film awards
Biopic about Joy Division's late singer Ian Curtis, "Control", swept five awards at the British Independent Film Awards - including the award for Best Film.
A prize was also awarded to the lead character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse prior to Curtis' performance, as well as director Anton Corbijn and supporting character Toby Kebbell.
The award for Best Actress was won by Dame Judi Dench with the thriller "Details of a Scandal".
And the Variety Award - for putting the British film in the international spotlight - was taken by Daniel Craig, who played Bond.
The awards were awarded as part of the ceremony held at Roundhouse, London.
The film "Control" presents Curtis' rise within Joy Division berkei until 1980, when - at the age of 23 - he committed suicide.
The production of the black and white film, which also features "The Killers", David Bowie, and "New Order on the soundtrack", cost only £3 million.
Dutch photographer Corbijn - who had previously become known by producing the album cover for U2 "Joshua Tree" - has nevertheless been enriched with two awards; the award for Best Director and Best Beginner Director.
Another award winner of the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple's film about Joe Strummer, singer of Clash, took the award for Best Documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his performance as the driver of David Cronenberg, a thriller set in London, the Mafia boss of "Murder Promises".
Notorious for his roles as a tough guy, Ray Winstone received the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The fifty-year-old actor, whose name includes films "Scum", "Hungry Coppon" and "Sexy Dog", is currently involved in filming "Indiana Jones and the kingdom of crystal skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after his "Camelo" and "Harry Potter" star Harris, who died in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door," Winstone added.
"I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time and I appreciate him very much."
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include, for example, Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested in connection with terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia released yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested planning to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as several strikes on ecclesiastical persons and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
Supporters of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been acting as an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to television coverage, an eight-man cell led by a foreign resident planned to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
After an attempt to attack the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006, organized by Al-Qaeda, Saudi Arabia began building a rapid response force of 35,000 to protect the facilities.
According to a report quoting the words of the Home Secretary, 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "person specializing in rocket shootings" illegally crossing the national border.
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight rounds into the kingdom area.
Of the 22 detained, there were plans to assassinate church leaders and security forces.
The government has called for tougher action by church leaders to curb Saudis who join Al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who fight against Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government. The latter is considered heretic by Saudi hardline Sunni.
Al-Qaeda fighters view a significant number of Saudi Arabia church leaders as being involved by authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family in charge of the government.
The organization's fighters - encouraged by the call of Al-Qaeda Saudi-born leader Osama bin Laden to target the West-friendly Saudi government - aimed to attack settlements, government buildings and energy facilities with foreign residents.
"Security forces have made huge efforts over the past...five months," a Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-man "media cell" was also caught in Medina aimed at spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals supporting violence against Muslims branded as unfaithful and apostate.
The arrests also included 32 individuals accused of financial support for militants.
Venus’ climate can provide an insight into the Earth’s future
Scientists found yesterday that Venus could once provide pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet can be regarded as Earth's capricious twin more than we thought it would be before.
Venus is the closest planet neighbor on Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, billions of years ago, Venus could have had very similar living conditions and even habitable conditions.
However, due to the outstandingly high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and the planet's lower rotational speed, Venus entered a distinct developmental orbit.
Today, the water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, as well as being destroyed by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, based on the study of the planet for a year, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor at the Department of Physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Start to figure out why Venus' climate differs so much from that experienced on Earth despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar in structure.
"With our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario of Venus's development billions of years ago, when it could still have habitable conditions similar to Earth.
"enriched uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million (£480.000).
Wide Open Gates
According to Mitt Romney, he is not worthy of a candidate running for president to answer questions from a snowman.
Yet Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate televised on YouTube, under which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday night 28 November proved as ridiculous as those of the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the other party's debate televised on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected well the situation of the Republican party approaching next year's election.
It is not yet known how the CNN executives who co-financed the debate selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates precisely on what basis.
The longest issue covering the first half hour of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' braids.
CNN asked some uncertain voters to dial a number if they were to hear a flaunting thing: the mediator experienced excellent agreement when candidates spoke harshly on the question of borders.
The most lively and longest debate developed between Rudy Giuliani at the top of the national level and Romney advancing in the crucial primaries held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to change the image of him that during his mayorship in New York, he handled the issue of illegal immigration too lightly.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house by the former Massachusetts governor.
The word battle between the two became particularly intense when interviewers asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would ensure permanent status and the possibility of citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as those from California, Duncan Hunter and Colorado, managed to get into the subject thoroughly.
And although none of them are considered to stand a chance on the nomination, their stay on the race track may be explained by the fact that they began to ring the bell that sounded immigration earlier and louder than the others.
At least in the area of immigration, there is broad consensus between candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take hard action against illegal immigrants.
This theme, like the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors from the outside world, helps Republicans within their berks to forget or minimize the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other issues came to light, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani faced the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner asked if candidates would believe all the Bible’s words.
In this question, Giuliani stumbled and finally grasped the point of view that although he viewed the Bible as his favorite book, Jonah and the whale might not literally interpret the story.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who took the first place in the election in Iowa, who was responsible for his victory by his persistent Christian conservatism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but that it was necessary.
When asked whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for office.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's dynamic citation in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's fundraising action and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding him at the Wednesday debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a joint candidate among the more well-known and traditional principles representing aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who sounded in time and convincingly the victory message proclaiming the greatness of America and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences of this are unimaginable for the time being.
Labour pains
There's another gulf in front of Gordon Brown; the way out remains the same.
Compared to British political scandals, the current one doesn't seem too saucy.
No one has sold their honor, no politicians have found their hotel bills in Paris, no one has committed an extramarital scandal.
However, the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the name of others, had contributed covertly to the Labour Party governing Britain for more than four years with an amount exceeding £650,000 ($1.3 million), and that the party had not reported on this, is one of the things without which the ensnare Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when, with his statement - that the polls had not influenced the outcome of the decision - he thoughtlessly questioned the British' intellectual ability, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
Instead, however, as noted by Vince Cable, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats with increasingly witty comments, he transformed from once feared Brown Stalin into Mr. Bean.
A blunder to rescue a distressed bank called Northern Rock put regulatory weaknesses and lack of judgment in the crossfire.
Sick proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to join forces with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authority revealed an unimaginably high degree of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals instigated mutiny protesting the reduction of the army's budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence is a part-time occupation.
And now here are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour Party (formerly administrative leader), has resigned.
These accidents do not yet mean that Brown cannot turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians or trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is highly unlikely to be able to advance things, and may not remain in his post for a long time, the suspended unbelief is over: the civil servant faculty begins to leak, the cabinet ministers start briefings, the press looks for bad-tasting news; and the government begins to defend itself and will be unable to focus.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult position as, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood".
As much as you'd like to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, it was your right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax administration records, for example, are linked to decisions he made during Brown's Finance Ministership.
And while a prolonged investigation into Blair's missteps, such as the relationship between the "nobility for money" case and political party funding, did not directly participate, voters may rightly assume otherwise.
Although Brown's situation is really unpleasant, it's not as awkward as it looks.
Mistakes aren't as scary as the throats say.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
And compensation, however much pain it may entail, can be the creation of trends always promised by Stalin, who resides in Brown: reliable, solid and somewhat hard-handed governance.
For example, the fuss over political donation serves.
The turtleneck conjecture Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said that he did not want to reveal his good deed to the public.
Perhaps so, but it was not his responsibility to make the decision.
The law banning the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the public has the right to know who knocks at the gates of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams' action, however, was unaware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during interrogations; as will Jon Medleson, the Labour Party's foundation leader, who was informed of the confused donations in October.
To Brown, however, for the time being, there are no leads: there is no indication that he knew about these twists, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown's entry into office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half his duties.
Although he soon condemned the violation of the law committed by his party, he diluted his strength by using a familiar instrument; he commissioned the investigation of the case - for safety's sake - a committee under the leadership of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, "a lesson to learn" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation, the police are in charge.
In addition, Brown has other things to clean up, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee on administrative rules, which has been operating without a leader for six months, or the promotion of effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard hat Labour Party to cooperate with the Torik and break up with special financial relations associated with the associations - this would be a tough one for party loyal Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
According to surveys, Conservatives currently lead with a serious advantage; Brown has two years to win back voters behind him; the only way to achieve victory is impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second-market mortgage crisis threatening America's credit card market?
If blood gets in the water, it's natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is indisposed, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the credit card market loss could reach up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
The rate of write-offs showing both the rate of recoverable loans and the rate of default indicating the rate of late payments over 30 days has increased.
HSBC announced $1.4 billion in losses in the US consumption finance segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is premature.
The proportion of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The 3.89% late payment rate calculated by the credit rating agency Moody's for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the US rules on individual inability to pay in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of whistleblowers, while at the same time causing a large loss in the credit card market; a new increase in the number of bankruptcy claims (and thus the write-down rate) is expected, whether the total of the conditions for borrowing is deteriorating or not.
The payment rate, which shows the monthly rate of consumer credit repayment, is also solid on the market.
In addition, trust in credit card-backed securities is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup estimates that the emissions volume of 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers increase the debt on credit cards to repay housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers mainly monitor cash movements and not asset value, and therefore the fall in house prices does not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors may even benefit from the situation.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage, consumers will be less encouraged to repay credit; as a result, repayment of debts on credit cards will advance in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexible than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of a sudden re-price of assets.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up to completely reevaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is more likely.
If declining housing market prices and the decline in lending bring America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grim future.
It's worth monitoring those predatory fins.
British bankers pleaded guilty to the Enron case
On Wednesday, he confessed his guilt to the three British bankers who were tried to investigate their role in cheating on Enron's former financial director Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent of the seven-order fraud charge that they were believed to have collaborated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 that they wanted to make money at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
However, at a court hearing, before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each admitted to being guilty of uniform fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in Britain during the extradition process lasting two years.
The investigation into the case launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
First prosecution against them warned Fastow in 2002 that he was one of the targets of a government inquiry into Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers named "The Three of NatWest" were charged with travelling to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare the fraud along with Fastow and Michael Kopper, then the Fastow's right hand.
Fastow, responsible for planning countless frauds that bankrupt Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary into which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any stake in the subsidiary, but the three British men well knew that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's stake in the subsidiary of $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying a subsidiary stake worth $20 million from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million hit the grips of British bankers Fastow and others.
The prosecution says the bankers got $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others got $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his two counts of guilt due to his role in Enron's collapse.
The British Three was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States on bail worth $1 million each, where they reside during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest American company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after accounting tricks that had been applied for years could no longer cover the millions accumulated as debt or the companies that were shown to be profitable but actually loss-making.
Thousands of jobs were lost due to the collapse, with market value falling by over $60 billion and pension funds falling by over $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year of their complicity in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving over 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges imposed on Lay ended with the man's death last year.
No Poverty in Moscow
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine that will take the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption, with a tank.
However, for some Russian rich people, this amount is a small sum of money.
"It can accommodate 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, representative for Gulfstream.
"But no one assigns so many seats because machines are purchased for private families or corporate managers."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day, exclusive Millionaire Fair, which was held in the huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented stalls at the exhibition, hoping that Russian novices would be interested in everything, from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond coated 50 cents worth of cooling grids.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche exhibited on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's no match for our products," he said.
"Private aircraft after the United States have largest market in Russia".
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money like Dallas did in his prime during the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered here materialists," said Marshall Goldman, senior scholar of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian and Japanese gamblers of the 1970s and the 1990s, the Russians have now become the most spectacular spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold rush.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of richest people, there are 53 billion in Russia who have a total of $228 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who can own a total of $670 billion, was determined by a study carried out by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research analysing personal welfare development in the territory of the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005 the number of people living below the subsistence minimum in Russia was 15.8%.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative at the David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole attended the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed, and men are a real treasure mine."
Two real estate agents roaming the halls in evening gowns on Sunday night, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both themselves and their clients were credited as millionaires.
"I've looked at cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said young Yumatova, who brazenly rushed and spun in her custom-designed dress, as if she had already gotten used to this fuss.
The fair was primarily held for the new rich, for brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to go around a draughty, cifran-decorated venue after several hours in traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund plush bears at the same time.
For ordinary people, the ticket costs EUR 30 ($44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr Gijrath, who took a seat with patriotic consideration at the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, in contrast to a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue tile-painted Rembrandt imitation.
"Russians, of course, are more interested in striking things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the long-standing Russians (based on Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) had already moved from blatant logos to brands made in limited circulation that would not get into a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millions of agents, and tourists, filled the room every day to the full.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil Beds, said that he sold two mattresses worth $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate of A1 Moto, dealing with the modern alarming of high-quality cars, reported that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer who delivers solutions to individual needs, sold three grilles to Rolls-Royce Phantoms by Sunday afternoon. The bars resemble connected chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said Swarovski coated with crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skin and a picture of his wife's face made of a zirconium cube will not necessarily use these objects," said Karapetian.
"He'll keep them in his 30-40 car-guard garage."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege nowadays, given the rapid rise in property prices there.
"Whoever bought property in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely a millionaire today, if not in money, or at least on paper," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least create the appearance of wealth in front of the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style telephone booths that were stacked with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, and many of them had their cell phones take pictures of themselves lying around in a stack of money or just pocketing a few million.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Surgical malpractice suspected behind a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked on the flat glass window of a restaurant called "Just A Little healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Shortly thereafter, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr Livingston, an inspector working at the restaurant on Wednesday.
"By then, I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old, her name is Olga Arroyo, and she used to work as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Currently, the investigation is ongoing to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon not identified by the police working without permission at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the tox screen tests that will be available in a few weeks will shed light on this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to high-ranking Newark police.
Arroyo, voiced by many in the department, has worked as an assistant alongside police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and reliable," said McCarthy Arroyo in a Wednesday interview on the phone.
". He was my watchdog.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, who had previously worked as a Newark police officer, currently on the Committee on the Control of Spirit Products, and left behind two boys, 14 and an 11-year-old, as well as a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the investigators were working to find out if Mrs Arroyo had been the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's intervention.
"Fennal's probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. in November.
On the 21st and Mrs Arroyo was found on the couch.
He was already pronounced dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and the police have told very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro, for the time being.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro had been heard by the detectives.
The participants in the study are looking into whether part of the house has functioned as a doctor's office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a wilted rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the basement, in the driveway there was a blue tank marked "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks to side.
McCarthy recalled when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo was an invaluable help by helping her navigate the unusual and unbridled political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "You'd better be careful with this and that," he remembered.
"He was always here when I arrived this morning, and he was still in there when I left at night.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations to cut Fed interest lead to a storm in world stock markets
Stock prices jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the reassuring statements of the Deputy President of the Central Bank of America increased his hopes that Fed would try to ease investment opportunities by further cutting interest rates.
Share markets in both London and New York City and across Europe have stalled after Donald Kohn, who is the right hand of Fed President Ben Bernanke, stated that leaders must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the unrest that is constantly observed in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn's clear goal of calming down markets amid signs of the revitalizing credit crisis, he stated that the present unrest had "partially set back the progress made in the market in late September and October".
He said that if increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as Fed ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even further interest rate reductions in order to stabilise credit conditions.
Statements have also calmed Wall Street, which has recently been hit by more bad news affecting the American economy, such as the negative record of U.S. housing sales.
The side effect of the financial unrest was also confirmed by an announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns that it will lay off 650 workers and 4 percent of its global workforce as part of the cost reduction to offset losses in the US second-market housing loan sector.
The above measure concerns a total of 20 jobs at the London headquarters with 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and ended at 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2 and thereby increased the value of British blue-chip companies by over £39.
German Dax increased 2.6 percent while French CAC40 increased 2.3 percent.
The credit market turmoil was renewed after the three-month paper auction organised by the European Central Bank came to European banks at an unseen, 4.7 percent price since April 2001.
After the British interbank interest rate Libor reached the highest seen since September after a steady increase after November 12, 6.59 percent, the Bank of England was all under increased pressure to follow Fed and the ECB and to allow additional capital to the London financial market.
In England, they demand a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There were two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's gonna own the English team's field six in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision?
On the one hand, the latter question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors, who temporarily fulfills this particular task, assists the head coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in the decision, and on the other hand, because the branch of the English Executive Director Hugh Morris's desk is beginning to fill with requests for access to a national, or at least one-off sorting post.
Of the two players, the short draw is the one that does not get the sixth batting spot, but as is known, life, and especially sports, is often unfair.
It is never easy to say what makes a person reach the peak of their calling, while others can't even get past a lower level, often it depends on luck rather than talent.
It is not only cricket that it is difficult to choose - often on a subjective basis -.
Is the time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example, if, say, John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart young leaders with excellent qualifications, familiar with the business, were put before decision-makers, while there is only room for one of them.
Who can tell me what level a cricketer is supposed to be without being thrown into deep water in a major race?
Of course, the data greatly influence the decision, but the possibilities are equally important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's glance at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batsman must get a chance to become a big player on a regular basis once he wants to become a big player.
Catching the look of selectors is much more complicated.
For example, more than James Anderson played better last season, yet he is surely a team member in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's own saying that he is in good shape and he is doing very well with the punch.
Anderson fought his participation in the tour with 32 first-class gates with knockdowns and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them have had successful moments at the highest level and hope that they will continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can blow up or break anyone's career, but it may not have a particular impact on the future.
Four years ago Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played in every test and did well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet it was Paul Collingwood who emerged at the time and became a decisive test cricketer, who may still be underestimated today despite scoring double hundred points against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that in their discussion at Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, listening to their conservative intuitions Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will cast their vote for Shah's greater experience, against Bopara's young life force and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is in favour of his bright and successful debut in the districts of the '88 Bombay test, against the six of Bopara, who was seven years younger than him, 22 years old, who also scored 32 first-class hundreds in excellent twists.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran only ten in two quarters at home in the test at Lorda in May against the West Indies, as well as that Vaughan, who had been fighting for him for his re-enactment in the next game, had met the immediate resistance of the selectors, seems to have reduced the endurance in him, which was still clear in Bombay.
As opposed to him, Essex's universal talent is a life-joyed and unsurpassed player.
Nothing on the cricket court can upset him, but his off-field attitude was well characterized when he flipped over at an exhibition with a four-wheeler of the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
However, the first thing he did afterwards was to take Vodafone's phone (of course sponsored) into his hands and phoned his remotely watching teammate Alastair Cook to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better field player with classics. With his slippery medium steps, he creates an advantageous pitching angle, and his punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's the real art of selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara the chance right now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would give me prominence if, as the tea leaves in Ceylon suggest, he'd be the one playing this weekend.
Buses will take the refugees home to work and fight Al-Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived in Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have expired visas, or even those who hope that the city will be restored to order.
There are also those who have returned to fight the soldiers who have driven them away from their houses.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled dozens of buses arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sunni Doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I came back today because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the newspapers and that the city was now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the militia minister Moqtada al-Sadr, who has currently stopped his Shiite army.
The 38-year-old Shiite teacher Qassim al Atwani from Amariyah, predominantly inhabited by Sunni, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up work.
Amarijai's skit neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying with the help of troops supported by Americans, they managed to force Al-Qaeda out of their rook in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader to escape a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, North Baghdad, after he began encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had created an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of peace being strengthened in the capital since the entry of American troops and being lured home by armed civilian forces working with Americans.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voiced the widespread view among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to reject the refugees' visa application to force their return home.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have escaped death squads operating in the country.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government not to issue more visas for Iraqis, in order for them to move home," said Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I fled."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that Sunnis were driven away from the plains, while Shies also left Sunni - inhabited areas, resulting in a reduction in tension in many regions.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will upset the moods again, which may lead to further fighting.
Small Saarland - high-quality training
The smallest federal province has a leading role in professional training, and its higher education has an international orientation.
Only in one training area are Saarlanders struggling with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, I explained to a Saarland 50th time that we are not French" - this self-ironical slogan is advertised on his posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saarland education system, which can boast the fifth place based on surveys by the German Economic Institute of Cologne (IW).
In this way, higher education institutions work closely with neighbouring countries, even for the sake of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the percentage of foreign students is 15.6 percent higher.
However, the Saarland colleges and universities also have an above average attraction for those wishing to study in the Saar region - many of them have no secondary school education.
"In the Saar region, opportunities for professional training are being exploited", explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than a fifth of the youth gain further education in a vocational training school, making the Saarland more than the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combination of professional and higher education is well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies is ranked second within Germany in terms of population.
Despite practice-oriented training and increasing interest, however, the number of graduate engineers has declined by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education obliged higher education institutions to a marketing campaign focused on engineering.
"In elementary schools, we initiated a number of reforms following the first Pisa study," a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
For children to start studying earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. It is a model that in the meantime other federal provinces have begun to copy.
Whether the performance of pupils will continue to improve will only be answered by future comparative studies.
Based on the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the proportion of students at risk shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saar region did not improve as much as that of the other Lands.
Bavarians count better.
To the greatest annoyance of Saarlanders, foreign language knowledge would not be taken into account in the Pisa survey - otherwise they would otherwise be able to reap laurels in this area,
Because the language of the neighbouring countries in high schools is a mandatory subject - even if Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez Resets Hours
In Venezuela, classes will be different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn back time meters in the Latin American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laughing stock in Spain.
As stated in Venezuela's official paper, a new law states that clocks will be turned back four-and-a-half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
The anti-U.S. Chávez justified its decision by, among other things, the fact that time zones based on whole hours were forced into the world by the United States.
Chávez also announced an interruption in relations with neighbouring Colombia on Wednesday (local time) due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain contact with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this either because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who is calling for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must give their opinion on Sunday within the framework of a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly build its power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe, with his decision, "spitted in the face" Venezuela, voiced his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new mobile ringing sound has attracted attention: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up), that's the sentence that over half a million people have already downloaded for themselves from the Internet.
The sentence comes from Charles John, King of Spain, who was so upset at the last Latin America summit by the constant interruptions of the populist politician in Balolda that he cut into its word.
In 2007, the German people are under threat of wage decline.
One forecast is that German workers are facing a real wage reduction this year despite strong economic activity.
Experts supported their pessimistic prediction with a lot of reasons.
According to Hans-Bröckler-Foundation calculations, in 2007 employees can actually expect less pay than the previous year.
"It is this modest wage development, the increase in the general sales tax, and the rapid increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research to the "Bild" daily newspaper.
Workers may also face additional burdens in terms of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stated in his statement to the daily newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that reducing the current situation of correct and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the start of the new year.
In any event, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply to the alliance for credit or support, a politician of the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, has been quoted.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is Earth's evil twin
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than has been assumed to be: In its atmosphere, the European space probe "Venus Express" discovered lightning discharges, and in its polar circles wind vortexes such as those produced on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have speculated that Venus is being lightningd.
The European space probe "Venus Express" provided evidence - discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: Lightnings on Venus spread from cloud to cloud at an elevation of around 56 kilometers, reporting on the columns of scientific magazine "Nature" by Christpher Russel of California University, Los Angeles.
According to the famous "ancient soup theory", the formation of Earth life was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms started reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington, D.C.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is roundly 100 times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be a hell of a twin brother on Earth, but it's still his twin brother," Russell pointed out.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus is so similar in mass and size to Earth on a completely different development path.
The November 2005 start of "Venus Express" was a milestone in Venus research because no probe has been on the road specifically since the early nineties to search for this planet.
The latest research results already presented in several "Nature" articles are not just proof of the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to researchers.
"They also point out that the similarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we first assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known North Pole whirlwind, researchers also discovered an even faster moving cloud vortex in the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the winter hemisphere of the Earth, says the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian institute Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second innermost planet in the solar system is almost the same as that of Earth, and with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers, it is almost the size of Earth.
The celestial body, also called the Evening Star, bypasses the sun in less than 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own wheel: a Venus Day lasts 243 earthly days.
Although Venus' surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with 92 bar pressure, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets originated under similar conditions.
Both had water pooled up, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus he left for the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth was bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus, this is a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands the end of the dispute between the parties that erupted around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor following the reception in September.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the Grand Coalition to end the controversy surrounding the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not appear as a divided nation on this issue to the outside world," Köhler told Handelsblatt paper.
Köhler simultaneously expressed his understanding of the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel(CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are universally valid to me even if I respect the diversity between cultures", underlined Köhler.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, the President of the Republic stressed; however, he defended Merkel against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"Federal chancellor did not break up with traditional 'one China' policy".
China is aware of this," stated Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier(SPD) has indirectly voiced his displeasure with the reception of the Dalai Lama and has therefore become the target of attacks in the Union ranks.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "kirakat policy" in the foreign policy field.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama at the chancellor's office, intense disturbances occurred in the German-Chinese affair.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only rescinded the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL's information.
Chinese head of state Wen Jiabao now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to receive the Dalai Lama.
China rejects when European politicians receive the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama pointed out that it was trying to break further Tibetan territories including Tibet and other provinces today.
Schäuble protects against riots like those in France
Street clashes with police, shots, flaming cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not result in street violence, is demanded by the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades were on fire, raiders fired shotguns at police officers: After serious riots by young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears similar developments.
"We must ensure that the social explosives do not accumulate or become violent in our country.
We need to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people adjust in the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problematic cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, first successes are already evident."
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble at the same time referred to the absence of urban architecture and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, youths fought heavy street fighting with police.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
Against this background, the Federal Government has been called upon by Kenan Kolat, the leader of the Turkish Communities of Germany, for greater activity in terms of integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "threats of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
Still, action is necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families was "higher than the average".
Above all, more education places should be provided.
Kolat stressed, "We must provide a perspective for young people."
However, the leader of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to ruin what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "We must nevertheless be on guard."
Young people "should be given the opportunity to have a job and receive education as quickly as possible".
Meanwhile, in the suburb of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was a complete calm during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to deploy, a helicopter with a headlight canvassing the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests as well as some flaming garbage cans and cars.
Since reporting, a round 1,000-person safety unit has ensured calmness.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, announced by Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie following her visit to the suburbs.
During the night that dawned on Tuesday, 80 police officers were roundly wounded as a result of the riots in Villiers-Le-bel.
The following night the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots broke out in connection with a traffic accident during which two youths were killed on Sunday.
According to the state's attorney's office's first findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Cloudwalker in Angela's realm
The chancellor's farce of reality is proof that the coalition is ending - and nothing is expected of him.
What country does the federal chancellor actually live in?
Following its bleak, indifferent and meaningless action at the Bundestag's general debate, it must be stated: he does not live here - he does not live in the country whose governance is his responsibility.
She rejected the charge with a very superior sentence by Angela Merkel that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how apprehensive the reproaches were.
Meanwhile, no specific interest or empathy was felt towards the country's problems.
Instead, Cloudwalker Angela emerged: a politician who fled from a reality who fled into foreign policy and there was only uncertainty his own.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendammi praises himself for the decisions, but he is silent about how climate change goals should be achieved in the country.
At all, as far as self-praise is concerned - such modesty would not have been allowed by the President of the CDU two years earlier.
He now clings to the phrase that prosperity produces a positive effect from people.
This harms his reputation as a pragmatic personality who solves problems instead of word flowers.
However, in the realm of cloud-walking Angela, domestic policy problems are just incidental.
Child poverty and low income problems?
He deserves only a few half sentences.
In this regard, how often he slips tongues when it comes to family benefits.
Merkel has to jump in three times to make a half-baked sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he wanders in foreign territory.
Seizure Division
During the Republican presidential candidates' debate on Youtube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard blow change - and now they must also fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced in connection with the first subject.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani of making New York a "past resort to illegal immigrants".
Who, on his own part, is in control with serious facts: "I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants", he strikes back Giuliani, and throws it up to the former governor of Massachusetts that he employed immigrants without documents as private people.
Candidates are going into a fit: As the Republican camp still does not have a unifiedly supported favourite, the eight presidential forwards use the debate on CNN above all to undermine its opponent's credit.
Private 30-second videos sent by Internet users via Youtube are little more than brief summaries.
"With this type of isolationism, we put Hitler in power," rubs John McCain under the nose of his opponent Ron Paul, who demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only participant in the circle.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by the veteran who walked Vietnam when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding" as torture, the interrogation method in which drowning is simulated.
That the important topics of the campaign, meanwhile, are only beyond Iraq and the debates on torture, is shown by the reactions of the audience of St. Petersburg, Florida.
Loud applause breaks out in the room when praising conservative values and rejecting future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming increasingly apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney repentantly says and apologizes to supporters and television viewers for having cast his vote in 1994 in favor of abortion.
Giuliani, on the other hand, wavers when she is asked for her opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
One day after his withdrawal from the head of the army, Musharraf was sworn in as President exercising power in Pakistan.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The oath of President of Pakistan to Pervez Musharraf for a further five-year term of office took place on Thursday.
Pakistani television from the capital, the presidential palace in Islamabad, broadcast the ceremony live.
Musharraf swore by the Constitution and that he would act for the benefit of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus yielded to international pressure from the United States above all.
The former general now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state eight years after his break into power without bloodshed, in the form of a military coup.
With Musharraf's withdrawal as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, he met a fundamental demand from the West and the Opposition.
Another important demand is the termination of the state of emergency, which Musharraf announced on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf terminates the state of emergency shortly after his swearing-in, by which he fulfills a further demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, in which Musharraf planted lawyers sympathetic to him at the beginning of November following the state of emergency, rejected all protests over the past week regarding the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more injured as a result of an assassination of a military convoy in the tribal area in the north, northern Waziristan.
According to information provided by an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Fathers of the Krautrock return
The German Super Team of the Seventies is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia dusted their instrument again for a concert in Berlin.
At the time of the reunion, a cut recording appears from their heyday, the time of "Live 1974".
They were better known abroad at that time.
The announced sensation is embodied in the person of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Each before his own instrument, his own cable and, above all, his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, with his 63 years in a white shirt, sits in the middle.
From the left, Michael Rother, a young man of 57 years, offers an escort in possession of a laptop and guitar.
Viewed from the audience from the right, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curls and concentrates on the console.
Each of them makes some kind of noise, but also a rhythm once in a while.
All of this sometimes coincidentally coincides with traditional music.
However, all this does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves particularly.
It was a great thrill for lovers of the krautrock music direction that the Harmonia band was playing again.
What we can tell here: As a result of proper follow-up, we can determine that the name has passed through the collective pop memory, but by no means left such lasting traces that we miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why shouldn't the Germans celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
Especially since what we call misleadingly krautrock has always been more appreciated in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement to still alive members of the Cologne Can band in 2003, the figures of German pop sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When he thanked even the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudation of Red Hot Chili Peppers, the amazement became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother then sat on stage as an old friend with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overloaded by Harmonia only because the trio only existed for two years, and during that time it had far less impact than others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They initially played in the basement under the theatre Schaubühne in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a church-funded record company.
Rother briefly helped the Kraftwerk band, and in parallel, he gained a reputation as a guitarist for the then perhaps most radical German band Neu!
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians into their exile at Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th-century Rom city as a communist who fled.
Less ideologized than in the First Commune, where Roedelius was still working as a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic artistry.
It is said that out of the garbage came the songboard flag of Harmonia Ottenstein and in this way they found a name for their art.
Some of these things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album is called "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band suffered financial need.
The collection of money alone did not provide for self-conflict.
The CD released under the title "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert held in Griessem, in front of a record audience of just under 50, so someone remembers.
Forced Harmonia and occasional practice at the time was Rother's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The gang announced its dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up at esoterics and maintained himself from albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the eighties, which has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album from Grissem is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, who was named Greenland, set out to take care of the krautrock as a specific German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! was dug up as well as Roedelius' solo creation.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the Berlin House of Culture.
Public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of the British ancestor and the manual "Krautrock Sampler", is also present.
Also present is Loveparade's idea maker, Dr. Motte.
All of this roughly outlines the impact of the krautrock on the upcoming pop music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's finding floats along with the most unusual voices in the room: "The only true music, he owns the future."
There are some pictures depicting the producer with Harmonia in a farmhouse room.
The screening of further black and white photographs of the tangled cabled equipment serves the building of legend.
In the lobby, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
This merely means that microphones are attached to the organ and drum equipment with the intention of attracting unheard sound effects from instruments themselves using devices that produce escapitated sound effects.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three tech-enhanced DIYers.
Even the house choir doesn't change anything.
Under the command of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and whisper, and sing "Aaaaaaah!" with a sense of a beautiful part.
After all, Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in musical arts colleges (Can), technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or just in escaping artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "'68!", they're not on a completely wrong path, and Harmonia still doesn't let themselves get out of control.
Even the most self-evident thing is carefully thought out on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can lead to a nervous upheaval, or to the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
Through "Hunting" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films again deal with the Balkan War.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too focused on action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere can't help you with "Hunting."
First of all, although the two war criminals Karajich and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor Richard Gere again there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War.
In recent times, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, as his many good-boy-speaking roles in emotional films for women and the many press conferences on Buddhism have even discouraged us from looking at him.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most pressing argument for perhaps watching the movie "Hunting."
It provides a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the war correspondent Simon Hunt, which he formed, is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so gracious to him: A man who had long since left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline still preserved a significant part of his former appeal as a ruinous monument.
However, the film "Hunting" and also this week began to screen German "Mörderischer Frieden" production, despite this trump card, continues only an endless series of failed films about the Balkan War.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" doesn't have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her as an encore.
Although it is to be welcomed that for once Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film carrying the shallowness of TV films is lost too quickly in the shooting and eventful scenes.
"Cobra carries 11" character - with war instead of highway.
On the other hand, in the case of "Hunting", it can be seen as an example, why no really good film has actually been made about the Balkan War.
The story of the three United States war correspondents who are rounding up to seek out the Serbian war chief criminal named "Fox", with another director, another screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's Personal Faluno) in a different era might have become a new "Apocalypse now".
After all, the stories show a surprising resemblance: In both cases, small groups set off into the forest to accomplish what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the journey to madness is taking place.
One of the reasons for the downfall of "Hunting" is that it simply does not allow Simon Hunt to be the depraved cynic listening to his heart as he introduces him at the beginning.
No, and as an encore in the script, he even spends a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"Hunting" slips away permanently when reporters reach what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the last five minutes of the film were unable to do in five years: they capture the war criminal and then hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for a just revenge.
It's so bad that you want to go to the Hague International Tribunal for a crime against cinema logic.
But the purpose of the film is profoundly human.
He intends to pelt that Karajich and Mladics are still at large and suspect the Americans and the French (in this they are still said to be exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough due to secret political deals.
But good and evil sometimes resemble each other so much that one can think of a famous Brecht poem.
In this, the poet writes of the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I stare with regret at the bulging blood vessel at his temple, which tells me how tiring it is to be bad".
Movies such as "Hunting" have masks in the same oversized, human-head shape, which, however, show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were ugly failures.
We can add: We haven't found any good films about South Africa yet.
Almost always valid: If a star roams the world's crisis goals or minefields, it will result in something like "On the Paths of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "Without Hatars" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in terms of time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to shoot a good movie about the Holocaust with the movie "Schindler's List".
Probably some films are still worth it - since the works on the Vietnam War, now classic, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But it is possible that today, when each mass murder arrives at our home in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives screenwriters of ignoring reality, which would be necessary to tell good stories.
After all, the reason Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime really was is because they didn't know how bad it was.
Maybe you shouldn't strive for good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to find ourselves in the sarcastically distant artistic vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprière-lexikon" and the Balkan War, he replied, "It depends only on how certain things never change.
The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is fiercely criticized for the Olympics' resignation
The mayor's demarcation from Hamburg's bid to host the Summer Olympic Games sparked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue to fight for the organisation of water games.
However, Von Beust strongly warns of realities during the odds.
The Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief executive Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz rated the retirement as "unfavorable to the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently unleashed such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, we cannot keep the momentum of sport policy even."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "that starts from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust persisted in his earlier statements that Hamburg's ambitions for the Olympic Games were not realistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides the Olympic competition, it's the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Association's decision expected for early December about the tender submitted in Munich for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"To give this priority to us means that within the period we have thought of up to 2028, we will not have realistic chances."
Nevertheless, we will not give up the dream forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret over von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It's too early to shoot away an opportunity by burying our plans already," said Günter Ploß, president of HSB on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception at the General German College Sports Association General Assembly.
There, the tender for the 2015 Universiade for Von Beust Hamburg, described it as not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg as the town participating in the competition last week.
The civilian faction of the SPD accused the Senate of leaving valuable time unused in terms of housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted alongside the Olympics and ignored housing construction," said two SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quas.
While the SPD constantly broke a spear in favour of an integrated plan for Olympic and subsequent housing use in relation to Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally placed emphasis on the "event factor".
The tender for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the time sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Nevertheless, Hamburg fell in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
The one who links Sweden and wooden crate concepts to each other means Ikea and not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Wood crates currently manufactured in Sweden cast a dark shadow on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box listed in this one is fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" challenged the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, now the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stockholm has come to a sobering conclusion: Most of the six "Brillo Box" copies donated to Moderna Museet by Pontus Hultén, former museum director in 1995 - and most likely also a hundred more "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxes on the international art market.
The prehistory is a confusing chain of long and complicated artistic and board stunts.
Warhol created first "Brillo Boxai" in New York City in 1964 - painted wooden crates based on a red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of "Brillo" soap powder.
At an exhibition of his works held in Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were exhibited: These (for cost savings reasons) were not from Warhol, but were transported directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It wasn't about artwork, it was about their templates, simple exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which, however, were not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time are now talking round about fifteen crates that were then certified Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm-type" rightfully entered art and auction history.
Some were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wooden crates were produced and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 crates were not manufactured until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in Saint Petersburg.
At this time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the main memorial administrator at Moderna Museet, examined three Swedish privately owned boxes in addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first laid down and sanded, after which the white oil paint was brushed up.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, shows that the paint was carried directly onto the chipboard with a painting cylinder, without foundation - and it is not even oil, but acrylic paint.
"These crates were not certified by the artist, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless otherwise decided by the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board', Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Of course, the Authentication Board announced as early as June that it would investigate "serious accusations" raised in connection with soap dust crates.
Since then, however, they have been entrenched in relentless silence.
Manila rebel soldiers give up
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, he told reporters at the hotel their leader, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to this, government loyal soldiers using tear gas stormed the hotel.
Two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday for the coup attempt that failed in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly release a wheel with 30 sympathisers.
The military police responsible for guarding the man obviously switched sides with him and joined the mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and then demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government loyal units have sealed off the vicinity of the upscale hotel.
The chairwoman has called the security cabinet for an emergency meeting.
Security consultant Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' proceedings.
"People are sick of it," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously commanded the Scout Rangers elite, stated that other units in the army wanted to join the march within a short period of time.
The critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president by Friday.
His government has been overshadowed by corruption charges for several months.
As early as 2003, Manila's financial district was the main scene of his attempt to mutiny against Arroyo, organized roundly by 200 members of the army.
The uprising failed after less than 24 hours when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, at least seven coup attempts have been made in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.

United Internet provided itself with more than 20 percent stake in Versatel telecommunications company.
As stated by the company on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14,46 Euro.
This represents 20.05 percent ownership of the core capital.
There were speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of raising ownership in Versatel remains open.
This step is to help consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet said.
As early as Wednesday, assumptions were given to wing a possible involvement after Berenberg Bank raised its stake in the Düsseldorf network provider to an additional 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution only maintains the stake to a third party, it is rumoured in the money market.
On the previous day, United Internet already owned a narrow 10 percent of Drillisch's mobile phone company.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch posted 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
Of this, United Internet purchased 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a spokesperson for United-Internet.
The two companies jointly founded the MSP joint venture to take over the competing Freenet.
In the beginning, the two companies are satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies leave all options open, in particular with regard to the increase in their shareholding in Freenet AG, the news goes out.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet, which has been around for months, is now part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile phone customers, as well as 1.27 million customers with DSL and landline access.
To date, United Internet and the holding company created by Drillisch had a directly 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Now we have an agreement that Drillisch will bring in an additional round four percent.
The right to purchase 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
