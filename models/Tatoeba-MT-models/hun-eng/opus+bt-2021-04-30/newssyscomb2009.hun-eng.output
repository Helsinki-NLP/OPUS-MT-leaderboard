Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, totalling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of the two parties of the so far Great Coalition and a significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties were brought, according to the first preliminary results, by the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖPP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the provincial magistrate of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a winning return to national politics.
Based on preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it lost 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the vote by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in Austria's post-war history so far, and especially in the People's Party that has brought about early elections, the result is literally disastrous.
In early July, upon leaving the ÖVP coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage before the SPÖ according to polls.
However, the electorate apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
As early as the first reactions to the results, speculation has been expressed about the possible resignation of party president Wilhelm Molterer and current vice chancellor.
Observers believe that this could take place as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate the ever more likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP Grand Coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously obtained 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - however, the Social Democrats expressed their fear of a repeat of the year 1999 when the People's Party agreed on joint governance with the populists (the FPÖ was united at the time, deposed from the BZÖ in 2005) which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume he can return to Vienna for national politics, is obviously expecting this solution.
The Greens Party also reached parliament, which, however, lost somewhat of its popularity, and fell from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four-percent limit and did not make it to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can get cold
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal bug collection could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that some estrangement could occur in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister published this in New York City after Pranab met Mukherji, his Indian partner, today.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, a certain estrangement would occur," he stated after the meeting, which took place on a Czech incentive.
Mukherji said after the trial that it was difficult for the executive authority to intervene in court matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, to which the case belongs.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
However, for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji believes it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then you could apply for bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole case, providing "competent legal support" to the convict, was mentioned by the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party had already provided such assistance.
"Our main interest with India is to preserve the best relations with many years of tradition.
This is acknowledged by the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scholars to be a serious mistake," he stated.
The question of whether he had been promised to deal with the matter from the Indian side was ignored by the Minister.
"I've already received relatively many promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It steps to the wall electronic map showing Australia and adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
During the area, it is the size of the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member group of United Nations Division's ocean and maritime law affairs.
His boss, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which he sometimes complements.
There's a boost and enthusiasm here.
The seabed contains a world rich in natural resources, so far scarcely known.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but so far there are also unknown living organisms that may be the key to developing an anticancer medicine, for example.
Seabeds larger than land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new subsea areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, they assert their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily an area of the so-called continental pedestal, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of that country.
Such a country has the exclusive right, under the Convention, to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified, we keep that part of the continental pedestal and the bottom layer of the seabed, which is a natural continuation of the subsea continent.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles, so-called exclusively economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application, which is submitted by the country to the Commission which designates the external borders of the Continental shelf, should be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and professional-technical assistance to the committee.
The committee has so far discussed five requests, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three mentioned countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its subsea country, has recently attracted an echo in the world.
But New Zealand has also won - the seabed area awarded to it by the committee is approximately 1.6 million square kilometers, or six times larger than the country's territory.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits from future use of the seabed are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly filing applications.
They can do so within ten years of the moment of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental pedestal ends, the area of the ocean bottom declared by the Convention as a "common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right to extract in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating by saying that "some areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contracted".
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares this with other countries of the former Eastern bloc as part of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
This organization was granted the so-called "piercing investor" status under the Convention in 1991, like investors from some other countries.
It is entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area inspected by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's a subsea replica of the Tatras.
"It can be extracted in a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetalic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese," is mentioned by another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, of the division's Macedonian staff, presents another example of a concrecy.
It reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy of parchment with magic words bringing Golem back to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage release
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis - and the professionals came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces were ready, but their deployment did not take place.
More and more details about the rescue of the eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are emerging.
The rescue operation was also indirectly attended by German special forces, according to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
According to this, in addition to the German Federal Army experts, GSG 9, staff of the German Federal Police Air Force, and the Federal Bureau of Crime, as well as logistics experts from the German Technical Service, were at the scene of the rescue.
According to information from ministry spokespersons Monday night, German forces were nevertheless not needed, as hostage takers allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany in order to involve it as an on-site support force.
" Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman, and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on September 19.
Following the kidnapping in the South Egyptian desert area, the hostages were carried back and forth in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained unclear, as have the details of the rescue of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the escaped arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
For the time being, no information has been provided in Berlin as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the daily "Bild", the five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the German Air Forces Airbus plane.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. House of Commons, by a small majority, failed the $700 billion bailout package proposed for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets by 227 votes to 206 in favour.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program was not given a majority to curb the chaos that dominated the financial markets.
Supporters desperately attempted to convince critics in a dramatic action of the need for a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic party's trial leaders, called on the representatives to support him, even if the plan was still unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
While still voting, Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent and 600 points respectively.
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, so that it would fall again after a failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Directors register more and more bookings.
Good winter for German tour operators.
According to one study, the turnover of travel reservations for the following months increased significantly compared to the previous year - more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite poor cyclical prospects, the Germans' sense of travel was not slowed down according to the study.
During winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year's period, said the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was roughly 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates monthly booking data for 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the full market.
The institute took into account travels booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travels to the US were particularly sought after, said DRV.
Here, the volume of reservations has increased by a third.
The German destinations are also particularly popular in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in the domestic landscapes.
Most of all, organized roads were looking for me, said Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs for organised roads are "better calculated for passengers than for individually organised journeys."
Among other things, passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, added Laepple.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so there will be another increase in traffic compared to the previous year - although another study shows that fewer German tourists have taken a trip compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Pauselessly repetitive ballermann hits, literated pint beers and celebrity wearing a design direction.
debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I aren't really much alike.
She's a blonde, TV host, and she's wearing a tailor-made direction.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the shop.
However, one thing connects us: We've been on Wiesn for just three minutes, we're already being raided by photographers and filled with their memory cards - I'm very flattered, and all this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how we make friends.
It seems that the cheap director will meet his purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist native to the north of the equator trained in white sausage, my sense of comfort is still bounded by folk costumes.
But when you arrive at Theresienwiese, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears a dirndli or leather pants; no one looks reluctant or awkward - everything is absolutely fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand are just a gift from my Dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich warns me that I tied the apron wrong: "You're free to the left, virgin in the middle, sold right, widow in the back."
I secretly tied the bow from behind to the left.
"That's good," he says, and he laughs.
Others make less fuss about fine flirty techniques and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and unsolicited to show their naked butts.
The young man with exhibitionist features is called Bob and also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, stretching the "aaaaaaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after he gets rid of the contents of his previously-drinked jar.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants everyone sees as garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the notorious "no-no-urinators."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics will be marching through the scene, taking care of the poor ones.
Patient nurses always show up in a team - four at a time carrying a covered gurney from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure stuffed.
Who's lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarp can't be seen.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the corpsmen shouts to me at my question and then in the rush.
Police have named the victim of the accident
Police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died at the hospital.
With Brentwood resident Chelmsford Road resident Carole Paulson, the accident occurred Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road, in the city.
She was taken to a hospital called Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the fallen imperial endeavor.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with a tower each at the front corner, and looks like some kind of German country town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's going down a little bit.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious how large-scale an enterprise has had this westernmost gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "later future" of the conquests, intended to achieve its ambitions for occupying the Middle East through this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to what is now Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railway lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
Relative isolation from surrounding regions, caused by frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and displaced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station was no better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the nicely crafted roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly fallen to ruin, and history has gone well beyond.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire Eastern region, it serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey, at least in a symbolic sense.
The Justice and Development Party on the government - the AKP - has developed an entirely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding regions, caused by frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran, and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the night train to Ankara, Turkish capital, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish Member of Parliament, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of buzzing, which at the time also gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary film "The Night Mail" about the old world, I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the ottom.
However, the AKP, known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This created some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern building of stone and steel, specially designed for this purpose - standing in a developing suburban district, between semi-finished shopping centers and coffee houses. In the latter, middle managers in suits - both men and women - meet to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have fit a right-to-middle-oriented politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open it both ways.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he'll be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted a choice."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here almost mechanically repeated: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea benefit Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
It is as if they are trying to convey the message that, figuratively, together with Turkey, the whole of Europe can go to Asia and the Middle East on those eastbound railway lines.
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, the two German gentlemen who watched the recovery of this fancy structure 100 years ago.
How they would have wondered if they would have learned that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I was waiting at the port for the ferry to take me back through the Bosporus, it occurred to me that Turkey was once called "the sick man of Europe."
At least at the time, there was no question of which continent to claim this exciting country.
Memorable Ways of Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as the musical director of Guildford, Vernon "Tod" Handley (an obituary, Sep 11) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the part of town, he founded his wonderful youth choir Proteus the following year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang their finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape changer) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music they put before it - whether it is madrigal or a Messiaen piece; without accompaniment, or with a large orchestral accompaniment.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and it was thanks to the man whose inspiration we had for our enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the sheet music.
So sing it!"
His conductorial technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerating.
Whatever the level of music was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If there was ever an arm leader who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with him during the two decades during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty years, I've written reviews of more than 100 concerts, but it's never, ever disappointed me, and it's often exhilarated me with them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated arm leaders who, in his words, simply "gallled with one or two well-known battlehorses throughout the world."
A lot of us are gonna miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary William Woodruff (September 25), "he continued his studies in economic history at Oxford in 1946 and became a Fellow of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950... while he was constantly preparing to obtain his bachelor's degree, master's degree and PhD title."
This comes from the authors' notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but is wrong.
He taught economic history at the University of Nottingham between 1946 and 1953, and, meanwhile, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950–51, he was indeed in the U.S. on a Houblon–Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at universities in Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
There's no telling why Woodruff was embellishing this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Humanities
"J. Vicente Resino's exhibition 'Flamenco and Life?' is recommended because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are impressive.
My attention was drawn to the simplicity and strength that flowed from them, as well as to the people in the photographs.
This exhibition is filled with emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second-time sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation Jazz.
True, its predecessor had a large enough passenger space, but the design of the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
This is coupled with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although very similar to his predecessor in the sight of the new Jazz, many internal changes were made to him.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to the detailed presentation of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less known in Europe, it is breaking sales records in other markets.
Such a market was Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and again this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since its entry into the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million examples sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants to continue to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 estimates target the sale of 100,000 cars, resulting in an increase of 17% on the European market.
In the Spanish market since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazzes, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary calculate 2000 examples sold over a period of one year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda's turnover in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 less than the 2007 figures, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite the terms of sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door and compact-sized hybrid - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would market 200,000 units worldwide annually.
According to the Japanese producer, the United States would account for 50% of Insight's market share, while the remainder would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial introduction is due after the official Valencian show scheduled for January, during the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz became more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3,900 mm (five inches longer), its width 1690 mm (two inches wider) and the wheelbase increased five inches, i.e. 2,500 mm.
Its height, however, remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment became more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new body and by the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the total cargo area of the so-called double floor trunk has increased, currently 399 litres, or 19 litres above the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes that the said dimensions apply to the type with the 1.4 engine, since the 1.2 Honda Jazz trunk is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as rear ledes lamps or optional panorama glass roofs, and easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the aperture angle of the doors to the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the first Jazz at 67 degrees.
The second generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model can be ordered with two 1.2 and 1.4 liters engines.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model and is characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2 litre resource has a power of 90 horsepower at a speed of 6000 and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at a turn of 4900.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and has a CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and has an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
The collision-avoiding "bee car"
For the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan this time drew inspiration from nature, precisely the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents by imitating bees' flyers.
An instrument called Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing impact prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center, in collaboration with the renowned Tokyo University's Advanced Research and Technology Research Centre, built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research and Development Brands, defined BR23C as an additional extension of Nissan's four-tier security shell.
The robot improves the ability of the company's products to avoid collision.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
However, more important is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it can see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in each direction. Consequently, the uterus can fly undisturbed in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers designed a so-called laser telemeter (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres in a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an action to avoid collision.
"As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot, mimicking the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a lower or greater angle to avoid collision.
The system is mostly distinguished from the instruments currently available by the fact that in this case the avoidance manoeuvre is carried out entirely automatically.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
In a manner other than bees, the bypass maneuver shall not be directed upwards or downwards, or diagonally, but shall only move in two dimensions and shall only move towards the rotation of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and manner, as is the case with bees.
Therefore, Nissan used a rotation function in addition to acceleration and slowing in the robot to avoid collisions.
"This device only has to process and react to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can operate without interruption with just a few dozen KB memories.
This may sound surprising, but we're not even talking about memories the size of a gigabyte, but we're not even talking about memories the size of a megabyte.
This is the first step in developing immediate collision prevention technology that Nissan estimates can enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be an additional option to reach the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the Treasury Department of the United States, apart from having a lot of investable cash, has no lack of common sense.
Since the crisis is upon them, and so that the Americans do not become entangled in the mazes of questionable solvency mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative net game called the "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the hotel for bad loans... or the trouble.
The sad face of the hotel, and especially the receptionist, suggests that we consider once more, twice, and even three times, whether it is really the time to borrow.
And especially where to apply for credit, since that is probably the purpose of the matter.
The information on the website is really useful, but it is not detailed.
It's for teenagers rather than the general public.
But what would happen if we added to the game?
For example, the hotel would show up in our dream room.
Actually, that's something, 'cause we can't even dream of buying a place.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a stake in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley shares' exchange rate has fallen heavily on the stock market.
A week after the prior agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion in total.
The agreed price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities that provide it with a 10% return, and their exchange rate is $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average price of $29 which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's share price dropped by 6.79% in Greenwich by around 17 p.m. and ended at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up its transformation into a banking company," explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, by which it can diversify its activities, while at the same time under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis demands even greater caution from corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
By the way, the terms announced on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought the stake would consist entirely of ordinary shares," explained Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and prevent possible risks."
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the yield per share is reduced by about 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares after one year if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. it rises to around $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that it can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources using funds from MUFG.
However, the group's spokesperson did not want to give accurate information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the association of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had improved "definitely" since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as its stock price has fallen by half, while the cost of its insurance against default risk has skyrocketed.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Only one "survivor" of the large investor banks remained following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, a Goldman Sachs that announced last week that he had made $15 billion: some of this came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group of companies.
Rafael Correa's Monday statement, Quito
Rebuilding the Republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan for Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the pattern of fellow presidents and friends on Sunday, Correa explained her ideas about the new constitution.
He successfully completed his mission, as 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum according to official results, which concerned 80% of the vote.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the vote was invalid, while 0.7% were unfilled by voters.
The adoption of the draft constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two surveys conducted at the exit of the polling offices and a census by a civil society organization both proved the vast superiority of the "yes" votes with a ratio of 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, talked about the victory of his draft constitution as early as Sunday to Monday night.
"The Constitution has won an overwhelming victory," he stated, and thanked the Ecuadorians at his seat in Guayaquil, Governor, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report from the OAS surveillance mission, the vote was held in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" defended by the President.
The proposed constitution places state power in the service of the economy, maintaining the right of the state to "design development" for a country that essentially lives from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by emigrators.
The draft Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also confirms the power of the head of state, who can obtain seats for up to two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolve the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again for the head of state mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also included the freeness of health services and education. The President had already started to introduce it in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants, and half the population lives below the subsistence minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end Quito and Washington's agreement to use the Ecuadorian facility as a basis for US anti-drug measures.
They freed 19 hostages in Chad.
Egyptian commando ambushed the kidnappers who took eleven tourists and their eight escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad during the morning by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at al-Maza military base at around 2:30 p.m., which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to make a statement to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo's suburban residential area, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers were "not paid a ransom," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in an SUV safari. The group was then carried from one hiding place to another by the 35 unknown hostage takers.
The group had 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and director of the safari organizer Aegyptous travel agency.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special commando arrived on two helicopters at the scene where the hostage takers were ambushed just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," claimed the leader who requested his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Lightning Brigade in Egypt to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, just in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must acknowledge that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and action groups," he stated, without further details.
He also denied that the hostages were being ransomed.
The day before, the Sudanese army announced that an SUV had been intercepted while patrolling, six of them (including the Chadian leader) were killed, and two were arrested.
The army claimed that the hostage takers were associated with a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately refuted by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The "quiet majority" of culture
Newspaper news and the ongoing election campaign are currently at the heart of a debate on funding culture.
We should be happy about that.
But one piece of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will speak out to highlight the ridiculous amounts of money that small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical monuments on the verge of starvation?
What politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings forming part of the cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has only invested three and a half million euros to restore Chinon Castle in the Loire valley?
And the constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected in coordination by all citizens, elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Association of Quebec Historical Society (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), 211 companies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archiving and genealogy work to research history, as well as to preserve a large number of private archives and archaeological artifacts, with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations protect our heritage with teeth and nails, and protest with the last power of the drowning when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Part of Fortis bank is nationalised by Benelux governments
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, the first European, due to the spillover effect of the US credit market crisis: the three countries will support the financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch governments agreed on the case at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Officer.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been rolling in waves for more than a year, and decisions on the bank can therefore be considered a precedent in some ways.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states acquire nearly half (49 percent) of the bank's existing property there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from ABN Amro in the Netherlands last year, mainly as insurance companies.
Fortis' shares began to plummet last week, with serious crisis phenomena at the institute in the second half of the week.
Analysts agree, however, that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company's papers only dropped by about 12 percent on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock value has decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but corporate directors say this is not realistic.
The company management also blamed overseas market uncertainties over the adoption of the US $700 billion package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers had already risen slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed to head the bank in the person of Filip Dierckx.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has reported with a substantial offer.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry or lose money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients so far, the accounts have not been stormed.
In Hungary Fortis has an independent branch and acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign insurance contracts with the candidate based on people's drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned in each case.
This must be in independent hands, otherwise we leave the henhouse to the fox," quoted Richard Dick, the developer of the program for tracking prescriptions, in the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in case of damage events dependent on the health condition of the applicant client, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not even make insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: he easily obtains from pharmacies, based on the customer's identification number, what drugs he has purchased in the last year and a half, and the program itself concludes what disease he is suffering from and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol lowering, it suggests that you have virtually unmanageable levels of fat in your blood, which immediately classifies you as a higher risk.
Several versions of the programme are in circulation, some of them also determine a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do besides paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
Disadvantages include that some medicines may be used for multiple purposes, such as some compounds may be used to treat migraines or hot flushes, but they may also be effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers and not the former.
To retrieve and process the data, separate companies have formed, and they ask for the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now bound by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are now processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and it will be increasingly difficult to control the use at the same time.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it covers only healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Congress has a bill that also gives authorities control over businesses specialising in reporting.
Dick Richard admits that this is not enough: he therefore improved his program, which would link the transmission of the data to the explicit consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the person concerned can hardly refuse consent, otherwise the insurers will not sign a contract with him.
Thus, the hens are somewhat dependent on the benevolence of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
Doubles trade between the European Union and India
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit has been dominated by this topic, alongside other, largely global problems.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, where we will be talking mainly about nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater say in international affairs, but that the Member States have not yet been able to reach common ground on whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not called into question at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as EU President-in-Office, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in five years, i.e. increase trade turnover to a hundred billion euros.
Given the fact that trade in goods between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not a very ambitious target.
In this context, in legal terms, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been consolidated, i.e. air traffic may also soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiation.
The aim is to balance out that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth in the EU's partner list.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned on both sides in all its forms and has called for the UN conference to be convened.
They also called for the completion of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large share in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, i.e. to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as that a global deal should be made at the climate conference to come next year and that greenhouse gas production should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to hinder the rise in food prices and support the call for an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where he is preparing to make a deal at the bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that French companies will be commissioned to build nuclear reactors in India with a value of €20 billion.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
For this year's Frankfurt International Book Fair, 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries are expected in 171.790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities: Italy will occupy a 264 square metres exhibition area through the establishment of a unified Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where there will also be an opportunity to present information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian publishing.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market is constantly declining, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found the missing billionaire Steve Fossett's plane a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the area of Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, the Sheriff of Madera County, dispelled all remaining doubts: "After establishing the plane's position, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's about the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff further confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Bureau (NTSB) said that a commission of inquiry was asked a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, which managed to identify the plane and to establish that it really was the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two I.D.s in Fosset's name issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire set up a number of peaks through which he enrolled himself in history.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he also bypassed the ground by plane, without landing.
Many of his records also include flying over the Andes, at an altitude of 15.445 metres, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
It is an unusual but also original and definite form world hobbyist with large surfaces and clear corners.
In a few words, this is the latest "compact SUV" of Mercedes-Benz, with which the German car company tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
Due to this unconventional content, the introduction campaign of SUV GLK available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October will also be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign, which accompanies the introduction of the new vehicle, is using an unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster operation, consisting of three stages, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Como, by November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the spatial presentation of the car, which will include special glasses distributed around the new SUV, Corso Como, in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer will feel as if the car emerges from the poster.
Then, through innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one, so that it can then come together into a single picture.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is using this promotion to introduce something novel into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will this be able to attract the attention of prospective buyers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're young people from Triveneto, probably disqualified from the track.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? Members of the group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years, and which, in truth, has not caused much trouble so far.
They never clashed with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
And from Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller sporadic groups (in fact just a few units) from Campania and Puglia.
Italian flags were waved on which the fans' hometown was marked: on Saturday these were taken off so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleading team called Levski's fans.
The Italian Football Association has made 144 tickets available to Italian fans, which were tickets by name, making it easier to control the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: among those preparing for Sofia, there was no one to be prosecuted, no one to be banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a record related to football were denied tickets and outgoings.
Currently, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for reports from the Sofia Police, and then takes the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots may be subject to five years' ban.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to visits to Italian stadiums but to all European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't set foot in any football field.
Fortunately.
However, we also have to fear that the hooligans will find followers — that is, that of less than one hundred and fifty, others will join.
"We must contain this fire immediately, we must not excuse anyone who behaves like this," said the Ministry of the Interior.
So we'd better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's national match day is coming up in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultra.
The Monitoring Service will meet tomorrow, and the Committee on the Safety of Sports Events will meet on Tuesday, which will also count on a branch of Homeland Security, the secret services dealing with cheerleading behaviour.
"Duce-Duce chanting and swinging arm under the Italian anthem?
He expressed this idea, rather unfortunately, Domenico Mazzilli, who had been appointed to head the Ministry of the Interior's observation service a few weeks ago (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente and previously by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to live the Duce in Bulgaria, but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was still shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, the first man in the surveillance service added, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem, and we need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's also talk a little bit about whistling the Italian anthem: it's not a crime either, but, if I may say so, it's not good manners either..."
