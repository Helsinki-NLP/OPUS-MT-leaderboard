Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear to find themselves on the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, representative of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after it was suggested that the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) should be the Parliament of Wales (Welsh Parliament).
Now representatives from different political backgrounds fear that the new title may make them laugh.
According to one Labour MP, his faction is concerned that their new name will rhyme with the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
For the sake of our non-Walesian readers: in Welsh, twp means simple-minded, and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid party, the whole faction is "unsatisfied" and therefore alternatives are proposed.
One Conservative MP said his faction was "open" to name change, however he noted that the MWP was just a jump from "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh, the letter "w" is pronounced similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire English, or MWP pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law introducing the name change is as follows: "The final decision on the titles for naming members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members."
The 2017 law governing the governance of Wales allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation proposing the inclusion of the name of the Welsh Parliament and which gained broad support.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission prefers the Welsh Parliament Member (Representative of the Welsh Parliament) and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation favoured the MWP alternative.
Members come up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather cumbersome, causing problems for the National Assembly President Elin Jones, who will have to submit the bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly at other points, including the disqualification of Members and committee structures.
Members will be able to take their final vote on the matter of their own title during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonian Republic".
The aim of the referendum is to put an end to a decades-long debate with neighbouring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's name is essentially territorial and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO admission.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on name change and thus does not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply a compromise that they must conclude for their accession to the EU and NATO.
The temples in Harlem in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin's, were also silenced
“In the past, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” says Adams.
– Not any of them today."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“People go out with other people today, ” he says.
– Bars are no longer the community living rooms where people expire daily."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that selling out ecclesiastical wealth will not fulfill the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will return to the same place from which they started.”
And instead of churches, he adds, there will be residential buildings whose residential community also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he claims, “and this will continue to rush the permanent closure of churches, as it is unlikely that most of those who move into these apartments would join the community of faith.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem grew into a city of blacks—the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the thirties,
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known for his boycott leadership against his business owners on Harlem shopping street, 125th Street, which refuses to employ blacks or market blacks' products.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation the bell was built to order the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Parish, proudly referred to the bell play as "the bells of the poor."
According to the expert who played the bell in July, this bell is a "cultural heritage", "an irreplaceable instrument of historical importance."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago joined the greater bellplay of Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't hire anyone to replace it.
In the past few months, there has been a complicated situation involving architects and entrepreneurs, who have been involved in part by the secular leadership of the church and partly by the episcopal office.
The parish's governing body, the parish council, appealed in writing to the episcopal office in July, objecting that the office would "transfer costs" to the council, although the council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain about lack of transparency around the office's house.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California fishing for crabs
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during crab fishing on the opening day of the crab season Saturday in California.
The attack occurred before 7:00 a.m. on the Beacon's Beach coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego said that he was diving with his friends about half an hour ago Saturday morning when he noticed a boy crying out for help.
Hammel at first thought the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a crab, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“ His shoulder was torn at his clavicle, ” Hammel listed what he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water,” he added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, sharks had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, however, it was then found to be not one of the species dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles said more than 135 species of shark occur in the area, but most of these are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand the British beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert sellers and supermarket-style piperestands with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its steadily growing growth in the British beauty market of 2.8 billion pounds in the midst of the decline in fashion and household goods sales, the chain will test larger piperestands in 11 stores across the country, and in case of success, they will appear in newer stores as of next year.
The strengthening of the toiletry line is due to the various ways stores try to replenish the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double, or increase its supply of 3,000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it offers for the first time.
But earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be placed in larger areas on brand-by-brand stands such as Boots and similar stores waiting for customers.
The chain also restarts the Boutique make-up family, in which most of the products are now vegan – they are now being sought by more and more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume distributor also tests its appearance at two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, southern London, while the other opens this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the spread of online purchases and the rerouting of food shopping habits to small local trades, supermarkets must make greater efforts to lure customers in.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to retail stores as the chain of stores tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and products other than food.
Since buying up the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos classes in hundreds of stores as well as some Habitat classes—a move that has also had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The store chain's previous attempt to face up beauty care and pharmaceutical classes failed.
Sainsbury's started a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, however, the controversy that broke out on the distribution of revenue from the pharmaceutical departments in its stores brought this to an end.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business operating in its 281 stores to Celesio operating the Lloyds pharmacy chain for £125 million three years ago.
According to the chain of stores, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As the commercial director of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by transforming the appearance of our piperestands.
We also hired qualified staff to advise those interested.
Our brand offers all needs, and the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide a seductive force that brings the shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones "tombolt" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million deal
Dragons‘ Den's star Peter Jones left "muffled" after television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal for her business selling lifestyle products to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand that markets homewear and accessories.
The business of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand noted by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled the match at Dragons‘ Den's star Peter Jones when she left their promising business selling lifestyle products at the last minute—to focus on her very lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was "tombolt" when television's sweetheart Tuesday, during a tense discussion at the headquarters of Jones's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that he had not had enough time left to devote to their common brand, Truly, due to his new contracts of a total value of £1.5 million.
The business of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from the island country to one of his cottages.
According to one source, “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was supposed to be dealing with this in the long run, and that's what's gonna give him a living for the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, since the departure was so close.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods to be sold."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning host, one of Britain's most profit-making stars, could cost the company millions thanks to considerable amounts of money invested in a range ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible slips.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
For ten years, she and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby launched Truly with Capp back in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples usually vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby becomes the product face of M&S and takes over Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented on what happened last night: "We don't want to comment on [Jones'] business affairs."
Hard words were made, "Then we fell in love"
He joked about what criticisms he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might think was "unpresidential" and why he spoke so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?
Trump asked in a funny "newsreaders" voice.
- I didn't let you do anything."
As he noted, Kim would love to meet for the second time after the first trial held in Singapore in June was hailed as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament by Trump.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, have fallen.
More than three months after the June Singapore Summit, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as your country sees it, there will be no "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament steps.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to maintain sanctions for pressure.
Trump put it in a campaign speech much more optimistic than that.
“ Things are going great with North Korea, ” he said.
- We were supposed to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost.
Now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim saw positive results – completion of rocket tests, release of hostages, and return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“Behaving presiding is not difficult, but now there is not a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in, there are just about 200 people standing in front of me," Trump said pointing to the group ahead.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of deaths of tsunamis and earthquakes subversive to the island.
Indonesia continued to refuse assistance from international aid organizations after the Lombard earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no disaster was announced at national level, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance to arrive.
"In a number of cases, it has been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a little difficult," said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on compiling a relief team that can be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in field rescues.
According to Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Indonesian offices are currently conducting an evaluation of the situation in Palu to see if international aid organisations are required to be involved.
Despite continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country faces the destructive force of nature extremely unprepared.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh Province, this is not common at all in other coasts.
Although there was a tsunami signal in place, the obvious lack of a tsunami siren system in Palu also contributed to the disaster that claimed people's lives.
Even at the best of times, transport between Indonesian islands can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
Although a hospital ship stationed in Lombok is en route to Palu, it is still at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo placed the development of Indonesia's Copotta infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and did not save costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now facing budget deficits before next year's elections.
In addition, the president also faces the ongoing denominational tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to be displaced due to riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs fell upon each other in the streets with bush cutters, bows and arrows, and other heated weapons.
Video: A huge equaliser goal by Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge, London, with his 89th-minute goal, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool, who thus did not lose to Chelsea.
His team had a 0–1 loss when Sturridge received an injection from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's gate.
First he dropped the ball to the left, then started a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high over the sixteenth and headed towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached the net over the weaver Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get into position because there’s always someone, such as Shaq, who plays the ball forward, so I tried to put myself in the position as much as possible, ” said Sturridge in response to LiverpoolFC.com’s question.
– I saw Kante arrive, and I just took it off, and then I didn't think much about it, and I shot him."
Chelsea led 1–0 at halftime after scoring the lead with Belgian star player Eden Hazard's goal in the 25th minute.
With a corner to the battle of the blues, Mateo passed the ball to Kovačič, then managed to break off in the midfield and rush into Liverpool's square.
After a quick injection, Kovačič started and got the ball back on the midfield.
He then started Hazard with a beautiful handover to the sixteen.
Hazard ran the defense and eventually sent the ball to the far corner at Liverpool Gate near Alisson Becker with a left shot.
Liverpool meets Napoli on Wednesday as the next stop of the Champions League group matches at 3:00 p.m. in the Stadio San Paolo arena in Naples.
Chelsea plays against Videoton on Thursday at 3pm in London in the UEFA Europa League.
There are 832 victims already in Indonesia's tsunami
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, announced by the local disaster management agency on Sunday.
As a result of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and the six-metre-high tsunami waves in its wake, several people were buried under the ruins, reported agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, are covered in the ruins of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of a stabbed woman
Police launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body covered with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already in custody on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents in the area to report to anyone who has seen or is dead.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, however, I would like everyone in Birkenhead who was in the vicinity of John Street to see or hear something to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, that anyone who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera should also contact us because they may have information relevant to the investigation."
Police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was a Birkenhead resident and was found within a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are currently notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, however, the police informed him that no one could enter the building for now and that no one could leave him.
When he found out what had happened, he couldn't even speak.
Residents of the building have now been informed that it may be hours before they can gain access to the building again.
One police officer told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
"That's terrible," he repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police minibuses were inside the cordon, and an additional one outside.
Within the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information should send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on the anonymous number 0800 555 111 and refer to the September 30 file 247.
The Parliamentary Cromwell statue is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue might be poetic justice for which Cromwell and his fanatic Puritan followers at the time destroyed England's cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "foolish", an "experiment to rewrite history."
According to Cromwell Society president John Goldsmith: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of Westminster Palace would eventually become the target during the current discussions on the removal of statues.
During the English Civil War, the image destruction was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
Thus, perhaps another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell portrayal reflects the opinion of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure who still has to be celebrated by many today."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is now perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but many consider him to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was the monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this feud that erupted in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the future of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And his achievements as a Lord protector are worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig wounded a Chinese farmer to death
Local press reports that a pig attacked and wounded a farmer to death in a market in southwestern China.
Only a man identified by his surname as Yuan, covered in blood, was found with a ruptured artery next to the pigsty on the market in the town of Liupanshui, Kujzhou Province, reported the incident by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inoculate pigs with a vaccine in a breed on May 30, 2005 in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
The man traveled with his cousin from nearby Junnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's body and discovered that the adjacent pighouse door was open.
He said that the mouth of the giant candy in the pigsty was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation found out that the 250-pound pig did bite the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mauled," said a relative mentioned by Guiyang Evening News only by his last name Wu.
According to security footage, Yuan entered the pigsty at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away so that others could no longer be harmed while police were investigating the clues at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reported to be currently negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although not often, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, on their Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a couple and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
And ten years earlier, a 300 - pound pig in Wales was squeezing a farmer for his tractor until the man’s wife managed to scare him off.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer spoke on CBC News show that although pigs are not usually prone to attack, however, the taste of blood can make them aggressive.
“They are very playful.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect," he said.
Heavy rainfall following Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest region of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is weakening as predicted as it reaches over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will continue to cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
Rosa struck with winds of 140 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane at 5am Eastern Coast Time Sunday morning 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and heads west towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, it floods the southwestern United States with a heavy tropical humidity mass as a tropical storm.
The storm can bring up to 25 cm of rainfall to some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical vapor meeting approaching low pressure masses will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Here, 3 to 10 cm of rainfall can cause sudden flooding, floods filled with debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can also bring 5 to 8 cm of precipitation per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, between 5 and 10 cm of rainfall is expected, especially in Arizona.
Sudden flooding may also occur, with rapidly decreasing strength due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rainfall, it is especially not recommended to start on foot in the desert.
Due to heavy rainfall, canyons can turn into roaring rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden winds and clouds of dust.
The upcoming low-pressure masses can cause heavy rainfall in places on the coast of Southern California.
Precipitation of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause small floods filled with debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers can apply in Arizona as early as Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, and then on Mondays during the day and Tuesdays, rains extend to wider areas.
Severe rainfall spreads to the Four Corner region on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations will occur in the United States as polar air masses cool down, but tropical ones remain fairly warm.
This can also cause drastic temperature differences in places over short distances.
An excellent example is the situation in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is nearly 10 degrees.
In the coming days, it is expected that the summer heat will be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern United States, it is expected that the weather will be warm in the first half of October, and temperatures will be around 25-30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the Northwest.
Temperatures in New York City reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than average.
According to long-term weather forecasts, temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States are likely to exceed average temperatures until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
A total of over 20 million viewers on six television channels followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, who applied for the position of supreme judge, and the woman who accused him of rape in the eighties, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political standoff was not resolved, and broadcasters had to interrupt the regular stream due to Friday's twist at the last minute: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that at a high school party at the time, Kavanaugh groped him and tried to undress him.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate testimony that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
The confessions were probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average viewer count of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other channels that broker the audition, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network numbers, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has difficulty measuring the number of people watching shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, there are so many spectators in the football finals or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the viewer number of Fox News Channel featuring experts in support of Kavanaugh's appointment was the highest of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's audition.
Second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched by 3.1, NBC by 2.94, MSNBC by 2.89, while CNN by 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's account.
The interest did not drop after the hearing.
Friday's drama starred Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued the statement that the senator would vote for Kavanaugh, he was shown on CNN and CBS on Friday morning as a loud crowd of protesters receive him attempting to meet the court affairs committee on elevator.
He stood watched for minutes while being scolded by the crowd, and CNN broadcast the scene live.
“I am standing in front of you, ” said a woman to the senator.
– Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in the public eye of the country?"
Others shouted to him: “You have the power to do what so many women do not.”
All Flake said was that his office issued a statement, and then before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share what he had to say at the committee hearing.
On cable and broadcasting channels, it was then shown live hours later as the committee votes on whether to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only be willing to do so if the FBI investigates charges against the candidate the following week, as advocated by Democrats in the minority.
Flake was convinced of this need by his conversations with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake decided in the wake of conversations with the Coons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision made proper use of his power as it was obvious that without the investigation the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister-Woman Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of playing political games
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of endangering the future of this United Kingdom by their political play and undermining the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview appearing directly next to May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, May's former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EU handle each other's customs is "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims murder: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting involving the death of Louisiana State University (LSU) 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was detained on charges of manslaughter in a violent rage, reported by Baton Rouge's police department.
Police released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and also announced that Sims' glasses fell during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA on it, was said on the WAFB channel belonging to the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police announced that the young man admitted to shooting Sims.
Advocate reports that the court set bail at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report released Friday by the coroner of East Baton Rouge County, the cause of death is a gunshot wound to both the head and neck.
The office thanked the Louisiana State Police for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect by a detachment on fugitive criminals, the state police forensics lab, the university police and residents in the area.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their "committed and persistent work in finding out the truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-metre-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Sims achieved a 5.6 point and 2.6 rebound average per game in the final season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the news of Sims' death "snapped" and "shocked" the team.
"You're always afraid something like this is gonna happen," Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ashes
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After volcanic activity intensified in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash discharges occurred in 24 hours, the national disaster prevention center asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several rumbles and quakes.
In the photos shown on the community portals in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, the windscreens of cars are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysics observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's divisive breakdown referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at riot police, so the streets, often crowded with tourists, were now covered with dense dust paint.
Further fighting broke out later in the day, during which police tried to maintain order with a baton.
The pro-independence groups that sang the slogan "We Will Not Forget, We Won't Forgive You" and the pro-unit protesters behind the slogan "Long live Spain" faced each other for hours.
According to local press reports, fourteen people were supplied with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions remain stable in the region imbued with independence efforts in the wake of a referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The electorate voted with a vast majority in favor of secession, although the turnout rate was rather low as most of the Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when police tried to stop voting in polling stations with actions that resulted in aggressive clashes.
Pro-Independence groups were on the street all night Friday to prevent demonstrations supporting the national police.
Although it could not be prevented, the demonstration did not end up on the normal route.
According to 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in separatist protests with his wife, there is no chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“It was one of the best times of our lives.
I have seen my parents shed tears of joy for which we can vote, but by now our case is down," he said.
Although a substantial, even if a narrow victory was achieved in the regional elections last December, it is difficult for the pro-Cathalan independence parties to maintain momentum this year, after many of their best known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are awaiting arrest for the court's verdict on their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
According to the 42-year-old auto mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded a protest supporting the police with his phone, the conflict was fired on both sides by politicians.
"The situation is getting more tense," he says.
A Catalan leader, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"I can most strongly reject the devastation of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish government by participating in the European elections as a candidate," he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men driving their cars into a house
Police arrested a 33, 34, and 39-year-old man who drove his car to a house several times in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent around 19:30 British summer time.

At a given moment, even a crossbow may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga's goal beat Livingston 1–0 Rangers team
Dolly Menga secured Livingston's victory with his first goal
Fresh into the first class, Livingston gave the Rangers team a big surprise by adding Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been active as coach of the ibroxy club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference as Gary Holt's team went into a deadlock with the Hibernian team in second place.
The Gerrards therefore remained without away victory in the current season of the Scottish League and face the first-place Hearts team next Sunday, to whom they are eight points behind.
Before that, however, the Rangers are still waiting for a match in the European League on Thursday against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased their divisional unbeaten series to six wins, meaning that Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, had not yet lost with the team.
Livingston missed a number of situations with the inaccurate guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the only goal of the game, as they caused the Rangers a lot of problems with their offensive game.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but pulled the attack too far away, and Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's cross-headed ball in front of the goal line.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game as they were sure they could disturb guests in recorded game situations.
The fateful goal was derived precisely from such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in their defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it and scored from the middle of sixteen.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in ball possession, but domestic protection continued to prove unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely in danger.
This trend continued during the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to fend off Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was saved by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with feet, and Lithgow missed a goal from another free kick from Livingston.
The transverse balls were constantly arriving in the 16th of Livingston, but the defenders saved each time. Two penalties were not given to the attacking team: one for Halkett's entry against Glenn Middleton as the replacement player and the other for handing.
"Fenomenal" game by Livingston – match analysis
Report from Tony Macaroni Arena Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston performed phenomenally and reaped the credit.
Players performed well one by one and surpassed expectations.
The team's members and style of play have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but Holt's efforts deserve serious recognition, as the coach has really boosted the team since his arrival.
Several players brought their finest form.
Team Captain Halkett formed a hugely organized defense, and Menga thoroughly sweated Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
The Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they perform well at times under Gerrard's leadership, they were now unable to bring that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they managed to break the domestic defense only once anyway – so the Rangers must get themselves together quickly as they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdoğan found mixed reception in Cologne
It was a pleasant atmosphere and a good mood for the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (29 September) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdoğan's divisive visit to Germany, which aimed to improve the relationship between NATO member countries.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdoğan subsequently traveled to Cologne, for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
Police banned the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 outside the mosque on security grounds, however many supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdoğan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their displeasure with Erdoğan's policy and the German government's decision to receive the head of state.
The two opposing protests illustrate the divisive nature of the President's policy, which some Turkish-born German citizens celebrate as heroes, while others see the autocrat in it.
Road accident in Deptford: hit by a bicycle car and lost his life
A cyclist was killed when he collided with a car in London.
The crash occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high traffic road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city, at approximately 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but he was killed at the scene.
The crash occurred just a few months after another bicycle hit-and-run became a fatal victim on Childers Street, just a mile from the Saturday crash site.
According to a statement from the London Police Department, police continue to work on establishing the man's identity so that they can notify relatives.
Due to the investigation, roadblocks and bus diversions make traffic more difficult, and authorities advise that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six prison guards injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during riots in a heavily guarded man's prison, reported by the prison board.
The riots began at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire, and have not yet been able to contain them.
In order to deal with the situation, the special forces called "Tornado" were deployed to the scene. Eight inmates were involved in the riots, who were confined to a building wing.
Members of the special forces suffered only minor head injuries that were managed to supply at the site.
Statement by a spokesman for the prison organization: “A specially trained prison guard team handles the situation in Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police, and they will expect further prison sentences."
In Long Lartin men's penitentiary, more than 500 prisoners are being held, among whom are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the warden of the prison was reported to have had to be given hospital treatment after being attacked by one of the inmates.
And last October, the Special Forces also needed help to bring down a serious riot in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation in drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depressions, but this is exactly what the state is expected to expect at the beginning of next week when the remainder of the hurricane named Rosa sweeps through the desert southwest region, drastically increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already ordered flood preparedness from Western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah by Monday and Tuesday; the alert also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is projected to travel straight through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive Monday night and bring heavy rains with it.
The Phoenix weather service posted the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within the 200-mile radius of Phonenix in the form of tropical storms or depressions!
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967), for example, approached the border of AZ 40 miles away."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50-100 mm rainfall, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases such as Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (central areas of the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.), between 25 and 50 mm of rainfall can be expected, but in some places 100 mm may fall.
Rain brought by Rosa can bring relief for areas not threatened with lightning floods, as the area is currently plagued by severe drought.
Despite floods being a serious threat, some of the rainfall can have a beneficial effect on the southwestern regions with drought.
"According to the U.S. drought monitoring service, over 40% of Arizona's territory is hit by a minimum extreme drought, which is considered the second most dangerous category," says weather.com report.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the peninsula of Lower California, Mexico.
It will continue to be hurricane-powered, and on Sunday morning, bringing winds of up to 137 km/h, it will pass some 600 km south of the Punta Eugenia land language in Mexico and will travel north at approximately 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder currents in the Pacific and will lose its strength.
Thus, Mexico's coast is expected to reach again as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or in the evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected to significantly increase the chance of floods.
"The rainfall may result in an average rainfall of 70–150 mm from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where there may be 250 mm rainfall in places," says weather.com report.
Rosa then continues through Mexico northwards as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday, in the early morning hours, by then in the form of a tropical depression to reach southern Utah areas by Tuesday night, swept across Arizona.
"The greatest threat posed by Rosa and her remains will be the extreme rainfall expected in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and in the southwestern desert areas of the U.S.," said the National Hurricane Center.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning floods and draughts in desert areas, and landslides in mountainous areas are to be feared.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four persons arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old youth was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 04:00 a.m. local time, an injured teenage boy was found in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace neighborhood.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, and his condition is “stable”.
According to a police statement, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset during the night.
Authorities ask the public that if anyone has a mobile phone recording of what has happened, contact them.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh had to suffer the Democratic Party's "worst and anger"
"Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh votes against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in the city of Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during Kavanaugh's candidacy, the Democratic Party "had to suffer his ill will and anger".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he firmly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that the man had committed sexual violence against her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also testified and stood up for his earlier claims.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans could see for themselves" that day Kavanaugh's "brilliant and fearless character."
"Votes cast alongside Judge Kavanaugh are votes cast alongside one of the finest legal professionals of our time who has an immaculate public service record," Trump stated to his West Virginia supporters.
The president was implied to refer to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the by-elections.
“We are separated from one of the most important choices of our lives in just five weeks.
I'm not running personally, but basically I'm running, he said.
– That's why I go everywhere to support the best candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats follow the tactics of "resistance and obstruction".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a leading Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds died in a tsunami caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, with the number of dead rising
Many were swept away by the tide, and at least 384 people were killed when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, said local authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival held in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves nearly six metres (18 ft) tall reached the beach at dusk, swept many away, and destroyed everything that came their way.
The tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning came up yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach longer, did not flee immediately, so they became victims of the waves," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster response agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta press conference.
"The tsunami didn't just come by itself, carrying cars, loglets, houses and everything else off the coast with it," Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h on the high seas before reaching the coast.
Some of them climbed up to the top of the trees from the flood and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Air footage published by the agency of the disaster shows a number of destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks shook the coastal town.
Earthquakes could be detected in an area of some 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that during the Friday earthquake, approximately 200 times more energy was released than from the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that resulting geographical conditions could have enhanced the effect of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage was "significant", thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
Several of the victims' bodies were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and then added that the number of injured so far is 540, and they are looking for another 29 persons.
According to Nugroho's statement, on the coast 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, the area called Donggala, the number of injured and damage caused may be even greater as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is “completely paralyzed, no information is available” about Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," states the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that experts and volunteers from the organisation are on their way to the disaster area.
"The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse," they added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday that it had not informed the population about the tsunami that hit Palu, however, according to management, the waves had already reached shore while the alert was being issued.
One amateur footage shared on social networking sites shows a man trying to warn people on the street of the approaching tsunami with desperate cries from the upper floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a huge wall of water will hit the coast, drifting cars and buildings with it.
Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, making communication in the Palu area impossible, making it harder for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army sent relief supplies of cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but authorities say that the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city was opened only to facilitate relief work, and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under tent tarpaulins set up in the office's courtyard, however they encountered traces of terrible destruction on their journey, Doseba said.
“ They said they saw a lot of ruined houses, ” he added.
- It's really bad."
While relief teams began preparing disaster relief work, some complained that foreign professionals with high experience in this area were unable to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief shipments and personnel from overseas can only be allowed into the territory of the country if the crash site is declared a disaster area at national level.
That hasn't happened so far.
“The incident continues to be treated as a provincial disaster, said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
– As soon as the government acknowledges that it is indeed a disaster at national level, we can let international emergency services in, but no announcement has been made yet."
On the second night after Friday's upheaval and tsunami, Palun's friends and family members continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape smuggled some light into the dark atmosphere of coverage of natural disasters.
On Saturday, during rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, workers managed to free a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, prepared two contestants from the missing paragliding team for the Asian Games completed early in the month, this time held in Indonesia.
Besides the missing, his students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
"As a Veteran paraglider, what happened places a great burden on me," he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the paragliders, he desperately sought to reach the contestants on WhatsApp who were attending the beach festival Palun for hours.
However, in addition to the messages, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue ticks.
"I think that means that messages could no longer be delivered," he said.
$26,750 stolen while uploading an ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping mall
On Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a fellow Brink‘s who was charging an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall, in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The cash truck driver was emptying an ATM at the entertainment center and was preparing to fill it with additional bills, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the announcement.
A man “approached his Brink‘s employee from behind” while busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses have seen several suspected perpetrators flee the scene, but the police statement does not contain the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper's name changed to Yere
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: "The creature formerly called Kanye West."
41-year-old West had been nicknamed Ye for some time and was also the title of his eighth album released in June.
He announced the change of name before his Saturday Night Live performance, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, she takes Ariana Grande's place, who cancelled the appearance on grounds of "emotional reasons", said the show's producer.
The new name is not only an abbreviation of the rapper's current stage name – according to his earlier revelations, it is also of religious significance to West.
“I understand that “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible and means “you” in the Bible,” West mentioned earlier when talking to radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
- So I'm you and I'm us and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one, and that's what became Ye, which represents the good within us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album rather reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of the famous rappers who prefers to change their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has also run as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he announced that he would now prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former fellow creator, JAY-Z, also varied several times by whether his name should be written together, with a dash, or even in capital letters.
Mexican president vowed not to use the army against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, in connection with the upcoming 50th anniversary of student protests in the bloodbath, promised never to use the force against civilians.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelco Square that he would "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, military troops in the square opened fire on participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the deaths of about 300 people when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help Mexican youths – giving students monthly financial benefits and plans to establish additional free state universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The US should double the funding framework for AI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for such research, stated Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and employee of solutions using artificial intelligence, who had previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the United States government made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the US not having an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China also announced its related plans: the country's goal is to become the world's number one AI developer by 2030.
"Doubting the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in the AI area is imminent," Lee said.
By doubling research grants, the chances of the United States taking the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence could also double, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that managed to defeat the top American Othello player, and later served as a board member for Microsoft Research and as chairman of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next such event would be held, because it would be possible to find new future shapers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain the state support they need for their research, Lee said.
"China is not stealing scientific leaders, but large corporations," he added.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted several large university skulls over the past few years to work in the field of MI.
According to Lee, changing immigration policy could also greatly help the U.S.'s aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that people who have a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically receive a green card," he said.
The State Council of China announced its plan to develop next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's national science fund provides support to academic institutions staff in a similar way as the U.S. National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, however the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI centre, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
NSF currently spends $100 million a year in support of AI research.
Meanwhile, the United States Legislature, which had planned to establish a National Security AI Committee, has not taken further action on the matter for months.
A referendum on changing the name of the country is held in Macedonia
Macedonia's population voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic". This step would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece that prevented the country from accepting its application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, one of its provinces called Macedonia, argued that its northern neighbour's name indicates that it has claimed a Greek area of the same name and has thus far vetoed the country's membership of NATO and the EU.
The two governments made a deal in June on the state's new name, however, according to national sentiment opponents, the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful if the 50% turnout for the valid referendum would be available.
The question on the ballots reads as follows: "Do you support the country's membership of NATO and the EU and do you accept the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the name change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev at the forefront, argue that this price is worth paying in order to give Macedonia, as one of the countries ascended in the ruins of Yugoslavia, a chance to join the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country so that young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum alone is not legally binding, enough parliamentary members have stated that they feel obliged to vote.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
According to the state election committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on voting day.
However, the turnout to this point reached only 16%. This figure was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ultimately involved 66% of registered voters).
"I have come to vote for my children, because we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62), who cast his vote in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko, voted in favour of name change in Sztrumica, in the referendum of 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage as well as chairs and tents for the referendum for boycotts.
“We also support the country’s membership of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with pride, with our heads up, and not through the maid door,” said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If we are not to be accepted as Macedonia, then we can also turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be expected to deal with investments in Macedonia that the country with unemployment above 20% is desperately in need.
"I think that the majority will support our cause, as more than 80% of the country's population basically supports EU and NATO membership," Zaev said after he cast his vote.
He also added that the "yes" vote means "insuring the future of the country".
According to the results of a survey published by the political research institute of Macedonia last Monday, 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout rate.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV shows a 57% turnout on Sunday.
70% of those who want to vote said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout should be at least one vote higher than 50%.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government to take power in May of last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, scores goal by evading full Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling thoroughly managed to defend Brighton, making Manchester City a 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, England.
Aguero scored his 65th-minute goal as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker caught a pass in midfield as the first step of the attack, and
Escaped between the three Brighton defenders, he made it out into the open.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He eluded a defender and then ran down more when he got near the sixteen in Brighton.
He then passed left to Sterling, who appeared there.
The English striker had already returned the ball with coercive force to Aguero, who finished the action with his right foot, hitting the right side of the gate of the Brighton netkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” told reporters Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager.
– We agreed to play 55 minutes, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, that's when he scored."
The initial advantage was gained by Sterling's action by the blues in the English championship clash.
The goal was born in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, on the side of the Brightoners, got a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball for Leroy Sane on the left edge.
Sane played the ball for a while before launching Sterling to the long.
For the Battle of the Blues, he could barely flick the ball into the gate before slipping outside the baseline.
The City will play next Tuesday, from 12:55 in Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany with the Hoffenheim team in the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies.
As the Nationals team missed the opportunity to enter the postseason, they had no reason to really struggle.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, is eager to enter the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opponent team still has a chance in the playoffs. The Rockies have a one-game advantage ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
The Rockies secured at least one consolation branch place for themselves with their 5–2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, however, their first division title is still to be won.
“Whether we don’t have a chance anymore, we can stand up to them with the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver expected to peak now compared to the whole year.
Of course I'm in the mood to get into orbit."
The Nationals team still has to pick the starting player for Sunday, but it is reported that Scherzer will be the pitcher in this situation.
For Scherzer, who had pitching practice on Thursday, this will be his 34th starting pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed Washington player this season stands with 18–7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 games.
Trump's campaigning in West Virginia
The president also surreptitiously referred to the situation around Supreme Judicial candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in by-elections.
"Everything we have done so far is at stake in November.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the greats, the greats – I don't personally run, but I'm essentially running, which is why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: “Everyone can see what these terrible radical democrat groups are doing, they can see for themselves.
They are truly determined, and they can use any means to regain power, visible malice and meanness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample to control, who they want to control, who they want to control, but we don't let ourselves be."
According to the president, Democrats are using "resistance and obstruction".
"They could see all this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged and malicious and mean and lying."
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, which, hearing of which, displayed a loud displeasure of the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – all with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who freely say what they think
I was not surprised at all when Momentum activists in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we are thinking.
My fellow Member of Parliament Joan Ryan received similar treatment for persistent opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship didn't like the fact that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the very issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
On the invitation of the Labour Party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, it said that they wanted a "received and productive meeting".
For most of my eight years as the Labour Party's local representative, these Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today, however, the tone has changed, and the promise of a more "restrained, polite" policy has been forgotten, if ever realized.
It is increasingly striking that disparate views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have been expecting me to turn my back on my individual opinion more and more recently and take sides for things I would never otherwise agree with, whether on national security matters or on the single European market.
After all my public speeches, regardless of what I actually said, they start derogating me on social networking sites, demanding my replacement, criticising the policy that is pulling me into the middle, and telling me that I should not even be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than many of my colleagues, as the contributions to me tend to be limited to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, yet do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that attacks of this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the Labour Party's need to support a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we have renounced diversity, and with every "untrustful" motion and every amendment to the election rules, the party's circle of tolerance is narrowing.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to hold back, not be so outspoken, and then "everything will be fine."
However, that is not why I entered politics.
32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had neglected schools so much that our classroom was almost crumbling, and then I fought for better public care for the most deprived both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done otherwise in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was completely clear to everyone what political positions I represented, and on which topics I disagreed with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why so much time and effort must be devoted to questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my most important message is not to members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of replacement or political purpose will not discourage me from acting in my own opinion and taking into account everyone's interests.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr breaks undefeated to the top
Two late attempts somewhat modified the outcome, but there is no doubt about the Ayr's deserved victory in the most entertaining game of the day, Tennent‘s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, as the only undefeated of the ten teams.
Thanks to their unparalleled defense and superior use of the situation, they prevailed, so the domestics and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
"We have had to meet a number of challenges during our previous games, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, a Melrose player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr has made much better use of its situations than we have."
With Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt to make Frazier Climo score, Ayr took the lead. Thanks to the yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes loaned by Warriors, Melrose could have broken the distinction, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not make it a point.
Climo sweated the defense of the Ayr with a penalty, scoring just at halftime and then from a one-man experiment, resulting in the first half with a 17–5 result in favor of the Ayr.
Melrose started the second half strongly, selling Patrick Anderson's try Baggot, reducing the team's downside to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be taken off the field, and in the sequel, Ayr further increased its advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempt, whose laurels were reaped with Climo's assistance.
Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, also received a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's attempt at human superiority, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began catching up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for decommissioning Slimo without a ball, MacPherson presented a touchdown from the penalty line behind Ayr's storming team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent forward divorcer Gregor Henry to his fifth try at home.
The main character of Still Game began a new career in the catering industry
It seems that one of the Still Game stars, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it has been revealed that he has been headed by a company that manages restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes together and in which he plays along with his old fellow comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the coming ninth will be the final season, and Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source from the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from Glasgow's "blooming catering industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a beach hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol around the naval command decorated with sailboats in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags on the public buildings.
Maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon proclaim the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
There are still vivid memories of the lost coast in unsealed Bolivia, taken by Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict for resources, and there is a strong desire to rewind the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been most powerful for many decades, since Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the 1st of October, ending five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the ball, which floods people with a spirit of belonging and peace, who are looking forward to the outcome in a positive mood," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivians monitor the International Court of Justice's decision on projectors, hoping that the Hague tribunal will stand for Bolivia, and Chile will be obliged to sit at a negotiating table after decades of rapsodic attitudes so that Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic, native-born president—who is facing a controversial fight to continue for next year's re-election—has much to lose with Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he stated at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in Bolivia's favor, and that it would not change much if its decision were to benefit Bolivia.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to judge Chilean territories, and has also stipulated in advance that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice judgment was reached less than six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have not only helped Bolivia's cause, but have even repulsed it.
“The issue of the maritime exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” said Zárate.
– Due to Morales' hostile rhetoric, the remaining benevolence of the Chileans was also gone."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not delegated an ambassador to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the finding that judicial decision-making would have been unusually fast.
Monday brings Bolivia an "exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile" and a chance to "get out of the closure of 139 years of strife both well," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents—used the maritime debate to turn it into a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific,” he added.
– Judgment gives us an opportunity to see that it is time to move on from the past."
North Korea: no nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Secretary of State Ri Jongho says his country won't be the first to disarm his nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
He made the comment when it appeared that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had managed to resume the stalled nuclear talks, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jongun.
According to Ri, it is "desirable" to believe that the continued sanctions and the American obstruction of the declaration ending the Korean War will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jongun and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism surrounding Pyongyang's commitment to disarming the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only key to its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows showed the huge caps that will soon appear in top-class shops
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their 2019 spring/summer collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of the Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats made a sensation on Instagram during the summer, and the above fashion designers also put their attention-raising works on a runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feather-like, wide flange and almost swallowed up the models' heads.
Among the other oversized accessories appeared gem-decorated watermelons, a sorcerer hat, and even a pineapple that was not really designed to keep one's head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks just before Halloween.
Several of the coloured masks had their mouths sewn together and reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of these pieces resembled a diving mask, supplemented with pipe and glasses, and another painted like a melting funnel ice cream.
If you like these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
Style analysts predict that giant caps may already be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path trampled by “La Bomb”, a straw hat of 60 cm wide that we could see on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the less practical hat that conquered social media sites presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost the size of the swimsuit model that held it.
The dark orange raffia bag – decorated with rafia tassels and topped with a white leather clamp – was one of the outstanding pieces of Jacquemus' 2019 spring/summer La Riviera collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect huge hats and beach bags to appear in top-class clothing stores next summer. The designer has created such an elemental effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scottish independent schools have traditionally provided excellent education. Looking at recent outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed until 2018, which is further strengthened by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and the position they hold as world citizens.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and introduce customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
But if you speak his language, it will reach his heart."
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we are to build relationships and trust with those from other countries.
This year's exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have produced the best results from foreign languages.
68 percent of all students studying foreign language achieved a higher A degree (above 85 percent).
Based on the data collected from SCIS 74's member school, it can be shown that 72 percent of students received higher A degrees in Mandarin, while 72 students in German, 69 in French and 63 percent in Spanish achieved A degrees.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as essential knowledge, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today languages, as chosen objects, have become as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Committee on Employment and Vocational Training showed that 17 percent of employers say that filling empty positions is difficult due to a lack of language skills.
This also shows that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As knowledge of foreign languages is expected in more and more jobs, language skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career one chooses, if he has learned a foreign language, he will gain a lifetime of enduring knowledge from which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to a multilingual candidate.
According to a survey by YouGov, in which 4,000 adults were interviewed in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were not well enough in any foreign language to be able to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15 percent) of respondents.
That is why it is important to focus on the language teaching of children at this time.
To speak more languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children that, armed as adults, has a better chance of applying for more important jobs.
In Scotland, different languages will be dealt with in each school.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of paramount importance to the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the interests of the child, he will learn several optional languages from independent schools and will be trained by instructors who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future may save.
It is not difficult to see that, in the current global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools offer the possibility of choice, diverse and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron introduces himself with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It won't take long for fans to sit on pins to see LeBron James enter the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced James would play in the opening game of the preseason Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's gonna spend on the field, that's a question.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton wrote on the Lakers official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited period of time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans with the Lakers were during the six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to play in the preseason to be ready," he replied.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump begins a long series of campaign events in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This will be the first of Trump's five announced events next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi supporting him.
Now that a vote confirming his intended candidate to fill the vacant seat of the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump seeks to gather supporters for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are in danger of losing power over Congress when votes run in November.
When does Trump's event in West Virginia start tonight, and where can he be followed online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia will begin tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 7:00 Eastern Time.
Trump can also follow his West Virginia rally online via YouTube's live broadcast.
Trump will probably also be affected by this week's hearing of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which proved particularly tense in light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate confirmation vote was suspended for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of the suddenly growing events is to help the Republicans' situation before the November elections.
According to Trump's campaign advisor, next week's five events will serve to "activate voters and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority that they currently own in the Senate and House of Representatives", Reuters writes.
“To have control of Congress in his hands is so critical of his political plans that the president visits as many states as possible. We are looking at a busy campaign period," reported a campaign spokesman asking Reuters for his name to be silenced.
The event planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight "may bring supporters from the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and may even be included in media coverage in Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump seeks to help his Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is not in a favourable position according to surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intercede personally to better perform in surveys," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team struggles with full shoulder width ahead of Sunday individuales to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the four matches on Saturday afternoon were much needed by the Ryder Cup.
Luck and the moment swinging back and forth is a rather air-borne sports concept, yet all players believe in it, most notably during tournaments such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead and only four more advantage, so we can say that we have the ball right now," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe is still leading by four points, and twelve more can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells it, feel that they have finally received a small back wind and can draw encouragement from several things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas' form, who have played together all day and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved infallible from starting punch to hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His bay victory cries grew louder as he progressed with the round, hitting with a critical roll and equalizing in the fourth game, so that he and Thomas were in a double handicap after two.
His final roll of the game at hole 15 resulted in a similar cry of joy, a kind that can make the viewer believe that everything is not yet lost for the American team.
"You just have to dig deep inside yourself and mind your own game," Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for a chance to leave a trail of your own.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair of the Ryder Cup, have been able to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange but adorable pair brought four out of four, and they seem unable to make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not perform over par on Saturday afternoon, and performed similarly on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics between them and their loudly supportive audiences, they have become the standard by Sunday, and no one is more expected to see the Sun secure Europe's victory on Le Golf National's course with a receipt than from Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win at the same time, with different holes.
However, it is still too early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio García, the morning four hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once one and twice two strokes above par were completed by the first nine holes by the Spanish and Swedish, which pushed them into a ups and downs from which they had no chance to get out.
On Sunday, there won't be anyone to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-ball matches are extremely fun at close range thanks to the pair's interactions. You can see who gives you advice, which you don't give, and how the strategy can change in a flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far and starts with a significant advantage for the last day, but this section four has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, despite being missed by many, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the final day of the Ryder Cup with a welcome advantage after finishing Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a score of 10–6 against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's double led the hair, winning two victories against the Sick Bay Tiger Woods, thus raising the difference to four points on Le Golf National's track.
Thomas Bjørn's European team – who is trying to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago – dominated against the constantly failing American team during the morning four-ball matches, winning the series 3-1.
America had more resistance during the fours, bringing in two games, but they still couldn't break the gap.
Jim Furyk's team should score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a series, while he and Molinari—who are referred to only as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend—are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in his four opening games.
After beating the Woods–Patrick Reed pair in the four-baller, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau's double to a definite 5&4 with their great team play.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes even sparked his talent, but already lost 19 of his 29 games out of four-ballers and fours, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning four-ballers, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and defeated the pair in the fours 2&1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the world rankings first and third.
However, Europe has not succeeded in all this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time defending champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do this with two points on Saturday.
They won a tormented 2&1 victory against the pair of Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ballers and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only two times a team managed to come back from the four-point down in individual competitions, although Furyk's defending team has enough to hold the trophy.
However, after only being the second best for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems rather unrealistic.
"No way" for North Korea to unilaterally lower you if you don't trust your negotiating partner
North Korea's Secretary of State told the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased mistrust of the United States of America, and there is no way that under such circumstances the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear armament.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "significant and generous steps" over the course of last year, such as shutting down nuclear and missile experiments, shutting down the site of nuclear experiments, and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, however, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
– In the absence of confidence in America, we feel that our nation's safety is not guaranteed, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be unilaterally and first discharged."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment at Washington's resistance to the idea of "staged" nuclear disarmament, which, by scenario, would receive North Korea's rewards for the steps taken up to that point, his statement did seem significant because he did not clearly refuse unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jongun and Donald Trump at the very first summit ever between a powerful U.S. president and North Korean leader that took place in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim promised to work on "nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's integrity.
North Korea seeks to make an official point by the end of the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States of America considers that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington did not give in to strict international sanctions that hit North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and increase the pressure by sanctions to force its will on us, and it also protests against the declaration of the end of the war, ” said Ri.
– The idea that we can be brought to our knees with sanctions is a wishful thinking of people who don't know us.
The problem is that unrelieving sanctions only increase our suspicions."
Ri did not mention that a second summit was planned between Kim and Trump, which, however, was specifically discussed by the U.S. President in the United Nations early this week.
Rather, the Minister pointed out that three meetings have taken place between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jein in the last five months, and added: "If the country involved in nuclear disarmament were South Korea rather than the United States of America, nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate."
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's when she told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the "evil president", called Kim a "missile man" who was on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, lauded Kim with praises that he had the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but also noted that there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain until North Korea implemented nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no time limit was imposed, meaning "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the steps taken so far.
On the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: "Security Council sanctions must be kept steadfast until we have achieved actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Rí during the U.N. General Assembly break, and then said that he was going back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of making "gengster-like demands".
As part of a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to disarm a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States took "the right steps."
According to Mun, the "suitable steps" referred to by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, or steps that could lead to normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to rest enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year encouraged students to sleep more, also fighting against the increasingly gaining macho culture of caffeine-heated all-night learning.
An academic concluded that students from the world's number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he believes is the first such training in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard College of Medicine and practises as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He was encouraged to develop the course by giving a lecture earlier on the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why am I only facing this now as a senior?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
During the course launched for the first time this year, students are told how the right sleep patterns have a fundamental impact on their educational and sports performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their general well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard College of Medicine and director of the university's health service, the university decided to start the course because during the week students were found to be extremely unsleepy.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a dormitory room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is influenced by sleeplessness, and why bedtime routines have significance.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area with interactive icons is presented to encourage participants to consider the daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change student behavior.
But we believe that they have a right to these knowledge – just as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which learning through a night is a achievement continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students results in increasing problems of sleep deprivation.
Sufficient and quality sleep is a student's “secret weapon” in the struggle with stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even protects from obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into a starving mode and causes a continuous sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and took one of the professor's courses as a freshman at Harvard last year.
He said that what he heard there had opened his eyes and encouraged him to fight for the launch of a university-level training course.
He hoped that as a next step, postgraduate students would be able to participate in a similar training program before settling into the competitive sphere.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning for bedtime, an alarm to wake up, and familiarize themselves with the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily dissuade them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another away defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's team apart into a 1–0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox tried to win their first away victory after the 4-1 win in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat to Gary Holt's team so far from his 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship)'s eloping first place finish, Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers' unmotivated team did not even get close to equalizing.
While the Rangers thus slipped down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third, merely missing the Hibernian due to the goal difference.
The Rangers may also face further difficulties after the beach marker Calum Spence had a head injury requiring medical attention due to an object likely thrown off the guest stands.
Gerrard also changed eight points on the team that reached the semifinals of the Betfred Cup by sweeping Ayr.
Holt, however, played with the same 11 men from Livingston who took one point from Hearts last week, and would certainly have been happy to watch his perfected team choke his opponent's game wherever he had it.
Although the Rangers led in ball possession, Livingston took it more with what it had gained.
They could have scored as early as the first two minutes when Menga started Scott Pittman's first shot towards Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder failed to sell the ziccer.
A low free kick by Keaghan Jacobs landed at team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty at the fifteenth minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were able to show only two shots at the first half gates, but the weak shot by Lula Coulibaly's headman and Ovie Ejaria to the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute went against the round of the match, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers again missed a ziccer imposed by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball in for Scott Robinson, who found Menga well for the easy ending.
Gerrard decided in the break, replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately exerted its influence on the game when he teased the extreme Morelos, but Kelly, who brought an impressive form, blocked in time.
Livingston continued to make it possible to play exactly the game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls in a row.
Holt's team could have taken a greater advantage in the final minutes, but McGregor took the net well and struck Jacobs' position before Lithgow had a missed from a corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came in as a substitute for the Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson was still not convinced.

An excerpt from our "Sunday Breakfast" almanach: September 30, 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... is the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that could have produced a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been one of the basic tools of science ever since, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" featuring strange cowboy scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, it also became part of pop culture:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. It makes you look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on this headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted due to the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen to me, he's kind of bouncing right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he lives on in his invention bearing his name.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a lab.
This enables them to “see” the protein that accompanies a variety of cancers. Treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has yielded promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system how to detect abnormal cells could say goodbye to ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
It is part of the method of extracting immune cells from the patient; it is modified in the laboratory to ‘see’ a protein called HER2 that is a common accompaniment to several cancers; then to replant the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the American National Cancer Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of multiple types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, based on highlighting immune cells and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells, has previously been used successfully to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West's SNL appearance wearing a MAGA cap culminated in a abusive tirad supporting Trump.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live's studio after an incoherent manifestation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and then announced that he would apply for president in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in Make America's Great Again cap, he began speaking against the Democrats and re-emphasizing his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to someone who is white, he asks: ‘How can you like Trump because he is racist?’
If I were interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment charges by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the video of West's oration was uploaded to social networking sites by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the upload.
West even complained to the audience that he was being picked on behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don't go out in that hat.'
I was intimidated!
And they said I was in the sunken place," the Washington Examiner said.
West continued: “Do you want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman robe because that means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His manifestations were accompanied by whistles from the audience at least twice, and SNL characters apparently felt embarrassed by one of the eyewitnesses saying to Variety: "The whole studio was shrouded in silent silence."
West was invited at the last minute instead of singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend rapper Mac Miller died a few days before.
West raised questions in several ways when he performed his song I Love it dressed as Perrier glass.
West was assured of his support by Conservative TPUSA group leader Candace Turner in a tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THE MOUTH."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply "self, and that's great."
“But I have decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of his music or fashion articles or with the support of his “art”), whom I believe to own and distribute an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is "the creature formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and thus follow in Diddy's footsteps, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His rapper partner Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince also changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
They're charging the Belfast restaurant stabbing with attempted manslaughter.
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted manslaughter after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to a statement from the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow of Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violently set fantasy series of Middle Ages, he himself often grabs a sword.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against stereotypical macho heroes, pointing out that, seeing such heroes, little boys often feel that hard action is required to fight out respect.
Kit said in his statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he thought "something went wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the harmful effect of exaggerated masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married her also 31-year-old series colleague Rose Leslie said that she thought it would be very important to remedy the problem.
“I personally am deeply concerned with this case—how is the depiction of masculinity so distorted?” the actor asked.
– What did we teach men when they were children about the problem we are facing now?"
Kit says that television is also responsible for spreading the distorted image of masculinity, since the shows often feature very masculine characters.
Continuing the line of thought, he added: “What was born with us, and what is it that we are learning?
What does the street and TV say to young boys that makes them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big issues of our time – and how we can change that.
Because it is clear that there is something wrong with young men."
Kit stated in the interview that after the series' summer season finale he would not be included in Game of Thrones history series or sequels because he "has had enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the lead role in recycling Sam Shepard's True West film, which is about a producer and his brother in a robbery lifestyle.
The actor said that the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife Rose, whom he met while making the show.
"I met my wife on set, so I owe my future family and my life ahead of me to the show," Kit said.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China’s number of new patients increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
Health officials have said that this means more than 820,000 people involved.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by approximately 40,000.
A change from previous ones is that a significant majority of newly infected people are sexually exposed to the disease.
The disease used to spread rapidly through the transfusion of infected blood in parts of China.
Health officials, however, stated at a conference in the province of Junnan that the number of such cases had since fallen to nearly zero.
Nevertheless, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The sexual transfer of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
Based on estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men end up marrying women due to the country's conservative values.
In many cases the disease spreads in these relationships due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of a programme to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her crew members leaked Republican senators' data and condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters dismissed on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal data of three Republican senators on the Senators' Wikipedia site.
According to the Democratic Representative of Los Angeles, the allegations in question were distributed by "extreme right-wing" experts and websites.
"Lie, lie, and more vile lies," Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information released reportedly contained the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday. The publisher's identity is unknown, but it is certain that they were released from the Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh regarding sexual harassment.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, say the IP address identified as the source is linked to Waters' office, and they also reported data about a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars, ” Waters continued.
– My staff member has no responsibility for leaking information. However, his right to anonymity, protection of his personal data and security has been violated as a result of the fraud and lying accusations.
These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars."
Waters' statements on the Internet were quickly criticized. Critics included Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
“It’s an angry denial, ” wrote Fleischer.
– On this basis, Waters does not seem to have the temperament required for his position as a representative.
If someone's being accused of something he didn't commit, he can't react angryly.
You can't be defiant.
You cannot question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and calm."
Waters' reaction was apparently compared to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic Party criticisms, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is applying for Waters's seat as a Republican candidate in the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's serious," he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in his notice that his office had notified "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement" of the false charges.
"We are concerned that the perpetrators will be known," Waters continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for all acts that endanger or harm any member of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's lame spy comedy
Today, it has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there can be no exception to the action comedy/parody franchise running under the name Johnny English, the first part of which, Johnny English was reloaded in 2003, and the second part of Johnny English was reloaded into cinemas in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation become the sarcastic satires parodying ourselves, in which we indulge in our own obvious lameness?
What is certain is that the eye-wielding, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition for another return – it is already clear from his name that this comic character was created so that crowds of viewers in cinemas of non-English-speaking countries around the world could laugh at it.
Johnny English, of course, is a dorky secret agent who imagines himself to be endearing with his bizarre manners, thus reminiscent of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes of Mr. Bean, and occasionally of the guy who contributed to the performance of the Firewheels theme song by pressing a single key at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial who left chaos everywhere.
There are some good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in medieval armor approached a helicopter, and when he got there, the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comical vein prevails well in the film, but the film's humor doesn't really work, and even seems unnecessary, since nowadays, franchises with a "serious" tone such as James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series also bravely touch the instrument of humor.
It feels like the film's humor is more aimed at children, and for me Johnny English's wacky, failed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The film's starting point is eternal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the British spy network's super-secret online network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the greatest terror of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This may be the last nail in the coffin of the conceited and divisive Prime Minister, whose political popularity is in ruins anyway: Emma Thompson practically plays Theresa May and brings everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors outline to him that since all active agents have been revealed, he must put a retired agent on the job.
This retired agent is, of course, the clumsy Johnny English, who has worked as a teacher at a distinguished school since his retirement, but, unlike the curriculum, teaches children to spy – there are funny scenes here, of course, while English presents the basics of spying in a kind of "Rocksuli".
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he is reunited at the emergency briefing with his former, much-suffered gun carrier Bough, who is now played by Ben Miller.
Bough has since married, in addition, married the captain of a submarine whose mouth is always ear-deep—the captain is played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for much better roles than this.
Thus, the bumbling “Batman and Robin” pair of His Majesty’s national security service is back in action and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a woman of true destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly entrenched by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta and is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, then sneak themselves into Volta's luxury yacht in the midst of an amazing commotion, and English actually unleashes hell when he tries to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-headset.
These are the stations we need to get to the end, but however cheerful and turnful it has been, it may give the impression of a children's film a little too much.
The outcome is rather mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, I have the question: can't the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day work week while paying the British a five-day work wage
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical draft: the introduction of a four-day working week, all with employees working for five days' wages.
The party is said to also want workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) so that company leaders would provide workers with an extra day off due to increased revenue.
According to the draft, workers would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to sources, the idea would fit into the party's economic program, which aims to tilt the balance sheet on the side of the workers in the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Trade Union Congress, so that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's program that would tilt the balance sheet language towards the workers in the economy, and it also fits the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, with the Green Party campaigning with the promise of the four-day working week already in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not have the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
Labour spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not a party-sponsored policy, and the issue is not even on the agenda."
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell presented his idea of a socialist revolution affecting the economy at the Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to fight to regain power from "faceless directors" and the "beneficials" of overhead companies.
If the shadow finance minister's plans were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not get their full profits back, since a Labour government would make "deductions" as punishment for perceived harmful activities.
McDonnell further confirmed that he plans to also make workers members of the board of directors and establish Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of private sector companies' shares to employees, who could thus gain a dividend of £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy revealed on "60 Minutes" whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a final vote on Kavanaugh's election as supreme judge will be held at least a week later than the original date.
In an interview with "60 Minutes" scheduled for airing on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his colleague in South Carolina.
“I mean, of course, ” said Kennedy.
- That's what I said before the hearing. I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, after the charges were filed, and I asked him ‘Did you do it?'
His answer was firm and clear."
Graham's vote, however, appears to be concrete-proof.
“I’ve already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take extremely serious accusations to change my mind, ” said Graham.
— Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett emphatically denied the allegations, added Graham, addressed to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And none of the people named by Dr. Ford confirmed the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will come out."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
The annual music event in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival, will begin on Saturday. World stars will perform at the festival to stand up for a truly noble goal: global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival is now held for the seventh time, and tens of thousands of people are expected to fill Central Park's Great Plant, where participants will not only be able to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes' performance, but will also be able to draw attention to the real purpose of the event: eradicating deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international advocacy group aimed at eradicating poverty by involving more and more people active in the fight against poverty.
Free tickets to the concert (unless they are willing to pay for VIP tickets) can be given to those who undertake to perform certain tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending emails to a leading politician, a phone call, or any other meaningful activity to raise awareness for the purpose of the project: eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen actually been in achieving the goals set over the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective means of rewarding people with concert tickets to convince others of the importance of action, or is this just another form of so-called "cliquetivism" when people feel they have actually contributed to a case by signing or writing an online petition?
Since 2011, Global Citizen figures show that more than 19 million "acts" have been carried out by project promoters serving many different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions contributed to the allocation of $37 billion by world leaders to policies and commitments against poverty that could affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements were from their actions, $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected during fundraising.
The group estimates that the money collected has already had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors to "help children achieve their inherent potential". The organization promised Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate starvation after receiving over 4,700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can banish social injustices and malnutrition among footnotes in history books," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the United Kingdom for more than 5,000 actions to improve the food of mothers and their children, the government allocated funds to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve food for 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions published on the Global Citizen's website is: "Why do you think deep poverty can be eliminated?".
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey, in which we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like earlier civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we achieve our goal because together we are stronger."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year's New York event, and the hosts will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: United States would use a naval "block" to obstruct Russian energy exports
"If necessary", Washington would even use the Navy to counter the marketing of Russian energy supplies, such as Russian energy could not reach the Middle East, American Home Secretary Ryan Zinke was quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria, particularly as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is merely an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
"I think they're only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Home Secretary, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America can use its Navy to ensure that sea routes are open and can block them if necessary. Thus, it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed his words to participants in an event organised by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance – otherwise the non-profit group defines itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's action against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned in the same way: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones," Zinke said while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing out the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump government's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, forcing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, senior officials of the Trump government, including the President himself, persuade Germany to back out from behind the "incorrect" pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if implemented, makes Germany a "hostage" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the existing capacity, is an exclusively economic project, bringing it up to 110 billion cubic metres.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so violently opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is an expression of unfair competition.
"I assume we are in the same position that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans' attempt to convince backfired because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy, as it does to stay away from bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it problematic when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Association (BDI), after the last meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts "takes serious consideration" to run for presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would "really consider" running for president
Warren confirmed at a town meeting in Holyoke in Massachusetts that he would consider running.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and put in place a poorly functioning government, and it’s time for a woman to become president, ” Warren said, according to The Hill.
– After November 6, I will seriously consider running for the presidency."
At the town meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said that he believed he was "taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I pay close attention to what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," Warren said.
Warren outspokenly criticized Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course there is a need for FBI investigation before the vote."
However, based on a survey published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters in Massachusetts do not think Warren should run for president in 2020.
Based on a survey by the University of Suffolk Political Analysis Center and the Boston Globe, 58% of the Massachusetts electorate who voted for Warren with "a good chance" said the Senator should not run for presidency, while
32% support Warren's presidential nomination.
According to the survey, former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy for president would be supported by the majority of those polled, 38%, and 48% would oppose it.
The 2020 presidential election included the names of high-ranking Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden, or Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
As reported by the Associated Press, Biden decides to run until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after applying in September
He was arrested on charges of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through since he returned home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD, and the wounds our soldiers are going home with," Sarah Palin told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Oklahoma.
He called Palin's son's arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son, like other war veterans, "returned in change, hardened, and kept thinking about whether due respect was attached to the service that their comrades, pilots and all other members of the army had done for the country."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said that Track Palin was also reported to have committed domestic violence with a gun and drunk.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy whereby asylum cannot be granted to those fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different Member States, as well as Washington D.C., wrote an expert letter Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker attacking policy in court, writes NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not made public.
The plaintiff woman claimed that her partner and “sons of a violent gang of criminals” assaulted her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She's being held in custody in Texas.
Prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum applications submitted to the United States come from, since violence by criminal gangs and domestic violence is a continuing problem in these countries.
The new U.S. refugee policy withdrew a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) to allow immigrants without documents to submit asylum applications in order to escape domestic violence.
The Attorney General of Karl Racine, Washington, D.C. stated in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Under federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed according to the facts and circumstances in which they exist and such an obstacle violates this principle," states the expert letter.
Prosecutors also explained in the letter that immigration policy harms the American economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "fill the lowest level of jobs."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
"Immunity is due to a person who leaves his country because of racial, religious reasons, nationality, belonging to a specific social group, persecution or justified fear of persecution due to political convictions," said Sessions when announcing the policy, on 11 June.
Asylum is not designed to solve all people's problems around the world every day – however serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead has doubled, rescue units are racing with time
The situation of the survivors is getting hopeless.
“Everyone is very tense, ” says Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, while calming her feverish son in an evacuation center of disaster - stricken Palu.
- Paramedics are bringing in the bodies every minute.
We barely have any drinking water."
Some residents returned to their demolished homes to rescue what was still salvageable from the wet things.
Hundreds have been injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are unable to cater to people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, with a broken spine and shoulder, were transported to Palui Military Hospital. Patients were provided outside the hospital building due to high-strength aftershocks.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he recalled the way the fifth floor hotel room, in which he and his wife and daughter were staying, shook into the devastating uproar.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I was trapped within the fallen walls – Haris told the Associated Press and then added that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying out for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of luring the country with propaganda ads
The Chinese ambassador to the United States accused Beijing of distributing propaganda in the American press a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily that emphasized the mutual benefits of US-Chinese trade relations.
US President Donald Trump referred to his advertisement published in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper sold, last Wednesday, while accusing China of attempting to intervene in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections. China denies the charge.
Trump's accusation of Beijing trying to intervene in the U.S. elections is, according to some U.S. officials declaring to Reuters, a new stage in Washington's ever stronger action against China aimed at putting China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertisements, there is an increasingly intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which more and more duties are imposed on each other's imported products.
According to American and Chinese experts, duties imposed by the Chinese in response at the beginning of the trade war sought to target exporters of states in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including in Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese ambassador to the United States and former Iowa governor serving for several terms, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and shops, for Iowa State exports significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China is even further upsetting our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the highly cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements placed in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
– However, if we go to a newspaper vendor in Beijing, we can hardly find articles with critical voices. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect Chinese people's differing views on the increasingly gloomy growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Communist Party of China."
Branstad added that “one of China's most renowned newspapers refused to bring down” his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans can alienate female voters before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh scandal
Analysts say that it could be counterproductive for many high-ranking Republican politicians to defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, in particular to lose the support of female voters before the midterm elections.
The incident sparked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn, claims Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School institution of the University of Syracuse, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the FBI investigation proposed at the last minute by Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake would be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor November," said a Washington, D.C.-based newspaper, according to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday.
According to Mic, on Friday morning some protesters in the Senate corridor chanted, "November is coming up!" because despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Justice Commission under Republican control decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will leap to an amazing extent," said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
“Many say that it has already been very high, and that is true.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban insecure female voters and young people (18–29 years old) who, while not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go to vote."
Analysts even before Ford's public testimony assumed that he could strike back at Republicans if they continued to stand up for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has described in detail in his testimony why he accuses the supreme court candidate of sexual harassment.
"The Republican Party has landed on quagmire ground," said NBC News at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee.
"This is not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, but also about the way Republicans handled the case and how they behaved with Ford," stressed Guy Cecil, director of the United States of Priorities assisting in the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that Americans are quite divided in whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is considered true. Kavanaugh is believed a little more than Ford.
Based on a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents fully or more believed Ford's testimony, and 35% of respondents at Kavanaugh gave the same answer.
Additionally, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed Ford did.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is the allegations of another of Kavanaugh's accusers, Deborah Ramirez, writes the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee a week ago that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh drunkly harassed him.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the World Wide Web would launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup with the aim of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access individual information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to "acquire control of the world."
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
– It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online repository", also known as POD.
This may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online repository is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access your data.
The company calls this "the realization of the right of individuals to self-determination over data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company is responsible for providing resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, world technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using devices available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not ask "Facebook and Google to introduce full-change technology that would completely turn the business models of companies upside down overnight."
"We don't ask permission from them."
In the entry published on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Technical University.
Berners-Lee has been an important opinion-former in recent months in discussions surrounding the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute despite the launch of Inrupt.
"I am endlessly optimistic about the next era of the World Wide Web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann, a minister serving in the First World War with the Victoria Cross, was celebrated
The only Anglican minister to receive the Victoria Cross is celebrated by his hometown 100 years after he carried out his exploits in World War I.
Reverend and Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann earned the medal during the September 29, 1918 attack on Bellenglise and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew that he had earned the highest honor of the British armed forces.
The memorial stone in his honor was unveiled by his two grandchildren at the Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “symbolically important” that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather's honorable act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal on 29 September 1918 "amid dense fog and fierce cannon and machine gun fire".
Later he rushed to the front line and headed the battalion with “exceptional heroism”, after which he stormed a camp-gun task force by himself, disposing of three members of it.
Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel were shot on 4 October 1918 by a German sniper – just a month before the war ended.
"I know I can never measure up to what my grandfather did and it taught me humility," said Michael Vann, 72, about his grandfather.
After the march led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann also wreathed the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said that he felt it was an honor to play a part in the ceremony and added: “The valor of a true hero is attested by how many people later express their respect to him.”
MMA fans kept on the watch all night so they could watch Bellator 206 broadcast, instead they got Peppa pig.
Imagine you were on the watch all night so you could watch the exciting Bellator 206, and the broadcast was canceled.
The San José show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live at night in the UK as part of the main competition show, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, England viewers were not surprised by Peppa's pig instead of the game.
This was resented by many who had stayed up until the early hours of the morning because of this very clash.
Instead of the MMA game, the children's cartoon film was labeled a "some kind of sick joke" on Twitter by one of the fans.
“According to state regulation, at 6 a.m., this kind of content could no longer be broadcast by the network, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator’s Communication and Marketing Division, regarding the broadcast.
- Yes, it's Peppa, the pig's time."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator company, promised that in the future the schedule of the show would be revised to include UK viewers.
“I think that we can resolve this by repeating,” said Coker.
– However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday on our time, which is Monday, we cannot remedy the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But it wasn't that, it was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that something like this will not happen next time.
Instead of the six so far, there will be only five matches in the program – we wanted to please the viewers very much, but we miscalculated.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex over his sexual orientation
diving Olympian Tom Daley said that in his youth he felt inferior to anyone because of his sexual orientation, but from this he drew the motivation to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he did not realize that “not everyone is like him” until high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs radio show, she told host Lauren Laverne that she stands up for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He added that since becoming a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long years of the show, Kirsty Young, missed several months due to illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley invited me as a "boat wreck" said that as a young man he felt "less than anyone else" because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day it is the feeling of inferiority and disunity from which I draw endurance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth something, too, so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist diving has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, asked the world's governments to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to live his life openly without negative consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that he was "completely surprised by the situation" when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and the Academy Award-winning screenwriter 20 years older than him were married last year, and he claims that the age difference between them was never a problem.
“If you go through so much in your youth,” he said, “you were in your first Olympics at the age of 14, and your father died of cancer three years later, then you find it difficult to find someone of your own age to experience similarly extreme experiences.
The couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley's own statement said it completely turned his attitude toward the world upside down.
“If I had been asked this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing was to win a gold medal, ” he said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child's name became Robert after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley's statement, his father refused to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics as he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I was unable to answer him, ‘Dad, you will no longer be in the front row,' he quoted.
"I held his hand when his breathing stopped, but until that moment I couldn't accept that my father was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there is nothing better than that,” he said.
The song Heather Small Proud (Proud) helped her a lot during the Olympic preparation, and she still gets goose bumps when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts on Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and sidelined Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson can set a record by participating in his 47th Cup game at the Ryder Cup Sunday, however, he must regain his form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays for the 12th time as a record in the biennial event, however, due to his performance in the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday, team captain Jim Furyk sent him to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events at the major tournaments winning five wins, as often as it was when the United States had to fight for victory, he now cheers for his team in one half of the day, spending the other half practicing on the field and trying to correct errors weakening his game.
At the height of his career he was never one of the most accurate batsmen, so the 48-year-old player does not really have the narrow track of Le Golf National, where high grass costs a very high price for faulty punches.
And if the track alone wasn't scary enough, Mickelson would face the English champion Francesco Molinari, who had won all four games this week with the starting Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans starting with a four-point disadvantage ahead of 12 singles matches start strongly, Mickelson's game may be crucial.
Furyk claims to trust the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of his role in today’s development. He patted me on the back, put his arms around me and promised that he would be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
- He's very confident.
He's one of the biggest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
Basically, I didn't plan two games for him.
I was planning on doing more, but in this particular situation, we decided it was the best option.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's appearance on Sunday, he will break Nick Faldo's record, for whom no one has ever played more games at the Ryder Cup.
This allows you to close a series at the Ryder Cup far below the player's performance in singles.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws, however Furyk emphasized that the presence of the veteran player also brings tangible benefits to the team.
“Funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke around with others, a great team member, ” he explained.
– I think the younger players also enjoyed the games played against him, and it's good to see that.
His presence goes beyond playing in a strict sense."
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if one gets in with a significant advantage to the last day of the Ryder Cup holding individual games, luck can easily turn its back on him.
The Danish player made their first appearance in a 1997 game in Valderram, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros took a five-point lead against the Americans, and by the end they only managed to hold a hair of advantage for the 141⁄2–131⁄2 win.
"We must always remind ourselves that we have gained a great advantage in Valderrama in vain, yet we have won by a hair, and we also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we eventually lost," said Bjørn in the picture after the 5–3 victory of the 2018 class on Friday and yesterday, leading 10–6 on the Le Golf National track.
– It is enough to think about previous years' competitions, and already everyone can see that the game is not over.
Tomorrow you'll have to play with full strength.
So go ahead and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have our goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on.
As I said before, I deal mostly with the 12 players of our team, however we also have to pay attention to the other side, who happens to be one of the world's greatest players."
Proud of the team’s hard track performance, Bjørn added: “I would never make predictions in this situation.
Tomorrow's a whole different story.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different from team play.
It feels great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand up individually, you find out in every way what a golfer he really is.
That's what we have to make the players understand, that tomorrow they're gonna make the best of themselves on the field.
They must be separated from their companion, who will also have to make his best form."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opponent's team, expressly trusts that his players perform better in singles than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections: he was part of the winning team in Brookline, then he was on the losing side after the featary performance of the European team, referred to as the "medinah miracle".
“I remember every damn word, ” he replied when he was asked as he encouraged players before the last day of team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
– We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we are best off with a start as fast as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
If one team really gets into it, it puts the opponent's players under enormous pressure during the middle games.
Accordingly, we have compiled the order and prepared our players so that they can perform a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of leading the efforts to turn the job around and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
"I chose this order because I think this is how the picture fits together from beginning to end," added Bjørn to the individual line-up.
Once again, the transfer of Germany's newest warship has been postponed.
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs this will wait for at least next year.
The inauguration of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate flagship "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed to the first half of 2019, wrote the weekly Die Zeit citing a spokesman for the army.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but continued delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
The Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg-class ships back in 2007 to replace the Bremen-class aging frigates.
It is believed to have a high-fire cannon and will be equipped with various anti-aircraft missiles and cloaking technology, including a signal suppressant that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it needs less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from mother ports.
However, due to the ongoing slippage of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may become obsolete as soon as they are finally put into service, noted Die Zeit.
Frigate F125 of heavy fate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to inaugurate the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
There is little information on the reasons for the return, but German media mentions several critical “software and hardware errors” that render the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software gaps are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the Baden-Württemberg-class warships, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is extremely overweight, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further modifications later.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar class ships put in command by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including crew training, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) while the initial plan counted at EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of the warnings that Germany's presence at sea is being reduced.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, recently admitted that the Navy was "starting to run out of warships in a state of control".
According to the civil servant, the problem had become a self-exciting process in the meantime, as old ships had to be decommissioned, but no more ships could be used to replace the outfalls.
He expressed concern that not one of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates was able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is searching for the secret life of bats
New research is underway on a Scottish-Highland estate aimed at finding out how bats exploit landscape features during hunting.
Researchers hope to gain new information about the behaviour of single flying mammals from the results, which may also benefit from subsequent species conservation initiatives.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will investigate the behavior of common and soprano dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden area in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at the appropriate points of the area to record bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will be using handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
Detailed analysis of the recording audio can determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species are doing.
Researchers also make habitat maps and reports to determine in detail how animal behaviour is shaped depending on landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation advisor, hopes that the results will show what are the most important habitats for bats and how any species uses them.
This information helps to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the development of meadows, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have fallen considerably over the last century.
Construction and landscaping work disrupt animals' sleeping areas and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and street lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are flypapers placed, certain chemical processes used for building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really completely blind.
However, because of their nightly predatory nature, they rely much more on their hearing when hunting prey than on their sight.
By using their sophisticated technique based on the reflection of ultrasound, they can determine the exact position of insects as well as the landmarks on their way.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings across the country, 38 gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land, takes bats issue very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleeper studies and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threate estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to estate manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here, in Threade, bats have a great place, ” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else needed for a good living space.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel good about themselves."
He also highlighted the importance of making sure that bats live there before the renovation of buildings, as destroying a single colony could result in the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, harassment, and habitat tampering are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also requested the help of the population.
He said: “There is still much we do not know about bats, and we have almost no information on the situation of the population of most domestic species."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, his lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him "false news".
The footballer's lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who brought the charges.
A Portuguese frame member and the striker of Juventus were charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142 million fan base in an Instagram Live video a few hours after the charges went public that the news was "a lie."
“No, no, no, no and no.
The things that have been said about me today are all lies," said the five-time gold ball player to the camera.
“They want to use my name to get in the public eye.
It happens.
They want to be famous by my name, that's the life of public figures.
I'm a happy man and my life is fine," added the player accompanied by a smile.
Because of the allegations called "unacceptable, privacy-infringing suspicion", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, writes Reuters.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz's statement, the player will file a claim for compensation "to the extent appropriate to the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights committed in recent years."
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man anally raped a woman, standing in documents filed with the District Attorney's office in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent a good boy” except for “one percent”.
Based on the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with her, but he believed that all of this had been done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police, and in a hospital he had a visual of his injuries, but later he agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "fearing retribution" and "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman would now like to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by this incident continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was facing a transfer at the time of the alleged attack (putting him on Manchester United from Real Madrid), and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK "will regret the loss of car factories forever"
The UK will "forever regret" if, after Brexit, it loses its world-leading position as a car manufacturer, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car company will be forced to temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
According to the Japanese car company, in the case of an unagreed Brexit, jobs could be lost due to delays at the borders.
Last year, the plant unit in Burnaston, producing Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I see that if the UK falls out of the EU at the end of March, production shutdowns will take place at the factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) also expressed concerns about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW stated that it would close its Oxford plant producing Minikets for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, with parts coming from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances at borders may, according to industry representatives, lead to delays in production and shortages of parts.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store more than a day's supply of spare parts at its plant in Derbyshire and therefore stop production.
Clark said his plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was "precisely designed to avoid late checks at the border."
“We need an agreement. We want an agreement with the best possible conditions, which will not only bring fruit to our current successes, but also offer new opportunities,” said BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our currently highly successful supply chain."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would last, however it warned that the added-up costs could worsen the competitiveness of the factory in the long term, which could eventually result in job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked 24 years at the plant in Burnaston and is currently active on behalf of the Unite union, the union members are increasingly concerned: "I experience that jobs that have ceased to exist at this time will never be returned."
A government spokesperson said: "We have developed a concrete and feasible plan for future EU relations."
They can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, said the White House
"They may postpone another week" a high-profile meeting between Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump, as the debate over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, released a statement Sunday by the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence on the elections, possible links between Trump advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months in Washington, it has been speculated whether Trump will eventually discharge the Assistant Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
According to this month's report from the New York Times, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting wired to record a conversation with the president, and the question was also raised as to whether it would be possible to replace Trump under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied what was said.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House and was rumoured to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then present before the United Nations in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "wrongly" dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflicting with the Senate Judiciary hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh, with which the decisive Senate vote was further delayed.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made a visit to Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a date for now or we can set it for this week, but in the light of the cases in the supreme court, I see some opportunity for another week’s delay.
I'll soon find out, and as always, I'll notify the press."
However, some journalists were skeptical about this statement: Sanders had not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace also asked about the reason for this.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the press conferences was not the cause of television reporters' opposition to the "sensationist" behavior, but he added: "I do not dispute the fact that they are indeed sensational seekers."
He then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and press representatives would take place more frequently.
“The president is interviewing more questions and answers than any previous president,” he said. He even added, without substantiating the claim, “We looked at the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is better to talk to me by light years.
We often try to do this, and there have been many such occasions over the past few weeks, so they can speak to the President of the United States personally instead of the White House press conferences."
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or possibly press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences held alone are quite rare.
Why, it may be inferred from what happened this week when the president made an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance in New York City in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health department sent a letter to NHS Scotland employees in the European Union for concerns about Brexit
The head of the health department expressed the country's gratitude in a letter to its employees from the countries of the European Union of the NHS in Scotland and stressed that they hope to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's expected exit.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover costs related to the established legal status applications of EU citizens working in decentralised public service.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, resulting in a decision expected to be taken in the autumn.
The UK Government has also embarked on the preparation of a scenario that may not be agreed.
I know what a disturbing time this must be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Employees from different EU Member States and other countries have valuable experience and expertise in helping the health care portfolio, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home, and we would very much like you to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent urgent surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a game ending in a 31–27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He walked out to the shoreline and just collapsed," Reed said.
The coaching team and members of the health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the track, then put him on a stretcher, and took him for further investigations.
One of the authorities at Tennessee State in Nashville, Tennessee told Chris Harris, a WSTV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond the surgery that was performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "he does not yet know any further details about the type and extent of the injury," while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore student set aside for a year, spends his first season on the Tennessee State team, to which he re-certified from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful tackles before leaving the field, so he is already at 18 in the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees for real estate purchased in the UK
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher levy on property purchased in the United Kingdom, and with the additional income from this they would support the homeless
This step would neutralize Corbyn's success among young voters
The increase in the levy is aimed at those who are not taxing in the United Kingdom
According to the Treasury's calculations, this would mean an annual revenue of £120 million, which would be used to support the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher levy on properties purchased in the UK, and the additional income from this will be used to support the homeless, reporting Theresa May at a press conference today.
The goal of the move is probably to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he achieved by promising more affordable housing and measures for high-income voters.
The increase in the levy will affect individuals and companies who are not taxing in the United Kingdom and the additional income from this will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional charge added to the current levy, which, in addition to the higher levy on second dwellings and properties purchased for expenditure purposes two years ago, could reach up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects an annual revenue of £120 million as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by citizens outside the United Kingdom, causing a significant price increase, causing the situation of the first home buyers to become increasingly difficult.
Many of the rich districts in the country have become "spirit cities", especially in the capital city, as many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in taxes to help young people preparing to wait for their first home.
He personally considers large construction companies to be responsible for keeping property prices high, who have become a habit of buying and leaving areas on the lam. He has asked May to abolish quotas for affordable houses and to do something about the "housing market shame" situation in the country.
Corbyn announced notable proposals for a series of housing reforms, which also includes rent control and the elimination of evictions without a valid reason.
It would also provide councils with more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I would like to devote my premiership to restoring the English dream and to making life ever better for each generation.
For this to happen, the situation in the real estate market needs to be settled.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country, as well as companies with foreign interests, to purchase real estate as easily as hard-working citizens in England.
Dreams woven from their own home have become almost unattainable to too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too attainable."
Jack Ross: "My greatest desire is to be the manager of the Scottish team"
According to Jack Ross, Sunderland coach's statement, his "highest desire" is to become manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenges of resurrecting the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first-class league, only three points behind the first-place finish.
He moved his seat to the stadium named Stadium of Light after successfully returning the St. Mirren team to the first-class Scottish Football Championship the previous season.
“I also wanted to play for my country as a player.
Unfortunately, however, I only managed to get into the reserve, said Ross on Scottish BBC Sportsound.
When I was a kid, I watched a lot of Scottish team play in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
Now, however, the only way I have a chance is to succeed as a club manager."
In his position as manager of Sunderland, Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach is not nervous about having to follow in the footsteps of such great names, and had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“At the moment, success is measured by whether or not I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly the place for the first-class league, he said.
– It will not be easy to get back, but it is more than likely that I will only see my activity here as a success if I manage to get the club back."
Ross's career as manager began just three years ago, after serving as an assistant coach for a time with the Dumbarton team, as well as spending 15 months in Hearts' coaching guard.
He then helped Aolla recover after the team fell back into the third tier and won the title with St. Mirren on the verge of losing the following season.
Ross claims to feel more confident now than ever during his playing career, either for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real defining moment, ” he recalled as the coach of Alloa.
– I clearly thought that managing was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird because I've done well, I've had a pretty good life out of it, and I've actually had some really memorable moments.
Players' lives, however, are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every single week.
Of course, I still have to cope with the stress and pressure of work, but management tasks lie with me.
I've always been interested in managing, and now that I've had a taste of it, I feel better about myself as a grown-up."
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound's Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 local time to 13:00 on Radio Scotland channel.
According to one study, beer is best served at 5:30 on Saturday afternoon
In the summer heat wave, traffic in England pubs in difficulty has increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under pressure.
Based on the data collected, pubs and bars' income increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurants' income decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business consulting firm compiling statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunny period and England’s longer-than-expected world championship appearance, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs experienced a 2.8% increase in revenue, except that even more declines than restaurants could be observed.
Restaurant revenue decline of 1.8% in June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sold alcohol, performed best, producing even more growth than the loss at restaurants.
Pubs offering more food were also unpleasantly affected by the sustained sunshine, although not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
It seems like people prefer to drink at a time like this.
The revenue from drinks pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month, and food revenues fell by 3%."
According to Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and catering industry: “These results have followed the trend since the end of April.
Weather, as well as major community and sporting events, remain the main revenue factor in the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual revenue decline of 4.8% can become particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressure.
Couldn't have come at a worse time for long, hot summers for restaurants operators, and it will only be revealed over time whether the more moderate weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well."
Total revenue growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, which also reflects the slow pace of introducing new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales of the UK hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry degree measure, collects and analyses performance data from an operator group of over £9 billion in total turnover of 47 members.
One child out of five has a social media account that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one in five children (up to 11 years old) have a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta fakes" is increasing
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students responded that they have a "head" account that their parents can see
One child out of five (as early as 11 years old) creates a social media account that he hides from adults.
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta branches" is rapidly increasing, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students responded that they have an immaculate “head” account that their parents can see, but also create private accounts.
A mother who happened to find her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret side found a teenage profile that said “rape me. ”
According to a research conducted by Headmasters‘ and Headmistresses‘ Conference (HMC), representing the directors and principals of Digital Awareness UK and independent schools, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% have admitted that they have private branches.
"I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them," said HMC leader Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "sound of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and according to board chairman Ian Beattie, sports decision-makers will be invaluablely helped by the wide international experience of athlete over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and his presence will help the development of Scottish athletics," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am pleased to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help the Scottish sports leaders."
Two of the four Olympic gold medals of American athlete regularly reporting as an expert at the BBC won at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in 200 metres and 400 metres, but was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circulation disorder.
He wrote on his Twitter page: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that in time, it would be decided if I would ever recover.
I'm trying to be human, but I've recovered completely, I can walk again, I'm going to agilitation practice today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages."
A breast-sucking advertisement like a mother's cow shares the online community
An ad by a company producing breast-suckers that compared breastfeeding mothers to milk cows created a heated online controversy.
Elvie claims to have developed "the world's first quiet, wearable breast pump", and their product's appearance was advertised in an ironic commercial evoking music videos that showed what freedom the device gives mothers who milk their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of straw, while in the background they hear the lyrics featuring the following lines: "Yes, I milk myself, I don't have a dick" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, but my breasts."
And the chorus reads, "I pump, I pump, the baby eats big, I pump, I pump, I milk chicks."
The advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page soon became a crossfire of online disputes.
The video reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of comments indicating mixed reception. According to many, advertising mocks the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“Promising the product with very distasteful cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give birth to offspring, but their wines are taken away from them within days," recalls one commentator.
The Elvie Breast Cleaner can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for both the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast suction to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added: “It’s a completely insensitive ad."
Others came to the defense of the advertisement, a woman admitted that she believed the video was "terrifyingly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it right away if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not even trying to get into it anymore.
The product is brilliant," he wrote.
Another commentator said: “This is a funny ad for mothers milking their milk at work or in a toilet, who feel “cow ” because of it.
It does not glorify or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they had the discreet buster in their bras all the time while dancing.
The campaign builds on the feeling that women who use breast suckers sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not employ wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra, so women can move freely, control their children, or even go out while breast-sucking.
Ana Balarin, co - owner and communications director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product and therefore had to be advertised in a bold, provocative manner.
Pointing out the parallel between milking women and milking cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast-suckers and to show in a funny way how our breast-sucker provides a sense of freedom compared to this."
Elvie's breast pump wasn't on the news for the first time.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother of two entered the runway in Marta Jakubowski's dress while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
A record has been reached for the number of children detained, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This can be partly explained by the fact that it is harder to find host homes for them due to the harsh rhetoric of the Trump administration and its actions to date.
Hosts are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and fear that they would compromise their chances of staying in the country if they applied to receive children.
This threat continued to grow in June when it was announced that parents applying to the host and adults living in the same household would have to give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement made before Congress last week that dozens of people who had applied to receive unaccompanied minors were arrested.
The office later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"80% of those who apply to be recipients and those who live in the same household reside illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we continue to search for such individuals," Albence stated.
In order to speed up the proceedings for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear before the court within one month of being detained instead of 60 days so far, the social workers claim.
Many sign up in court via a video conference call instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant is quickly deported.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer the detention takes, the more nervous and depressed the children become, and the chances of violent outbursts or attempts to escape increase.
According to law defenders, these risks are only increased by a larger facility like the one in Tornillo, where it is more difficult to detect those in need of psychological care due to the number of children.
They added that if they do not give the children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before transferring them to such a facility, they will expose them to even greater trauma.
Syria called for immediate departure from the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the civil war that raged in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also held the position of Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces had entered Syrian territory illegally citing the fight against terrorism, and "this is how they will be treated."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moulem asserted that “the war on terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He stated that Damascus "continues his holy struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria" of terrorist groups and "the illegal foreign presence."
2,000 soldiers from the United States reside in Syria, most of them assisting Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad as trainers and advisers.
France sent over 1,000 soldiers to the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moulem claimed that the conditions were right for their return and that only "some Western countries" aroused "irrational fears", deterring refugees from returning home.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the population return home,” he said.
– They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide rebuilding aid to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and his opposition on the conclusion of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a buffer zone for the last big citadel of insurgents around Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a widespread attack on the province of three million inhabitants.
At the same time, Moulem stressed that the agreement set out "clear deadlines" and indicated his hope that military actions would be directed against only jihadists, including the an-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which should be "rootedly exterminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of delegates from the government and opposition may soon be convened, tasked with preparing the post-war Syrian constitution and preparing elections.
Moualem considers the participation of the Syrian government in the committee to be acceptable, for example, only "reviewing certain articles of the current constitution" and warns all external actors against interfering with the process.
That's why they're gonna re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020 unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true and a impeachment procedure or scandal prematurely ends its presidency.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential finale of all time.”
For now, however, viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, CNN's primetime ratings have increased nearly double, to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its ratings, to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" running on MSNBC is the most watched cable TV show with its own 3.5 million audience, achieved on evenings of major news days.
“We are drawn to us like fire because it is something we do not understand," said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s drama series “The Designated Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranking miniser of the cabinet sits in the chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys‘ Club", has a different opinion.
This is how he recalls a road trip to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why," asked Scovell.
“Because he makes me laugh,” replied the driver.
This is the entertainment of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade precedents as to whether immigrant families and the stability of the world economy can be reunited.
Only a very narrow layer can do that to ignore these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information when we have been staring at a debate show for the sixth hour about the authenticity of anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward's book "Fear", or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("the garb of embodied arrogance" as drafted by The Washington Post), or his description of Stormy Daniels Trump, uh, anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, that's always gonna come back from Super Mario.
“It’s a bit like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, creator of “Wheelstars”. Trump’s show keeps changing characters and daily new turns (he goes to N.F.L., he praises Kim Jongun).
If you miss one episode, you'll be right behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny weather in Kauain, yet he was crouching inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN's show.
He was unable to break away from TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many people said this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization, ” recalled Fleisch.
– I thought they were joking, but they seem to be right."

Both parties pour money into the tightest competitions of the mid-term congressional election
No one was surprised that both parties in Pennsylvania's 17th constituency spend the money uncounted after two active representatives struggle for the same seat after re-drawing congressional districts.
One of the contestants for the recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a by-election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former constituency of 12, which shows significant overlap with today's district of 17.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found in January that former district boundaries were manipulated to the advantage of Republicans.
In the struggle for the 17th District, the funding body of the two parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), almost bid on each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning in close competition the March by-election in Pennsylvania's Congressional Constituency 18 which garnered great attention.
The seat of representatives was for the Republicans for over a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district with a 20-point advantage.
Political experts say Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and then withdrew from the plan
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has barely responded.
Donald Trump negotiated in good spirits with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners forced the Trump Organization leadership team out of there.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recalled senior fellow US branches from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama due to their "decided recent decision not to support Taiwan", previously announced Heather Nauer, a spokesperson for the ministry.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid in 2017, including to combat drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have painfully affected the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As private meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues that would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year and its primary goal was to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would also be speaking at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue condemnation statements or take punitive measures.
White House spokesperson John Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were also supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next blow could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has somehow obstructed justice... and a number of publicly disclosed facts point to that.
Mueller's investigation is also said to include whether Trump's team collaborated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are to be the majority in Congress, they will certainly try to impeach Trump, who, after the voters, may also face the verdict of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump's downfall is far from inevitable... and neither is it for his European principles.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how long the fight will take.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to coup Hitler, just waiting for the West to side with the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
The grant was cancelled, so it was not possible to prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
At historical turning points such as this, it is decided whether the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
In today's America, we can identify several of these turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump replaces Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's seat has wavered since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested recording conversations with the president, and suggested that Trump was unfit to hold his office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
"How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and, despite a credible sexual harassment charge, is appointed a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is, in the by-election, are we voting for a Congress that is ready to impeach Trump?
If we fail these trials, democracy will have a long winter ahead of us.
I hope not, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime once based in a building serving as my ambassadorial home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on the table bearing the sign of swastika during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans playing for Rangers is hopeful before the game against Rapid Wien
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians can secure their participation in the European League Group G following an unexpected draw against Spanish Villarreal.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to enter the season due to his knee injury until a 2–2 game against Villarreal, but feels that building on this result, the Rangers can also set themselves bolder goals.
“It was an important point against a great team called Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we could score, and we did score.
Maybe we could've hit another goal in the end, but we can't complain about a draw.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European match.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were good enough for their last game, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was hard, I got hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, the guys enjoy the game, the workouts are going well.
I hope that if we give it our best shot, we can put the last season behind us and get good results."
Many women worry about not saving enough for their old age
Those in the survey had accurate ideas about their desire for elderly care, but only a small part of them talked to their family members about it.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10% responded that they talked to their children about it.
"Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't usually raise the issue," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's what's worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take proper care of you if you don’t tell them what your needs are in time.
Together with his adviser and family, choose where and what care he desires; these decisions have a significant impact on later costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can give useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be made with a traditional insurance policy designed for old age care, or a life insurance policy combined with hybrid savings that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral... if you have the resources.
Prepare the legal documentation: This will cut the possibility of later litigation in advance.
Entrust a representative, a trusted person, who acts on your behalf on health issues, supervises your medical care and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
You're gonna have to hire someone to handle your finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and arranges for the payment of invoices when you are not able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Suppose your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medicines and allergies?
These data should be recorded in writing so that they are available at any time.
"It's not just financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn't matter who your doctor is," Martin added.
‘What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything must be planned in advance."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives when a massive earthquake hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, and then a tsunami hit the city of Palu, Indonesia.
The region's communications network has also been damaged, so no news has been received from Donggala Governorate north of Palu, where it was the center of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 residents in Palu had to be evacuated.
Some important data about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes Province, built on the west coast of Celebes Island, at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding when it was struck by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Governorate extends over 300 km on the northwest coast of Celebes Island.
The governorate – an administrative region smaller than the province – had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is primarily characterized by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the far side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis on numerous occasions over the past 100 years.
A 1938 tsunami killed over 200 residents and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West Tongala was reached by a tidal wave, at which point nine died.
Indonesia lies in the geologicly active Pacific Fire Ring area, so earthquakes are common.
Just some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a huge seaquake began off the west coast of the province of North Sumatra Aceh, which launched a tsunami reaching 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of the victims being killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias near Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake shook the southern part of Java, Indonesia's largest population island, and the tsunami following it caused almost 700 casualties on the south coast.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake destroyed near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake shook an island in the Mentawa archipelago near Sumatra and sometimes created a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface quake reached the governorship of Aceh Pidie Jaya. The panic and destruction in its wake recalled many of the memories of the terrible tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was created, but still more than 100 residents died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a powerful quake here claimed 500 lives, mainly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the ground, and thousands of tourists are stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was detained on assault charges.
29-year-old Palin lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of committing domestic violence, obstructing the announcement of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, Alaska state police said.
According to the police report, when a lady friend wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su detention facility in custody, with $500 bail on him, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and answered the question of his guilt, "not guilty at all."
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, i.e. up to four years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he is charged with a Class B violation that could entail a one-day detention and a $2,000 fine.
Palin is not in conflict with the law for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently under discussion by the Alaska Veteran Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of reporting the crime, as well as possession of weapons under alcohol influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by several organizations representing veterans when she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 lost their lives following a Friday earthquake on the island of Celebes, Indonesia.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake created a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Systems responsible for power supply and telecommunications have become inoperable, with the number of dead likely to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake was centered near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A number of videos of the tsunami's arrival have been released on social media.
Hundreds gathered at a ceremony on the coast of Palu, when the tsunami landed.
Federal prosecutors have requested the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that claimed eight lives, and no executions have been carried out in the state since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov was charged with driving a truck chartered from Home Depot on a bicycle road on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway in October, running over numerous pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed his eight victims "intentionally" and "intentionally intended" to cause injury, he is in the submission of the New York South District Attorney's Office.
According to the file filed, proof of either of the two charges could justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipop was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of extortion killing, which had been used almost exclusively until then against organized crime, as well as damaging and destroying motorized vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and premeditated intent", states prosecutors, and Saipov, as they put it, carried out his actions in a "horror, cruel, inhumane" manner.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he states in the submission.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has most recently requested the death penalty for a defendant for a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
In a federal case in New York, a death sentence was most recently carried out in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple were convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was pleased to have done so.
Saipov said the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, standing on the indictment.
According to police, he asked for an ISIS flag to be dropped off in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipop, said that they were "understandably disappointed" about the decision of prosecutors.
"We believe that the actual life imprisonment for confession would have been more favourable, with the death penalty only prolonging the sufferings of all the actors involved in the case," claims Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty on their client.
According to a Tory congressman, Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit talks
Nigel Farage stated in a protest during the Tory conference that he was "calling on the people's army to fight".
According to the former leader of Ukip, politicians should feel pressure from Eurosceptics after a fellow party of Theresa May suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone, who did not hold any office, told the attendees of the Birmingham assembly that the United Kingdom would have quit "a long time ago" had Farage been the Brexit Minister.
It is well characterized by pressure within the party on May that the pro-stay Toryk spoke at another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May seeks to implement the Chequers Plan, which requires constant lavishing between Brexit and the pro-stayers and the EU.
According to his allies, despite negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and Labour can only choose from his package or "total chaos".
Bone said in the Leave Means Leave protest held in Solihull (Exit means quitting) that the "Chequers deal" should be dealt with.
He suggested that Farage should be brought into the House of Lords and entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had led the negotiations, we would have quit by now," he stated.
Representative from Wellingborough added: "I stick with Brexit, but the Chequers deal has to be dealt with."
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the assumption that since the 2016 vote the public sentiment had changed: "There is no basis for the British people to change their minds and want to stay."
The pro-Brexit Tory representative Andrea Jenkyns also attended the meeting and told journalists: “All I ask is this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among party membership, and especially among activists who work in the field and helped us get to government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
As a polar message addressed to May, he added: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat."
Farage said at the rally that politicians "should feel the pressure" so that they would not dare betray the result of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is now at stake,” he said.
– They want to betray Brexit, and today we are gathered to send a message that we will not allow them to do so."
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I want our politicians who are about to betray Brexit to feel the pressure.
We call upon the army of the people to win with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom an independent, independent, proud country again."
The pro-stayers, meanwhile, marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Some activists waved the flag of the “Toryk against Brexit” movement formed over the weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis was on the Conservatives for the party's employment due to security errors at the time of the conference's opening.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, border crossing without disruption and free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just bullshitting me.
There is simply no good Brexit," he stressed.
Warren is "considering carefully" to run for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would carefully consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future at a residential forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a regular reviewer of Donald Trump, is preparing for re-election in November against the state Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There have been speculations for some time that he may be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was a meeting of voters in the 36th, residential forum since Trump took office.
A participant asked if he was planning to run for president.
In Warren's response, he said it was time for "women to take part in Washington in restoring the failed government, including taking the supreme position".
Arrested person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU
Police at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that they had arrested the person suspected of shooting the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims dead on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern Coast Time.
They previously released a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was hit by a fatal shot near Southern University university grounds early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the shot, which proved fatal," police captain Murphy J. Paul informed media representatives on Saturday, according to 247 sports reports.
He intervened in defense of Wayde's friend, at which point Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted in interrogation that he was at the scene, he had a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and the man was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge district police station.
In Baton Rouge, he grew up, nearly 2 metres tall Sims played 32 games last season, 10 as a starter, playing an average of 17.4 minutes per game, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came closer to the World Cup title after winning ahead of Sebastian Vettel thanks to team instructions
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a major role in the race.
Bottas, starting from pole position, started well and almost got Hamilton into trouble as he defended his position in the first two laps, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vettel stood in the boxing street and let Hamilton get stuck in traffic behind the midfield, which was supposed to prove decisive.
Mercedes stood out a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a close action during which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the inner arc free after moving twice as a defense in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the rear row of frames and was seventh by the end of the first round.
He then drove for most of the race as he did not change tires so he could quickly finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in hopes of fourth place.
He eventually stood in the boxing street on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, making Räikköné the fourth place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri had done a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let me go.
The team made it with exceptional work to get the first two seats," said Hamilton.
His body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting as the Senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, merely remarking that the things going on in the Senate prove that people are "evil, hateful, and liars."
"What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, is when they see anger when they see people being angry, vile, hateful and lying," he said.
“If we look at the statements and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, well, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? — ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.”
Well, hold on a second.
We leaked?...No, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent by Ford to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked in early September. However, Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims or leak his story," Feinstein told the committee as reported in The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and to keep it confidential as requested."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president, who remarked at the Saturday evening meeting: “I will tell you what is going on: his body language was very bad.
He may not have leaked it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by the three women with the claim that the Democrats would use the alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You can see the vileness, the loathing, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to wade through to gain power and control," quoted the president's words by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in the game against Dundee
With his 5–3 victory on Saturday at the rematch held at Dundee, the Dundee Stars atone for his defeat of the Belfast Giants in the Elite League match on Friday.
Through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants took an early two-way lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home, after which Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.

It was Adam Keefe's players' third Elite League power of the season to beat Dundee 2–1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two sides met for the fourth time in the season, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's goal lead, and four minutes later, assisted by David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In the turnaround opening third, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt from his pass Cownie equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants could march to the break with a lead when he hit his second goal in the evening at the end of the first third.
The home team reorganized their ranks, and Bouchard again equalized with a man advantage goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's all-around game helped Nielsen take the lead for Dundee towards the end of the second third for the first time in the game and then took care of the win with his team's fifth goal at the end of the last third.
The Giants, which thus lost four of their last five games, returned home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller was killed so that hundreds on the aircraft could escape the earthquake
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
Over eight hundred died, and many disappeared after Celebes Island was rocked by a major earthquake on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his post in the wildly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there so Batik Air's flight 6321, now on runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He was later killed in the hospital.
According to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait, the decision could save the lives of hundreds, reported the incident by Australian ABC News.
We had a helicopter prepared from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, however, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were clenched when we heard the news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll may be thousands, according to the country's disaster relief organization, the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to reach.
"The number of victims is likely to increase further, as many are trapped under the ruins and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the organization.
Waves reaching a height of six metres destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry assistance and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Emergency cars bring more bodies every minute.
There's not much clean water.
The convenience stores have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross, running with time, is trying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a real tragedy, but it could be a lot worse.
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask you all to work day and night on the evacuation related tasks!
Are you ready?" CNN coverage.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes at Lombok Island this year, in which more than five hundred and fifty died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says a person has disappeared in a plane crash in the lagoon
According to the latest announcement by an airline operating a flight crash in Micronesia, a Pacific lagoon, one person has disappeared, although it has previously been claimed that the evacuation of all 47 passengers and crew was successful from the sinking plane.
According to the Air Niugini press release, according to the situation Sunday afternoon, he cannot account for a male passenger.
According to the airline, he collaborates with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further information on the passenger, such as questions about its age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the flying crashed into water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been hospitalized.
According to the airline, six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the misfortune and the exact course of events are still unclear.
According to the airline and U.S. Navy, the aircraft landed in the lagoon outside the airstrip.
According to some witnesses, the aircraft missed the airstrip.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the aircraft flew very low.
"It's an awful good thing," Jaynes commented.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to run down to the sinking plane's emergency exits in strong water.
He said the air escorts panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors repairing a wharf nearby also assisted in the rescue and transported people ashore by an inflatable boat before the aircraft sank 30 metres below the water colour.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have been killed in crashes involving airlines with PNG registrations over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor presented it to the prosecution Saturday at the man's retrial, who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He explained to the jury how he put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers with the help of mobile phone records on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several phones, according to which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of the woman's death, which contradicts the man's previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford made his testimony on Saturday, during which he said that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of her death.
According to cell phone records, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that following Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hoptrio called for a negative approach to the genre to the sheep by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hip-hop has distanced itself from its roots dealing with political messages and social problems.
They want to return to these roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sued for dismissal of a party following a "racist" message
A New York nurse filed a lawsuit against a couple for his dismissal as a result of discrimination, after in a message wrongly sent to her, the mother complained that they had managed to employ a "black" nurse again.
The couple denies being racist, and the lawsuit is compared to "extortion".
The mother with two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when she saw the woman black on her first working day at the time of the arrival of the new child care worker Giselle Maurice in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEM, IT’S A BLACK ONE!" wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his blunder, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unpleasant" himself, dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing nurse, who was African-American, had done a bad job and rather expected a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now sues the party for reparation for dismissal and asks for $350 a day compensation for the six-month-long residential work he was originally hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them how to stop the procession, it can't be done like this," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to allegations accusing them of racism that the termination of Maurice's application was reasonable because they feared that they could not trust him after being offended.
“My wife sent him something he did not mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," the husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone who, even if by chance, was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, who likened the lawsuit to "extortion", his wife had the baby only two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation."
“Would anyone attack such a thing?
It's not really nice to do this," added the investment banker.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the public court has already quickly condemned the party in social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
According to a recent letter, the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine ourselves as someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
This information is quite amusing now that we know how huge a success Paddington is."
He said that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before feeling inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, would not have resented having his work rejected and then added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the book had been bittersweet following his father's death last year.
He called Paddington “a very important member of their family” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was not conceited at all," he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child to him who is making a difference: we are proud of him even if it is not really our credit.
I think he saw Paddington's success in some way.
Although he created it and sprung out of his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing, he and his daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain for his life.
"Nad called regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that they didn't expect him to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and then left his system.
He died a long time ago, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait to know it was all over.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a place surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't let myself go."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the others who ignored the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
“I bowed my head, and all this time my tears were falling.
It's hard to explain, but there on the plane, I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."
A postcard with grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards full of inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook, and her grin stuck to everyone.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would make any place feel better."
However, he gave up his work before his death, as he was in ‘very bad condition'."
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that this would cause some kind of domino effect."
Ms. David made the postcards “so that people can know that there are people who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are just friends.
Don't sit quietly – you have to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who had lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of the man's mother.
"He didn't say he was depressed, depressed, or anything," he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in attitude.
He was devastated on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, he wouldn't look them in the eye or anything like that."
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It left a huge void in the family.
It's broken our hearts into little pieces.
But we must continue to fight."

Questioning Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve what he asked for – a limited investigation of limited duration – we might reach agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of "dropping into pieces" due to the party's indecision.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is solely due to timing.
The by-election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are not expected to perform well, it will be much harder for them to get their man into the highest court.
George W. Bush answered the phone to call the senators and lobby them for support from Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he also met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
A vote is held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow the Vice President Mike Pence to make a decision to inaugurate Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's dissidents "declined" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean dissidents on their way to South Korea has declined since Kim Jongun took power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Bjengszok cited data from the Southern Ministry of Unification and said that in the last year there were 1,127 defectors against 2011, when this number was 2,706.
Park said that closer border surveillance between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang did not comment on this information publicly.
Most of the northern dissidents eventually get South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most escape to China, which has the longest border towards North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Dissidents are received by China as illegal immigrants and not refugees and are often sent back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, and their discussion focused on stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came with a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore, where they agreed largely on further cooperation on the nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of advance since then.
"In the absence of confidence in Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is inconceivable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons," Ri said in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric," says he is unfit for Supreme Court
The House's minority president, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court "hysterical" and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to work on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said so in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"It occurred to me unwittingly that if a woman were to behave this way at any time, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi explained his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony, which he had done before the Judiciary Committee of the Thursday Senate.
Kavanaugh protested the rumours that he would sexually harass Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and his voice folded when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
In addition, he explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated character murder", with angry Liberals organizing due to the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was not fit to work on the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I believe that he has ruled himself out with his statements and the conduct he has shown against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh, in case he held the post, and if the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"All I'm saying is that if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where you're at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the Capital Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions about the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether or not he would reverse the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to come to the court and expect us to be happy," Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's a legitimate outburst, anger that's been accumulated for months and years, and it can't come out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so rare, do I?"
“I had a great help from a woman who was working in a position of leadership somewhere, ” he continued. “He told me that he was crying in anger, but he developed a technique according to which, when he started crying in anger, he told his talking partner: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought that was a great idea."
In part, tears are condoned as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early job, an office dominated by men, where I once began to cry in an angry inertia that I was grabbed by an older woman — a cool manager I was always afraid of — and took me out to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be satisfied because they've upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on the hair called Monkey Business, and as a result, he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, figured there was no reason why he could not run for presidency himself.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," he laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they wished for the newer candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone named him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
With the campaign going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder fell behind in raising money, so she vowed not to enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose in the first place.
He realized that some of his supporters had given the men $1,000, but he had only received $250.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?" he pondered.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed with emotion over gratitude for the people who supported him, as well as frustration against the system that made it difficult to raise money and directly reach voters, and rage over sexism that his throat was choked.
"They must have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to it.
“They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Crying"?
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening line fire of the trade war between the US and China was almost deafening, and while the battle was not yet nearly over, the break between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S., launched the first warnings early in the year by levying taxes on the most important Chinese export products including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, as new duties already concern a product worth $200 billion, effectively taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing has fought back, most recently charging between five and ten percent of US products worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you want to get Washington to back down, that would mean giving in to demands, but public bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, the president of China.
Yet, according to experts, if Beijing is doing well in tactics, the US's trade war pressure could be good for China in the long run, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could push any of the economies of the two countries into an economic vortex is much more serious than the observers had previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, research assistant for Asia at the think tank New American Security.
Syria "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed in a war lasting over seven years.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the country's conditions were improving.
"The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to re-establish the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now we have all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and self-made economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN calculations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Moallem said that the Syrian state welcome all assistance to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that no conditional assistance or contributions were accepted from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team 16.5:10.5 at Le Gold National held outside Paris.
The US has now failed on the European scene for the sixth time in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player struggling throughout the tournament, dropped his punch into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the win.
Italian golfer Molinari shone among all of his circles, making him one of the 4 players who had ever achieved the 5–0–0 result since the tournament launched in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to European team lowest ranking player Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 to English Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time top European winner with a career score of 25.5.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy. I'm so happy I got the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I'm happy I could help," he said following Garcia's European victory with emotions.
He hands the baton to Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 single on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, a man I grew up watching," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time to win 14 main titles and preceded only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing results of the United States team captain Jim Furyk, he said that he was “proud of these guys because they were fighting.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup our team, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You guys need to lift your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us."
