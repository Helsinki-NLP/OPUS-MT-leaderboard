It's not that far.
There's a lot of schools in this town.
This town has a big TV station.

It's a gray stone building.
I found it in the attic.

Look at you.
It's time to rest.

That's enough!
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things. Either annihilation, and the dead are unaware of nothing; or, as we are told, a real change: the migration of the soul from this place to another.
Don't hang around.
That was a silly question.
If you read the book, can you lend it to me?
If you'd stop telling me not to be nervous, I probably wouldn't be so nervous.
Of course.
What are you doing?
I'll put my passport back in the vault.
Tom felt it would be a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.
You don't know anything about that animal.
Take care of yourself.

He's been calling me from time to time.
Something's not right.
Don't be condescending.
I need a room near the elevator.

Tell Tomi I'll be back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the glass.
Tom, your fly's open!
The boy was holding a mouse by his tail.

Tomi's coming over this afternoon?
Can you make another appointment?
I gave up too soon.
What are you gonna do there?
It's perfectly normal.
What else?

Everyone's scared.
That's a good sentence.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not drowning.

I want to pay it now.
I want to ask you something.
I answered the question.

That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf, too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit down.
I don't know where I am.
Tom's not very educated.
He's very proud of his talent.

Can you lend me the book when you're done with it?
I already told you that.
That would cause a catastrophic accident in the work area.
What do you think of my theory?
Give me some time to figure out what went wrong.
Tom's not afraid to die.
We don't have enough information.
My home is far away.
The bus is on its way.
There is the largest lake in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Either way, you're gonna have to wait your turn...
I don't speak Turkish.
Tom checked his pockets.
The rain has become even more intense.
Tom does it to everyone.
Are you logged in?
We're about to change that.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
My request was denied.
We were surprised to hear the news.
Don't underestimate yourselves.
I'm Antonio.
This is where I met my friend.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I like to annoy Tom.
Tomi's our son.
He's a stranger.
You can't know the truth.
Tom is also enraged by the slightest critical remark.

Crying turned his eyes red.
You're going there without me.
Tom's gonna starve.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about that.
Have some, please.
We're gonna do this together.
Can you help me, please?
He saw Mary Tom smiling.
He's in a hurry to catch the eight o'clock train.
He was seen as a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you.
Just give me a few seconds.

I don't want to lose this game.
The education system is transforming.
There they are.
Hey.
Tom ate a bowl of blueberries.
I don't feel like getting up.
Thomas thought Mary had financial problems.
When I hear the news, I get goose bumps.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Why should we care about what happens after we die?
We have to help each other.
My dream will come true sometime.
He spent all the money I gave him.
We used to be neighbors.
Do you think I should tell Tom?
What's that worth to you?
You know how to do that?

How old's your back?
I don't have a nickname.
Who loves Tom?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm dying.
What's it made of?
Tom has a scratch on his forehead.
We're cool.
You're smarter than you think.

I don't really want to eat right now.
Tom's happy with his success.
No one's been hit.
You can do that for yourself.
It doesn't take much time.
I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you check his gallery?
At first I was nervous, but then I gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
You have to ask Tom first.
Explain it to me.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
It's frozen somewhere in the mountains.
Tom went that way.
Tom poured milk into his cat's bowl.

Tom should have done a lot better.
Which songs were they singing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Are you or are you not?
Mr. Harrison sat on his verandah in his shirt and smoked his evening pipe.
I don't feel like learning French today.

That was a secret.
I trust him.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.

You can ask me anything at any time.
I love you.
That's not your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
There are two old chestnut trees in front of our house.
They were screaming.
Snowflakes fell on his long, blond hair.
I don't recognize anyone in this picture.
I hope we're not making you uncomfortable.
Let's discuss this outside.
Thomas is studying chemistry.
He's a man of his word.
I'm not expecting any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't put enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I won't pass tomorrow's exam.
The sentence is fine.
New furniture arrived today.
Get on the horse!
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
I'm calling Tom right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
Hopefully things will be okay.

I need more space.
Tom taught me the most of what I know in French.
Shall we have a drink?
He keeps his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard to please everyone.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom makes?
That's not possible.
This world is ruled by evil forces.
He laughed to hide his fear.
I'm in line.
Can I have a kilo of boned tuna, please?
Don't make noise.
The story was real.

I'm sleeping.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain.

We're all safe.
It was a success.
Calm down.
They drank two bottles of wine.
Come tomorrow.
Can we try this?
The table is green.
Tom was supposed to win the race.
It's got to be me, it's got to be subtitled.
I'm not ready to give up yet.

Courage breeds heroes, and trust creates friendships.
Again, he came up with the old story.

Tom did what he wanted to do.
I can see the light.
I'm only as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't talk to me like that.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
He's a vegetable salesman.
You can't always win.
It's a silver coin.
I feel helpless.
Goodbye.
I'm getting fat.
It's already 10:00 in the evening.
The road is full of potholes.

I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm scared of Tomi.
I'm glad we agree on something.
Then the bear ran to the wheelbarrow, threw off his bear skin and touched him with the magic wand the witch gave him. In a moment, the skin turned into a beautiful, moon-woven ballsuit, and the wheelbarrow turned into a carriage, drawn by two dancing steeds.
Don't make any mistakes.
Are you busy right now?
He's giving his time to books.
Is he tall?
I'll wait for Tomi.

I don't like surprises like that.
He was a cruel man.
It's an opportunity.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.

Would you excuse us for just one second, please?
Which one's your beer?
I won't allow them to use my Husqvarna chainsaw.
Everything in the bathroom was tiled up to the ceiling.
I'll read the description to get it started.
There was total silence in the area.
