I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I'm sure I've heard that sound somewhere before.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mom home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It's affecting everyone.
It's not over until we get it over with.
I'll take your seat.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
He came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price of this is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work wasted.
It definitely freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow hasn't stopped.
The snow hasn't stopped.
I don't care if you're coming.
No problem.
No matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it's been poured on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the other day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened early last week.
That was just the day we got married, honey.
There must have been a reason for this.
It was sudden.
This happened when he was out.
It's happened to me several times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should diet.
I think everyone's hungry.

I think I can do this.
I don't think I can kill.

I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I thought I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do that on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think it's true.

I find spiders to be cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense that we're trying to convince him.
I think you did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.

I think we need to be patient.
I think we're going in the wrong direction somewhere.

I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, it would cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the mat, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi still lived in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me.
I'm under his influence.
I was very impressed.
It's an accident!
It's a historical act.
It's hard to put into practice what we talked about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts if it's gonna work.
It's getting very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you started a new business.
It is important that we propagate our tongues in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm can't be turned off.
That's not the best option.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has the problem with.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, the weather's really bad today.
It's really expensive.
It's 30 meters long.
It's time for bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
That's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
It'll be ready when it's due.
It'll be ready by the time it's done.
It'll take you a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
Consequently, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It could be a long time.
This could be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying it out.
I might be late.
He needs to be washed.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
It has to be fixed.
He never existed.
It was never supposed to happen.
I lied to her even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question for you, too.
I took a long bath.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I took care of it.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It was raining yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I train two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I traveled across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep her alive.
I was trying to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'll try to keep an eye out.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big fur cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
It's a good plan, at least on paper.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a watchdog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's all dark out there.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's already 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's already 10:00 in the evening.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same song.
Environmental disaster.
It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
It's a nightmare.
It's freezing.
It's as much art as it is science.
It's all in the past.
She's in school.
It is a very dangerous sport where even a small defect can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a strange question.
That's terrible.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
I'm tired of this day.
It's a tough day.
It's happened before.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since she left me.
That's better.
It's better to water the garden at night.
It's hot.
It's burning.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, I have goose bumps.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you wear a sweater?
It's common knowledge that a bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
It's delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
It seemed like forever to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like yesterday we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
Like you don't want this to work out for me.
Looks to me like you're being honest.
Looks to me like you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
It's expensive.
It's only fair to get the same salary for the same job.
It's not even perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's getting serious.
It's gonna be a tough winter.
It won't be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
It's great you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and sunny all along.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to sleep on.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to say in words.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
Hauntedly beautiful.
He's got a huge head.
Tall.
Kids should be in bed.
Stop throwing money!
It's hotter than usual tonight.
That's illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents are on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It's important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
We have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
You don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's incredible, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just a little further away.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets back in trouble.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
It's laundry day.
It's like an underwater field, and turtles, rays, and sharks above it are like flying creatures.
It's locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
This isn't a bank.
It's not as raving as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That won't happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negociable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
There's no need to cry about it.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't repent.
There's no point crying over the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's definitely impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It doesn't matter if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
“ Three months later, ” Tomi says, “he is fluent in French. ”
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's pouring out of a tub.
He spread his wings.
It's quite amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is manifested in the disparaging of the working class, absolving imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it excites, and in that it sprinkles the core of thought that infinite wars are the causes of man's innate aggressive tendencies.
It's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are nice.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to be home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
Theoretically, it's possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time to pick our tent trees.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time for us to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should get my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's high time we did something about it.
Tom's birthday is today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive for me.
It's too hot for that right now.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn weather.
Colds suck.
It's ugly, flamboyant yellow, and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they won't run you over in the dark!
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It's unlikely anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
She's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's very entertaining.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed.
It's your only option.
A thorough learning of a language takes about 10,000 hours to learn.
You have to be brave to succeed.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took nearly three years to build my house.
Everyone was caught off guard.
It took exactly an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but we finally managed to find him.
I turned into a small alley.
I've been flipping.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer's day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was wrong to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a silly question.
It was a stupid idea.
This was a tragic accident.
It was a really great meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awful weird.
It's been a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was clearly very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost pitch black.
This was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy for me to keep my promise.

You were just buying bread.
You cheated!
You were in love.
You were lucky.
You were intrusive.
You were rude.
You were staring at me.
You're gonna love this game.
You're gonna lose.
You're gonna need a key.
You're not gonna convince him with those words.
You woke me up.
You're not gonna believe what happened next.
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
What I'm about to say, you're not gonna like it.
You're not gonna win.
You're working too hard.
