Do I think I'm sitting next to you?
So there's a fucking shit.

I've been sitting down.
Come back.

Nothing.
He was talking about it.
Can I eat?
Tom's too long.
The child's breathing.
I sleep all day.
Tens, twenty-two, six, five, five, five, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, nine, nine.

Let me go.
I've accepted his invitation.
There are two beautiful girls.
You got your car?
You're very brave.
Don't let me hurt you.
Do you have bikes?
Now the most important thing you can do is keep quiet.
Where's the shop?
Look at Tom.
How long will you stay?
I'm going to school.
I've lost my throat a little bit.
I have a new red car.
I'm a doctor.
Keep a watch on the truck.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
You're not the first man who told me this thing.

Doesn't it work?
He doesn't want to talk about this.
I've learned a lot from you.
Dk me.

I'll come back to you in twenty minutes.
What do you want to be grown up?
I've accepted his invitation.
What does that mean?
I saw Tom tonight.
You didn't understand.
They're all alert.
Would you be able to speak more slowly?
Who's trying to do that?
The woman's eating.
Tom wanted you to take it.

Looking at this.
It's more water.

I shouldn't have to log out.
Why?
Tom's breathing very strong.
I know we still love each other.
Forgive me. I kept waiting for you.
What have you got?
Sit here.
It's too late in the hospital.
He's asking what it can do.
I told them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom's talking.
He explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
This is your business.
Read it first.
How old is your father?
I've seen my mom's busy working on some Zamas.

Wait outside.

Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of that.

Go on.
Everyone saw it.
What time did you spend on the bus?
As Tom was speaking French, I didn't understand anything about him.
I want this girl.
This is a doctor.
What's your father's name?
I want to know who started.

Good news!
"Can you say German?" "No, I can't."

I was so scared.

I was surprised.
Tell Tom.
I don't like it.
I usually eat outside.
Call the doctor!
Why did this happen?
Go over there.
He's a Canadian.
Take it.
Tom saw them.
It's black from the outside.

He has two kids.
Leave Tom.

I want more.
I heard shouting.
Call the police!

I don't blame you.
What does it mean to "Taueba"?
Thank you very much, doctor.
I lost my key.
I'm looking for one of my guys to eat.

No one can know.
Tom tried.
He's an expert.
I'll buy it.
Tom was shot at the door door, but no one came out.
There's a life in life.
Is there room?
Do you understand French?
You're not in a position to claim anything.
He doesn't eat any more than that fruit.
Wherever his dog is behind him.
Don't go.
Don't go.
You want to dance?
How's your daughter?
Where can I get my wallet?
Tom knows everything now.
Stop here.
It's already saved.
Your time is over.
I can't leave you alone.
Talk to me.
Who has it?

Look at this.

Do you understand now?
I'm not driving.
I've heard the call of creation.
It's so funny.
There's a mistake in the bill.
I'm talking.
I'm too long.
It's hot today.
I saw him jump.
Why are you crying?
I don't know who killed Tom.
Is he a teacher?
I don't want you to go.
Go over there.
I lost my key somewhere around here.
He's a good man.
Let's go.

Tom started talking.
Did you get the Tom's message?
I'm ready to start.

Leave it.

Are you okay?
What do you want?
Give me a kiss.
I'll stay here until you come.
Is that your car?
Let me go!
He's talking to French.
Why are you shouting?
Don't fight.
I'm sure I'll come tomorrow.
How long have you been eating lunch?
Stop touching.
Come back.
I'd like to be fat.
Please talk about the crash.
You can eat whatever you want.
Both of them have a lovely girl.
They're staring.
A lot of the Tom's funerals were shared.
I thought it was beautiful.
It's my daughter.
Is it possible to publish it in another language?
I'm just wondering what it's all about.
Are you still reading the book?
He's here.
Where's the road on the magic table?
You should have seen a doctor.
When do you want to go?
I'm breathing.
Tom's injured.
I want a taxi in the morning.
I trust you.
We're inside.
Very good, and you?
'Cause I lost my trust.'
How long did you get up in the night?
I can't take my right hand.
Who's got it?
I can run.
Is he the doctor?
Everyone ran out.
Tom has no proof.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
How old are you?
Everyone's good.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I've been there.
Who are they?
He doesn't want to talk about it and this time.
He made sure he didn't go to the party.
I don't know.
How do you say xX in Damascus?
Tom's not home.

Help us.
He got up.
It's your key.
I know that story.
He's running.
I'll be there three times.
Please eat something.
Sit down.
Does Tom help Mary?
You're not eating anything.
He can come.
Listen.
Play a pair of pieces together.
Let Tom talk.
Tom 100% right.
I thought in Tom Boston.
It's a station?
Stop Tom.

What do you want?

It's not mine.
I'm going to Kikindo.
Take care of the car.
Who are you?
Don't mind any part of me.
I'm able to swim.
Everyone's tired.
I didn't blame myself.
Three of them have left.
It's so bad when someone's dead.
Tom just keeps his word.
He knows where we are.
I have two brothers.
Don't make me feel at least.
Take us there.
Your bike is better than mine.
I don't like my body.
I'll go to the store every morning.

Do you understand what he says?
I don't understand.
Just close the door when the bus is down.
It's a secret to me.
I have a good French dictionary.
Please start the meter.
What the fuck?
I don't have to give a statement.
Stop here.
Trust Tom.
Tom's talking.
Are you coming in?
I don't want to eat anything now.
I'm still your friend.
Tom can't get up with us.
It's a hospital.
Take the doctor's advice.
What a wonderful day!
The woman's looking for the pistol.
Do you know what he said?
I'm shouting.
I want to ask Tom something.
I made the deal.
You have to see the passport.
You don't have your daughter and baby.
I kept the door open.
Where's the door in the museum?
There's no one there.
I came back.
I think Tom's older brother.
Tom's going to sing.
They're coming to us.
Don't sleep.
My father is a teacher.
Ask me again.
I'll go back to Agami in Australia.
There's a limit to everything.
Even Tom was affected.
We both know it's a lie.
Answer me.
Do you have any money?
Don't you want to eat now?
The research is unfair.
I can't live that way.
I'll go.
The Americans call the flag.
Try more.
The sun rises east and rises west.

Tell me what you need.
Eat it!

How old is he?
Wait.
I'll be back in a month.
It's my brother.
I'm your friend, right?
Call on the hospital.
I'm awake.
Tom was crying last night.
He's killing me!
I was an idiot.
It's about six o'clock.
I met a man named Tom.
I'll kiss Tom.
We're worried.
How much should this be?
My name is Tom.
You'll be right on the next floor.
I want time.
I like both of you.
It's very low.
Do you have a house empty?
Tom tried to keep his mouth up.
He's asking what it can do.
Go inside.
Don't ask.

Come here.
I'll wake me up six hours.
You deserve this prize.

Stop here.
Wait there.
Many say Tom is the best game in our group.
Someone's worried.
I forgot her name.
Tom keeps his word.

How precious is it?
He's a doctor.
Is it a direct route?
Don't fight.
I'll show you some green dress.
Everyone shouted.
Who is he?
I'm pregnant.
Translation this word in English.
Your answer is correct.
I want to confirm my ticket.
Is that enough?
I want to cry.

How will I get out of here?
Good night.
Can you keep my bill?
I'll call you before.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Tom agreed to keep a doctor.
Nice to see you again.
It's the Tom Scooter.
I'm just feeling so lonely.
It was entirely wrong for Tom.

Don't talk.
What's this?
I'm so tired.
There's a whale there.
How do you write your letter?
You're my daughter.
He got up.
How long do we have to get out of here?
How is this word to be spoken?
Do you have any idea of evolution?
I'm not your enemy.
Tom saw it.
I got my hat in the car.
We have to try.
Cobobos has discovered America.
I feel good.
Help!
I got away from me.
Welcome to Wikipedia.
I don't know what you want to say.
Tom's gone.
It'll be rain tomorrow in the morning.
He told me he would be Venis.
Tom's dead.
Looking at him in the factory.
He tried.
That's not a mistake.
You can stay here as long as you want.
Everyone says love is dark.
Take your doctor.
Who's gonna run?
Are you a doctor?
He told me he would leave Venis.
Their parents tried to keep them away.
I'll be late.
Good morning!
Help!
I like that.
Is this your book?
I won't lie.
Answer my question.
Everyone saw it.
What will you do tomorrow?
Just stay here.
Will you stand there all day?

I'll be back in half an hour.
I've got a friend.
Tom was trying to stay away from Mary.
Is there a flight in New York?

Are they yours?
He's standing right now.
Wait.
I'm ready.

Let him go.
Stay there.

It's both cute together.
No gas.
What's the news?
That's my line!

Can you get a hotel?
Can I see your passport?
How bad now?
I want to buy an investment.
You go ahead.
The summer is over.
I'm sorry, but it's not possible.
Get out of here!
How long have you been to watch French?
Are you sick?
This is my friend Rakel, we've been reading at high school together.
I can keep English.
I understand your language.
Yes, indeed!
I don't think Tom likes you.
Is your hand clear?
The house was broken by the snakes.
We've been hit by the cats.

I'm not coming.
My father's too long.
I lost my key.
On the other hand, I'm at a hotel.
Where do you want to go?
My book seemed easy.
Tom went to post office to send a letter.
Do you understand now?
Can you take me to this address?
I was surprised.
He doesn't eat anything except that fruit.
Can I take a picture?
My cell is stolen.
You don't want to talk about this.
Bring it to me.
The train stopped at all stations.

We talked about things.
Don't you want to eat now?
How old are the big guys?
Call Tom.
Do you know how this word is to be spoken?
It's my sister, Mary.
I'm tired of it.
Tom's big eyes.
I didn't want it to happen.
You're my daughter.
How old is this painting?
Don't worry about yourself.
Welcome.
Tom tried.
Tom tried to keep his face up.
Where are the pictures?
What'll Tom come with?

The guards are laughing.
Tom Lajko.
There's three buttons.
I didn't get any shoes I like.
I'm going to take the train at 11:00.
Tom hit the door, but no one came out.
He can say Japanese.
I let you try to surprise you.
It's very hard to work with Tom because he never agreed that he made the mistake.
Tell me!
It's oil.
You understand?
Tom is now in heaven.
Move!
We're lost.
You got your car?
Stop Tom.
Tom's here.
Who wrote the letter?
I want to hear who win.
I like that.
How much?
Don't let me go.
It's not good news.
Have you ever been in Europe?
You're done with that?
Do you think I'm sitting next to you?
The boss has come.
He gave me.
I'll ask you again.
Everyone agreed.
Look back.

I'll run.
Everyone's dead.
That's what I'm doing.
Take care of yourself.
Kill Tom.
I asked Tom where he was.
Leave Tom.
He's got two girls.
That's mine.
Looks like you're sick.
I'll never say that.
There was a lot of trouble on the road.
I can tell Chinese, but I can't write.
So let's go home?
What happened?
It's not clean.
I want to be more free.
I'm not surprised.
They're inside.
I cried.
I still didn't have the file.
Did you call?
I'm back.
I'm ready to go.
Why are you staring?
Why are you crying?
Tom started shouting.
Can you wait for a minute?
We're waiting for them.
Tom's injured.
I've been out of my name, how much more do I need to reach the next post?
I'm fine.
Come out.
What's your name?
Everyone says this old house is broken.
That's my brother.
I'm still your friend.
I have three options.
I'll cut you first.
They look like American.
"Hurry and do not move." "Come on."
I forgot his name.
Are you all made?

Is that your car?
Call Tom.
What were you inside?
The bus station is five minutes from here.
How much did you eat?
I understand.
Got it!
I don't know what he wants to say.
You understand?
Tom's not smart as Mary thinks.
Your book is on the desktop.

Good night!
Go inside.
Keep watch at the door.
I'm doctor.
He's not yet coming.

Go on.
I'll take a look.
Here's your key.
He's got to go to the party.
The magic is now closed.
My hand's hurt.
Everyone saw it.
Good luck and no more.
He's sleeping like children.
Who are they?
What do you understand?
Would you be able to speak more slowly?
It's still mine.
Don't come.
Tom, you can't get it from it.
Tom's bad.
You can choose what you want.
Tom helped me.
Let him go.
Let's wait here.
What time did you take for the satellite bus port?
Stay at home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if it's time to do it.
Tom's talking about him.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some green.
Tom's gone.
You go before.
We've been eating dinner all night.
It's gonna start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What's that down there?
The football game.
The sky is clear.
Nasssir!
I really appreciate your generosity.
He told me he was going to Veniss.
What's your phone number?
He's walking.
What does this mark mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Stay here.
Am I too late?
Leave her.
I can't say the right thing.
A media of language Hollo communication.
Tom knows that.
I never listen to Tom.
What time did the next train take for Tokyo?
Tom's getting a big risk.
Are they?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to go to the beach.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He didn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
You have to tell me how much I want to say.
The snow reflects the great white king.
Come out.
They shouted.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for the spring.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's blackmailed.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my dog the morning and the morning.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please correct my high level.
Do what he says.
You're so tired to see.
Tom started shouting.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today is June 18th and today's birthday.
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We have to do this with our empty Tom, right?
Can you find these pictures in this issue?
I'm going to Oska Station.
I don't think Tom's responsible for it.
Someone's a calculus.
I went to bed.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's get them a little bit.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used.
I got it.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come on to me.
I'm worried.
I don't do it properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this the Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could die.
Are you sure?
We have to go now.
He's in the school.
I didn't want to see Tom.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
It's easy to get his head down.
Wherever his dog is behind him.
Who's this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
I'm my leader to build old bomb.
I like that.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus be left?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bicycle?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play a very nice glass.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped shouting.
How old was Tom?
Come on, come on!
Stop touching it.
Was Tom there?
I've been bleeding this afternoon.
My back is still suffering.
Where's Tom gone?
They look like American.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I've accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a good car.
I'll be together.
You need your friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his name was Jackson.
You know Tom's been more than me for a long time.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
I haven't come yet.
Tom's not yet here.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom just keeps his word.
It's something to eat.
Is there someone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where am I going from?
I'm going to shock.
Can he speak French?
I can't do that.
We love our country.
Is that the doctor?
And a little bit?
And one day it's gone.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friends.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Call me tomorrow.
That's mine.
Where will I ask my wallet?
I do whatever we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
The book is not the native language for all students who are not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who do you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I was.
No one's a matter of concern.
Are you here?
The rest are laughing.
How long will you stay?
Did you see the man in this picture?
I've lost my stuff.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake up Tom.
My son's got money.
The sky looks like snow can begin tonight.
How much is it worth?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want to eat the tea.
Those who live in the streets should not be burned.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his shirt back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'll eat a shower.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided into a river and west.
Look at yourself.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to sleep.
You got a car?
Tom's playing gas.
You're thinking about something now?
He's running.
Can you keep track of Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
It's hurting.
How much do these albinisms do?
How much extra do you pay?
Everyone liked Tom.
What's happening here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's do it a little bit.
Eat what you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken up?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't take my right leg.
I've got a kiss.
How old are you?
Can I ask a question?
What is that?
Here's your key.
We've seen more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What is that?
He's drinking.
I like the kung fu.
You didn't understand.
My mom's hurt.
Sit at the table.
He's little from me.
What's your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book is only available in French.
Tell me.
I'll take her.
Can I pay credit with the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson's house.
He's got a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone's on the move.
Do you have any choice for students?
I'll eat nodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask how they're doing, ask what they do.
Are you coming in?
I'm saying.
We like the football game.
What are you eating?
Good evening.
He's eating empty fruit.
I want to make new clothes for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Rejoice.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll go through the winter if it's raining tomorrow.
My right arm's hurting me.
My father was busy.
Ready to go.
I couldn't get the train at 7:00.
She had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk about it.
Do you have a pen?
The class doesn't start before eight.
You've spent a lot of time in that way?
What does that word mean?
How much am I gonna get?
Can you say English?
They're wrong what they did.
My son is too long from me.
Tom's parents were Gück.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
See her in the factory.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was mad.
How much is it worth?
You can eat whatever you want.
Let's go.
I've been a little dark.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Make sure.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're skinning.
You're shouting.
I don't think it's raining tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
It's good for me to see you.
He's grown in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Trojan was killed.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's father is a star.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now it's a time.
I never forget.
Where's the door on the UA11?
I'm crying.
Why are you staring?
Tom wants his skin back.
How much time do you go to sleep?
The country has made a deal between them.
I speak with Tom in an empty French language.
Tom hit his eyes.
Can you take this for a while?
Tom is now the guard.
What did you forget?
I don't really want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's walking.
He's not yet coming.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my balance.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has issued an order.
Leave the city!
Go to Titish.
He's eating.
How old was that church?
Let's go!
I can say Japanese.
Did you see her out?
How much did you leave for the hotel bus port?
Don't fight.
That's my poison.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got my nose.
We walked on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom was shouting.
Tom's very low.
Eat what you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctor.
The plane's in the right time.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the viewers were in business.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of trouble.
Tom won a lot.
He knows where we are.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's dead.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay outside.
My mother can't run well.
They're on the move.
The research was successful.
I think Thomas's only chance to have a little chance to keep him in touch.
Boston is a big city.
I'm also 17.
Here's your key.
Let's go.
Eat your lunch.
Both of us are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is that your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the Faldeny?
Tom's injured.
Go back to the top pane.
Is Tom still angry with me?
Tom's gone.
We're waiting for you.
I'm not sure.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
Let me know if I do something.
We tried.
Tom left the October.
The market is near the doctor.
Good day!
I'll be late.
What does this mark mean?
Tom cut his head off.
Are we ready?
I like to have Tom Blue Arrests.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Are you going to go to buy with me?
Come on.
They're there.
I'll keep alert.
Everyone's okay.
Don't let me go.
Who was it?
I'm Lajko.
When I told you that Mary left the city, I was really surprised to see Tom.
I heard shouting.
When was your plane time?
You don't want to talk about this.
My book seemed interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I've been in an eight-time.
Please fire the light.
Tom's injured.
I'm still your friends.
I had more than two hours to translate a few pages.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is it the small road to the station?
Tom was trying to kill Mary.
Where did you recognize her?
It's impossible!
When the train reached Yokohama at the time?
What's wrong now?
The correct words will not correct them, and you can make more regular translation.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen to me, is this train going to the Washington Square?
We're worthless.
There's EC's in this house.
Did you follow the whole thing?
Tom Barton went.
Clean it up.
Don't open it.
Tom looked at him.
Maybe the snow can take away.
I'm not proud of him.
Is there someone there?
I'm wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's crying.
It's just blood.
Are you going to catch the fish with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in the twenty minutes.
One minute.
Tom's injured.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
Don't look!
As soon as possible, finish it.
Use it.
When the train reached Yokohama at the time?
I don't know that too.
I got up seven times this morning.
I'm home.
Come on.
Good day!
I got in.
Me too.
I'm not very busy.
It's wonderful.
Do it again!
Tom started to fly.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll be close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm hurt.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking what I'll give you on the birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you crying?
Stay right there.
Eat what you like.
We were playing the party.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy the ticket?
I've finished my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started shouting.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't get in.
We're lost.
Tom's shouting.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm just looking at it, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do you think I've seen?
Tom's not happy here.
It's getting mad.
I don't like eating coffee.
Talk more fast.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
We don't beat him what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can't ever play a better game.
We're Lajko.
The bill will be signed today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have Wayne.
Why did Tom cry?
