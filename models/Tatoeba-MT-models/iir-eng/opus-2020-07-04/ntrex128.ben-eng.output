The whole country of Bolivia, near a blood source, is still the memory of Harano Tauo — it's also clear to travel to the Pacific Ocean for another time.
These hopes may be the highest in a few decades, because Bolivia has been waiting for an international court to be held on October 1 after a discussion of five years.

John Edward: need the language skills for the world
The independent schools of Scotland have set up a record of the unique quality record, and it has kept the results of more recent tests that are just art, art, art, music, and other community efforts in the efforts of other communities.
With more than 33,000 students across Scotland, the School for Schools (SSIS), the School for Schools for Education (SSIS) is the highest level of education and the best level of education.
In addition to high school schools for their students more and higher education, their chosen careers and world citizens are required to prepare for their position as citizens.
As a educational field, which can be developed and applied, we've been keeping up the modern language in schools as popular and popular.
Nellson Mandela said: "If you speak with someone in a language that he understands, it's his head.
If you speak with her in your own language, she's hearty."
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with other countries, we can only rely on English.
From the results of this year's recent experiment, we can see that languages have the highest rate in Leg tables, with the highest rate in the independent school.
A total of 68 percent of students in foreign language students have received a high percentage of high speed.
From the age of 74 members of the SS, 72 percent of students in the United States have received high grades of high school when 72 percent of German studies were conducted, 69 percent of those students and Spanish studies have also reached 63 percent.
This proves that the independent schools of Scotland support foreign schools as a heavy task that will be needed for children and adults in the future.
Now, as the language is popular, the readings of the Theocratic Schools, and other places of the STV, technology, technology, and so on.
In a conference on YouTube's Committee for Embassy and Sculsi in 2014, the directors have demanded 17 percent of their language skills.
So, more than that, young people have become vulnerable to language skills to prepare for their future careers.
These skills need the language that is needed for more possible activities around the world.
Anyone who has chosen the choice of Korean, if they learn the second language, will have their real benefits in the future.
It is not easy to be able to communicate directly with foreign people before it meets a popular person.
In 2013 more than 400,000 adults in Ukraine were asked: 75 percent could not speak well in a foreign language, and only 10 percent of French languages were spoken, 15 percent of them.
This is why it is important for children today to be involved in language education.
More languages, particularly developing economics, will give the children a better opportunity to search for economics.
In Scotland, each school school will be different in their native languages.
Several schools will take note of modern modern technology, while others will be taught languages that are most important to Ukraine, such as the Manandine or Japan.
Whether your children's interest in you or not, there will always be a lot of languages to select in the independent schools, including the experts.
Scottish independent schools have been encouraged to provide a education environment that will prepare children and make them with necessary skills to succeed in the future.
It cannot deny it at this moment that language plays an important role in the future, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be viewed as the “right of international communication.”
The independent schools will provide this choice for young Scotland’s young people.
You must be one.
John Edward, director of the Scanddon School of Independent School

North Korea says "No way" will not be alone without faith.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Shenar has told the United States that the recent ban on the United States has increased and there is no chance to release their nuclear weapons in the national situation.
Ryang Hoh, the annual Global Voices General Assembly said that the North Korea has been blocked last year, broken by nuclear experiments, and have taken steps to reduce nuclear technology and nuclear weapons"
"In the United States, we haven't seen any kind of reaction in the United States."
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security and there is no way for us to be completely neutral in this national situation."
Although Ryling's "instruence" method of communication with the North Korea's "interrupted" accused of being rewarded for slow action in North Korea, his speech was significant because he gave it as a means of disgruntling, as though he did not know it.
The first meeting between the US president and the leader of the North Korea in June 12 was mentioned by Kim Zongu and Doondan Trent, when Kaum ordered the "sirity" to work on the "sibilities of the Indian subcontinent" and when the captain of the North Korea received a letter.

Harved's students are doing a lot of rest.
This year, a new Corffen-Bagan-Bagann university has been sending all his students to sleep for the rise of the night to learn more about the culture of the day.

In a section of a student's room, students will know about coffee, screen, training, and the effects of the effects of the fires and the noise of the light and the importance of sleep.

A map of the Campos with the Intrigued icon, and the participants are moved to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as if your cigarette is decided to eat, even if it has the right to share its effects on health, including 'Ferger City'.
He says that the proud culture of "keep awake in the morning" is still present, he adds, a major problem of sleeping on modern technology and students because of increasing pressure on the students.
In order to be a student of your well-being, you need to have a student's ‘lossions ’ to fight against discouragement, depression, and anxiety, he says, even make the body of a sleeping brain to satisfy their loyalty. "
The 19-year-old Redmond So, professor of psychiatry and physical science, helped make the Cervisso, professor of sex, also took a class of his first year in Harvey, California.
He said that the court had opened his eyes, and he was forced to follow up for a camp-of-Wided Corre.
In the next step, he hopes that the students will ask for a set-up program to complete the program before attending the contest.
Professor Seychelle's appeal that when students have to go to bed and when they are going to sleep, they should take care of an alarming plan and be aware of the impact of the "unscience of light" and the damage that your circuitnian can cause to get down.

Dezt Island disk: Tom Delley has been "inflated" because of sexual immorality.
According to the Australian Daily Daily Daily, he was in a lack of sexuality - but he was motivated to achieve success.
This 24-year-old said he didn't realize he was not like me.
When speaking to the first radio at the first four radio station, Lauren, the first radio 4D Island, he explained that he spoke about the right to give others the rights of others.
He adds that his feelings about the anti-reproduction after his child was born.
This long-time event has taken several months because of the daily immigration of Christian English disease.
At the first event in Ur's first ceremony, Delley said that he felt better than everyone else because "You" was not allowed to be socially accepted by women."
He says: "As far as I can see, that feeling has been real to me that I've been able to win the success and strength."
He said he wanted to prove himself as “a thing” so that everyone could know about his sexuality so that everyone would not be disappointed.
In the Apologize of two bars, the HBBB has become a public preaching campaign and has used his presence to appeal to more countries for recognition of the Commonth Games in Australia.

In June, Robert Re-Blley was born a son named Robert Rack-deley, who said he had changed his “precious view.”
He said, "If I asked me the last year, I would say, 'I'd have to win a gold model' it was my mind.
"Yes, there's something more bigger than the antitype."
Ribei is my anti-terrorist.
His son, Robert, died at the age of 40 when he was 40 years old.
Delley said that his father never acknowledged that he was going to die, and he finally asked that London was confirmed by their tickets - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I never could say, 'You're no longer in the first row," he says.
"As soon as his breath was closed, I took his hand and ran away until he died and died and I didn't admit that he was missing," he said.
The next year, Day Daily won a part of the Apocalypse and the Bronx.

You'll sit in the kitchen on the roof of the office on Saturday.
The U.S. Phil Michaelson will record a record on his 47th radio table, but it would have to be in his form if he didn't want to do the worst things.

Despite the number of drivers in Turkey, this 48 years of age is not appropriate for the Golf National Council, which has often been hit by the long cold blast.
And if the course isn't very bad, Michael, 9th May, British Onsan Champagne, is facing the face of Francesmoli, who has joined the Rikkim team this week with the Rykim flud.
If Americans who have four points at the start of the 12th class, can start a good start, Michaelson's match can be significant.
Furrick showed confidence in him, even though there was nothing to say.

"You should keep yourself in mind that we had our big Lady in the good company; in Brooklyn, where we were living, where we were able to win, and where we were to win, it's shown to him, but on Friday and last Friday, it's shown to him that he's going to be on Friday and last night in July 2013.
History will show me and the team that it won't end yet.
Full of encouragement.
Get in the ground and do the right thing.
The board doesn't end until the point is over.
We have a goal, that's what it's trying to try and see our birds.

Borge adds: "I am happy what our players have done in the hard hole, "I'll never believe in an Arab."
There's a different fight tomorrow.
It's a different thing.

The new war in Germany was stopped again.
The local news news news reported that the German National Nwazz was launched in 2014 to change the war of the former cold-Jugue war, but not for at least one year, because of the injustice system and the use of stimulation.
In addition to the military Face, the New bet said to be the first ship of the New World-Wormberg-Servatory to start the "Rinland-haz" first in 2011.
The ship was to be connected to the boat in 2014, but the current project was problem because of the ongoing problem of Delververity.
In 2007, the ship that took four bendnden-Wormborg-Serving ships will take place.
It's known that they're in the hands of powerful cameras, anti-Afried and anti-Eterrorist and anti-Sharidder technology, such as Reddder, Infrastructor, and the Acracy.
Other important features include a long period of period of waiting — the new free flows can be taken for the most two years of the country’s history.

This was the first time a ship sent back to Shippe after a ship's flight from Delhi.
The causes of the following are very small, but German media has a number of important “software and hardware errors” that will destroy the ship in the war.
The photos of software are especially important, because the ships of Bendan-Wormberg will be guided by a number of more than 120 November, which are half the members of the FGS members of the former Britain class.
Also, it was seen that the ship's lower weight would reduce the activity of its operation and make the road to the future of the boat.
This 7000 tons of "Relland - Roland" is thought to be double than the same type of ship used during World War II.
The whole project has also been a problem with the error hardware, the training, and training of the crew.
The first level of 2.2 billion pounds from the pedestrian plane has reached 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars).
This warning has become more important in the recent issues of the German boat.

The officer said that the problem was solved with time, because the former ships had been canceled had no stable ship.
He expressed regret that there was no boat on the Bodden-Worten-Wormberg-Shahaz to join the boat.
