Why do we think that it is hard for him to serve him?
Why did I bring him up for me?
Why do you love me so much?
Why do you want me to go and see my face?
Why do you torment me, unless you ask for me?

It is good for you to learn the word through reading of the book of life.
You always have the keys.
You're always sitting up.

San Francisco will come to see your face.
