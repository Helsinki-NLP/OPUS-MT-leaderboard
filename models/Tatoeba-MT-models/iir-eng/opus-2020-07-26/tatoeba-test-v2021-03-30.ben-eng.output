I don't know if it's time to do it.
Tom keeps his word.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some aluk.
Tom's gone.
You go ahead.
We've all eaten dinner.
It's gonna start with Esculul tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What's that down?
The football game.
The sky is clear.
Nasssir!
I'm really trying to earn your generosity.
He told me he was going to Venis.
What's your phone number?
He's walking.
What does this mark mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Am I too late?
Leave her.
I can't say exactly.
Language is a channel of communication.
Tom knows that.
I never listen to Tom.
How long did the next train take off for Tokyo?
Tom's getting a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to run away.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
You have to tell me how much I want to say.
The snow reflects the so-called Rushmi.
Come out.
They shouted.
I was running home.
We built a pancake for the first time.
You don't have a bicycle?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's gone.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my dog a rest morning and morning food.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please keep my office clean.
Do what he says.
It's so tired to see you.
Tom started shouting.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today is June 18 and today's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to let Tom do this for us, right?
Can these be found in an emergency?
I'm going to Oska station.
I don't think Tom's responsible for it.
Someone's gone.
I went to bed.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's take a look.
Tom was busy with work.
I am not proud of the way I used.
I'm worried.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come on to me.
I'm worried.
My hand is not working.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is that Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could die.
Are you sure?
We have to go now.
He's gonna take care of the reading.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's easily cut his head off.
Wherever he goes, his dog is behind him.
Who's this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my leader to build an old bottle.
I like that.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus be left?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bicycle?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play a very good golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped shouting.
How old is Tom?
Come on, come on!
Shut up.
Was Tom there?
I've shed blood this afternoon.
My back is still hurt.
Where's Tom gone?
They look like American.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I was in the hospital.
I accepted her invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be together.
You need your friend.
Forget about Tom.
I thought Tom said his lead was Jackson.
You know Tom's been more than I've ever known.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My bags haven't reached yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom just keeps his word.
It's something to eat.
Is there someone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where will I get the Stamp from?
I'm going to sleep.
Can he speak French?
Tom could not do that.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
And a little bit?
And one day it's gone.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friends.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me this time.
It's still mine.
Where would I ask my client?
We do whatever we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is not a native language for students who are not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who will you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I wanted.
No one's illegal.
Are you here?
The rest are laughing.
How long are you sleeping?
Did you see the man in this picture?
I lost my stuff.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom up.
My son's getting business.
The sky looks like snow can begin tonight.
How much is it worth?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want to be empty.
Those who live in the mud should not be drawn to the rocks.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his shadow back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided into a river and west.
Look at yourself.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to sleep.
You got a car?
Tom's playing the trigger.
You don't have any idea what you're doing right now?
He's lying right now.
Can you keep watch on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
It's gonna hurt me.
How much do these albinisms do?
How much should I pay for extra drinks?
Everyone liked Tom.
What's happening here?
Take your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's take a moment.
Eat whatever you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't take my right foot.
I've had a chicken.
How old are you?
Can I ask a question?
What is that?
Take your key.
We've seen more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What is that?
He's eating.
Krong likes Gaza.
You didn't understand.
My mom's hurt.
Sit at the table.
He's from me.
What's your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book is only available in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay credit with the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson's house.
He was wearing a black hat.
Anything else?
All of them are alert.
Do you have any choice for students?
I'll eat nodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask how they are, ask what they do.
Will you come inside?
I'm telling you.
We like the football game.
Will you eat?
Good evening.
He ate empty fruit.
I want to make new arrangements for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Have fun.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'm going to go through the winter, even if it's rain.
My right shoulder is hurting me.
My father was busy.
They're all ready to go.
I couldn't get that train at 7:00.
She had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a pen?
The class doesn't start before eight o'clock.
Do you have time for that?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
They're wrong what they did.
My son is too long from me.
Tom had parents too.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
Looks at him in the factory.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let's go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Put it in.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're skinny.
You're shouting.
I don't think tomorrow will rain.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like the light.
He's grown in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Trojan was killed.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's father is a superhero.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now it's a time.
I never forget.
Where's the door door on the UA11?
I'm crying.
Why are you staring?
Tom wants his skin back.
How long do you go to sleep?
The country has made a deal between themselves.
I speak with Tom in an empty French language.
Tom hit his eyes.
Can you take this for a couple of guts?
Tom is now the lord.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's walking.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's producing fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my balance.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has issued an order.
Leave the city!
Go to Tisish.
He's getting it.
How old was that church?
Let's go!
It's Japanese.
Did you see her leaving?
How much did you leave for the Seattle bus port?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need any more.
I've got Teeth.
We walked on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom called.
Tom's very low.
Eat what you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctor.
The plane's at the right time.
I don't know what you want to say.
Most of the viewers were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got enough of it.
Tom won a lot.
He knows where we are.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom went missing.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay outside.
My mother can cook well.
They're awake.
The research was successful.
I think that Tom's gold is too short to be kept with him.
Boston is a big city.
I'm also 17.
Here's your key.
Let's go.
Eat your milk.
Both of us are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flowers?
Tom's injured.
Go back to the tape.
Is Tom still angry with me?
Tom's gone.
We're waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
Tell me if I do something.
We tried.
Tom left October.
The market is on the side of the doctor.
Good-bye Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this mark?
Tom broke his head.
Are we ready?
I like to have Tom Blue Arrests.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Are you going to go to buy with me?
Come on.
They're there.
I'll bite.
Everyone's clean.
Don't let me hurt you.
Who was it?
I'm Lujuk.
When I said that Mary left the city, Tom was really surprised to see her.
I heard a scream.
How long did your plane take?
You don't want to talk about this.
My book seemed interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I've been up for 8 years today.
Please fire the light.
Tom is injured.
I'm still your friend.
I had more than two hours to translate some pages into English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is it a small road to the station?
Tom was trying to kill Mary.
Where do you recognize her?
It's impossible!
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
What the hell is that?
The correct words will not correct the correct ones, and instead of making more regular translations.
Your shoes are here.
Are you all ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen to me, does this train take long to Washington Square?
We're worthless.
There's ECs in this house.
Did you follow the whole thing?
Tom was playing.
Just keep it clear.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
It's probably the snow.
I'm not proud of him.
Is there someone there?
I'm wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Are you going to catch the fish with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
One minute.
Tom was injured.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
Don't look!
As soon as possible, finish it.
Use it.
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that too.
It's been seven times this morning.
I'm home.
Keep moving.
Good day!
I got in.
Me too.
I'm not very busy.
It's so beautiful.
Do it again!
Tom started to fly.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My feet are hurting.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking what I'll give you on the birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat your food you like.
We played the party.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy the tickets?
I've done my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started shouting.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't get in.
We're lost.
Tom's breathing.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We're waiting for them.
How old do you think you've seen me?
Tom's not happy here.
It was angry.
I don't like eating coffee.
Talk to me more.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
We don't bite him if he doesn't do it.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can never play a better game.
We're Lujuk.
The bill will be released today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have Wayne.
Why did Tom cry?
