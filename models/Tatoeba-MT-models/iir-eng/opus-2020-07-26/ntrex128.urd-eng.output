He said: "If you speak a man in a language that you understand, he's going to be in his head."
If you talk to a person in his tongue, he's in the heart.
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English to establish relationships and trusts from other countries.
With the results of the recent tests of this year, we can see that in independent schools, languages are above the top of Lingbes.

Under the scant London, every school is reading different languages.
Most schools focus on new languages, while others read languages that have been the most important idea for Britain by 2020, such as Myanmar or Japan.
Any taste of your child's child, free schools will always be available in many languages, and a well-known professor in this field will be a professor.
The school is determined to provide education environments that help children to succeed in the future.
The global business environment at this time can not deny that language is the most important thing for the future of the country, so it should be taught.

Once again, the new warship in Germany was reorganized.
In 2014, the New French Ocean had to be cut off to take control of the coast of the German Ocean, but it would not have been less than a year later, according to local Madrid, the reason is not to be ignored.
The Daily Zeiti newspaper told about a military revolution that the first flight of the new band-weet-Worborg class was to be held to its first flight to the "Surenenland Landfs" to your first year in 2009.
This ship would have to be included in the ocean in 2014, but later the problems of Delhi have destroyed the former revolution.
