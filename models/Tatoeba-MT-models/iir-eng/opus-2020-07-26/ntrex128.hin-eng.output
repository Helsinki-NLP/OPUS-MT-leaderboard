No, no, I'm waiting for something that became very bad.
Work is no longer a body church.
For those who speak what is in their hearts, this is not to be blamed.
It was a surprise to me when my public party had ordered me to choose.
Finally, I'm the newest among those who've lost a lot of dignity - we can't say all of our hearts.
My son-in-law was here with Jean Ren, because he too had a voice to be heard for communication.
In my case, Seser Musssir accused me of being in conflict with Jeremy Corbon.
The importance of the Immoral policy, the national security, was similar to that of Wang Yang Yang in Europe, which was opposed to the gymnasium leaders.
Thank you for the Nottemporium Easter Easter meeting, which was said to Friday, "We want to include all the things in the meeting and it's useful to do it."
During my eight years as a local guard MP, I saw most of the way out there was a frydy match.
Sadly, there are many meetings today, or promises that the politics of the "superior and poor people" are really forgotten here.
It is clearly clear that if the views are different in the Lager Party, they are not built up and are decided for every thought to determine whether it is proper for the party leader.
Before becoming a leader of Jeremy’s leader, those I had previously thought of as my political beliefs, they hoped I would turn back from my words and work on the positions that I could never agree with — whether it was a national security or not.
Whenever I raise a voice for the public - and it doesn't really matter what I said -- to see bad words on Sosal Media, to say, "The politics of Sterer's politics is condemned, and I'm told I'm not worthy of the post party."
Besides, he's not just my experience.
For I know that I am more like some of my associates, because my comments are connected to politics.
I know how to work out the ways of the business, and I am dedicated to associates who always cope with sex or sexual abuse, but don't turn behind the voice.
There are many negative aspects in today's political era, one of which is how to make the standards of harmful behavior normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbon claimed that the culture of the ethnicity of the Liberty party is important.
The fact is that we are no longer the body of the body of the faith, and the changes in any approach to "Faith" or the system's system of communication are very low.
In the past two years, a number of people gave me advice and urged me not to keep silent. And then I will be accepted."
But I didn't come into politics for it.
32 years ago when I was connected to a school team, I was forced to resist the teacher's government, was told to leave the school's principal class completely, I wanted to give the people the best public public services they need, whether they were the local or the government.
I never hid any politics in my last election.
There's no one in the Nutumum East who has no doubt doubts my moral position and I'm going to have no territory to take.
All those who have encouraged the offer of Friday should tell me that when the country is moving toward the breakthrough of the country's homes, business and our public services, I don't understand my time and energy to waste my energy on Laber Party.
But in fact, I have a message that is not for the NToma Mom, it's for my supporters whether they're in Liberia or not: I'm proud that I'm serving you, and I promise that I can do nothing of any kind of shame or political act that I can do in my work.

Air 38 - 17 matches: Go to the nearest layer
The two efforts spent over a period of time can affect the final outcomes, but there is no doubt that the U.S. president of the Irrawaddy of the Air Tents had the right to win in this fine art match.
Now they're only the top in the tenes of the unintended sideboard table.
Finally, they were better able to find the best opportunity they could find, which led them to raise the family team, and gave the company a chance to be happy with Peter Irrawaddy.
He said, "We're all our game testing and we're still tired."
Roben Cristi of Melorz said: "It's the credit to the Air, which is as much as possible."
The attempt of Grant Anderson was made to appear before Ayer on 14 minutes in front of the U.S. but was given to Rothland's player Rouses, who had the chance to make a move, and Zynn made a very difficult attempt.
With the help of the Pentateme, Calimo grew up, shot, and then tried to pull me together from 17-5 to 5-5 at the time of the break.
But the mailos did better in Hoff and changed the attempt of Patrick Anderson to go into the ball, which would reduce five points of lei.
After that, Rudy Nat became a serious wound that caused him to stop the game for a long time, and Irar tried to further the game, after the game was started, to change Claymo.
At that time, the officer of Ire's team had a black card, and the rest of the game ended with a lot of pressure.
However, the host team remained behind the team and when Stewane got the card from the pentline line-out because he had met the clocom of Bill Boll, then Maxerson broke the Air off.
After completing the five attempts to collect David Armstrong's box and deliver five of the home bicycles, Claire changed it into a bullet, as they could at the beginning of the game.
The game's guards are still looking for new workers in the restaurant.
The game's Star Ford Carin is still looking for a road to the hospital, some time ago discovered that they were selected for a license to receive a license company.

'We have our right to the sea': the ground-based Bolivia expects the way to open the way for Cortis to return to the state Pacific.
The military-Nivak is flying on a huge scale at Pasa's National Heidter.
The Osni-Bu flag is being invaded on government buildings.
There is a dance of Nasana Bes: "We have our right over the sea."
It's our DDT to get it again."
In the 19th century, the Titanic, who hit China in the violent conflict for the land, still is still eager to find his land - once again to find his identity in the Pacific Ocean.
Now they hope they can get back to the land of their speech in the past five years, since it is waiting for 1 October to come to the court's judgment.
“The desire for unity and peace in Bolivia is a positive view of the people here, and the hope of people here is a positive view of the people here.”
Many of Bolivia’s people will see the biggest decisions on the largest screen on the country, and they expect that the decision that will be issued by the Court of Heager - which has been issued for decades - which has been forced to return to the land of the country to talk about it.
The best president of Bolivia, Evo Morlas - who are facing the strike-in-law of the following year - has also won a positive victory in the movement of the rest of the country.
Last August he said, "We are very close to get back to the Pacific ocean."
However, some scholars believe that the court's decision will not be in harmony with the law - and if decision comes into effect, it will have to be quite certain.
In the Netherlands, the UN Union has no right to establish the country, and he has decided that it will not be established.
In the International Court, Chile’s expert Pasie Zret said that the decision of ICEG is coming after six months after the last statement, which shows that the case was "not "salty".
Moreover, different from the circumstances of the Bolivian state, it appears that it could come back to the old state for four years.
“The idea of reaching the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia.”
They suggested that Morlas's vulnerabilities have ended with the culprit of Chilli.
Speech and Chelyi will continue to communicate on certain issues, but this time it will be difficult to talk again after decision is made.
Since 1962 the ambassadors of the two countries have not been in one country.
Former president Adedo Rodriguez Veltzsz, former president of the country in Hague, denied that the Court’s decision was unusually slow.
He said that Monday would have the opportunity for Bolivia to open the way of new relations with Chile" and that would have been the opportunity to "get rid of the 139-year-old disputes on Monday."
Calazil has acknowledged that Morlas - who is still one of the most famousst in Latin America — was fighting the sea problem.
He said, "Bolivia will never go back to the Pacific to her authority."
"Feasa has the opportunity to know what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea said that nuclear experiments will not be stopped until they trust in the United States
Rei-e-e-e-Jangh, North Korea's Foreign Minister, said that their nation won't destroy his nuclear bomb until it is trusted.
On Saturday, Rei gave a talk at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He told the United States that he will fulfill the promises during the district convention in Singapore between the leaders of the other countries.
He commented that the American secretary of the state seems to have been trying to re-enter the mission after more than three months of promises in Singapore in Singapore, North Korea.
Rei said that this is a "ppy-Dram" that would give the bans and fires and American suicides to announce the end of the Korean war.
It is a caution from the cooperation of the important emergency campaign that is already running without the announcement of Washington Pingong.
Kim and American president Donal Camp both want to have another top conference.
However, it is totally suspicious that Pongong is serious to end the investigation of the nuclear bomb because they don't want to put the security of the country in danger.
The next month, the couple's plans are planning to go to Pompo Pinging for the second high-summ, the desire for the second-summ.

The best products are designed to save the heat of this year's heat and these designers have sent out to show their beautiful design.
The best hotel built by Valentineo was much bigger than the wings, and he was surrounded with wings like wings that were stuck around the top of the model.
In the other adhesive design of a huge speed, Witland Hett, Witttt, Witttt and penpaps designers - but they are not designed to protect your head from cold.
Tom Brown also showed special design masks - and they can be used only for Holon.
People were amazed at the color-branging masks and saw things like that of the Hubble Lakes.
In a series, Scoob could see all kinds of stuff that included snobel and grass, while ice cream was seen in another operation.
Besides, if you've seen a lot of bigger issues - you're not noticeable.
The poster's estimate that this better function can be reached in the best shops of your neighborhoods.
A lot of big bicycles will meet the same-commba design design, and all people will buy from the two-fundt-frammum-brant-bret-Breth-Breth-Brethroat- from the Emellikscos.
Back to the best effective hitt, the chart was quite beautiful, with the second series posted on Sosil Media - showing the model showing the model of the filming suit on the top of the wall.
It was the best part of the first SS1 of the JS1 in the Paris Federation.
The famous Italian Lactose Emmetz told FEM: "I hope the next summer's weather is large-democracy and the middle of the bag will soon arrive in the bank store - because the designers have so impressed that it would be difficult to ignore the design of the large-gravitational access engine."
John Edward: The language must be the language skills for citizens outside the country
Sketland's private school has kept track of the better education record, and since 2018 it has continued to give the best tests, making personal, music, and other common efforts.
More than 300,000 students in Scotland are connected to the Scottish Council of Indian Schools (SCS) and are trying to serve their students better.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for better education, their chosen careers and their places are bringing benefits to citizens of foreign countries.
As an engineer who can create and apply and apply schools, we see that modern languages continue to be the choice of modern languages in schools as a choice of the subject.
He said: “If you speak to a person in the language that comes to understand him, you're better than him.
And if you speak with him, then it would be very good for him.
When we want to build a relationship and trust the people of other countries, we think we can trust more on English.
At the recent tests of this year, we can see that language is the highest in the range of languages in private schools.
Among them are 68 percent of students who have received the highest grade in foreign languages.
The data gathered by 74 members of the SCIS School can be seen in the data collected by 72 percent of students in Marina, while 72 percent of students in Germany have received 69 percent in German, and 63 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools are working in foreign languages, which are providing necessary skills for children and young people who are in need.
Language is now involved as an alternative subject for private schools and other things.
In 2014, the United Nations Children’s Fund, released by U.S.A., found out that the atheists fought very hard to set up workers on lower positions, 17 percent expected to be limited in language skills.
Therefore, young people have to have more language skills to prepare for their future career.
As a result of the more possible job opportunities of language, these skills are required to work anywhere in the world.
No choice for the career, if people learn another language, such skills will benefit them in the future.
If you are able to talk to the people directly, you will be able to go forward in competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in Britain shared in Yuguvo survey, according to that, 75 percent of those in a foreign language did not find enough to talk much in a foreign language, and only the French was the only subject that was spoken by 15 percent and that is the same language in the next decade.
This has made it necessary for children to learn the language.
In a number of languages, especially in developing countries, children can find a better chance to find the right time to search for employment.
The language taught in every school in Scotland will be different.
There are many schools who will focus on the more classic medieval languages, while other schools will teach languages that are on the side of the 2020 and that are most important for Europeans, for example, to be considered the most important of them in Japanese or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest in learning any language, they will always choose the language in private schools and will also be able to learn the language that is taught by the teacher of this area.
Sketland's private school is dedicated to provide a education that will prepare children for the future and will give them the necessary skills to succeed in the future.
The Global Business Environment can no longer be charged that learning languages in the country is important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should truly be accepted as "international skills".
The choice of young people in Scotland will continue to be given through private schools to select this option, variety and beauty.
I'll take a pint.
The director of the Scottish Council of Intelligence is John Edward of the Schools.

The North Korea said "No way" would be only one side that can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations has continued the bans on their beliefs in the United States, and there is no way to allow the country to focus solely on itself in such circumstances.
Rei Young Ho, said in The Wall Street Journal of the World, the North Korea last year was a number of ways that the North was connected to "the most popular way", such as to stop the test of nuclear bomb and mesiling, and not to continue the projecting of nuclear nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
He said, "Yes, we haven't found any answers in the United States."
"No one will trust our national security without trusting in any way, and there's no way in such situations that we're going to get started by a single protection."
When Rire repeated that the complaints were seen by North Korea are about to be seen by Washington's "renade" view of Washington, which will easily get the benefit of Korea, their statement is completely clear that it could not be left by just one party, since the Pingong has already done so before.
The first time, on June 12, service between the U.S. President and North Korea's president, R. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. N. N. N. K. N. T. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R.

Washington has also opposed the call to eliminate international restrictions on North Korea's northern Korea.
Rii said, "U.S. first forced the pressure to get his purpose so that he could get his purpose and also, he said, "The end of the war has come to an end."
"The ban can fall upon us, the idea is a puppy of people who are ignoring us.
But that's always the ban on our trust and that's going to slow down."
Rei didn't discuss the plans of another top-hand conference between Kim and Tram, he said that the U.S. leader had arranged the beauty of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed the three meeting held between Kim and South Korea during the last five months, and added: “If I have lost vision, the party is South Korea for this problem and the US.
Nevertheless, the talk was quite different from the last year's talk, when he said of the S.N. National Assembly of the Soviet Union that called "Rict Manon" "M. .R. President," after the trip to North Korea with the U.S.R.R.R.R. M. M. Manlandlander.
This year, in the United Nations last year, the town's threat to North Korea was praised for the courage of the arrival of Kim, who was held up to arrest, but said that there is still much work to do and apply until the ban is under ban.
Wednesday, Tram told them that they have no time for it, "If it takes two years or five years, it's not going to be a park."

The MMA's grand beer was awake all night to see 206, but instead they got puppy puppy puppy pizza
Imagine you've been living to see the 206-year-old beer all night, but the main program was lost by seeing the main program.
San Jose's Bill was 13th, including the main card, and was being shown all night at the U.S. channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Gonds and Ryrei MacDonald were preparing to face one another each other, in U.S.A., the audience stopped changing the cup of coffee.
In particular, there were some disappointment after the morning wake up to adversity.
On Twitter, a lecturer described how to switch to the child's carnival as "a kind of disease fun".
When asked about the process, President David Schwartz said, "This material was not suitable for 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to change the program for children."
"Ppa puppy pizza." yes.
President Scott Cocoke, president of the Blatter company, said they are going to work on their schedule to join the U.S. audience in the future.
"When I think about reversive, I think we might find it," he said.
"But there'll be six Sunday mornings and we won't work on it until Sunday, Monday."
But we're working on it.
Let me believe that when this change changed, the sound of a lot of tapes and they weren't all appropriate.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't, it was a government point.
I can promise you that it won't happen the next time.
We'll keep it limited to five degrees rather than six-- as we normally do - and when we tried to make a little more for the protesters, it's a bit worse.
It's a desperate situation."

The Olympic gothropor Tom Delley says he was deeply moved by feelings of self - but it moved him to make success.
24-year-old Daniel didn't realize until she came to the media school.
Before speaking on radio 4 December Island disk, he said he speaks of homosexual rights to give others “medical rights” to others.
He also said he was concerned about losing the Olympic winning when he became a father.
The regular presentation of the show has taken several months since the disease.
In the first program, showing as a social person, Daniel said he was feeling like "Kim" in comparison to everyone, because he was not socially accepted by the boys and girls."
He said: “Even today, they are feeling low in comparison to others, and they have the real things that gave me the strength and strength to succeed.”
He also wanted to prove that he was “saint” so he said not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his work.

"When you're so short of life" - he went to his first in the Olympic at 14 years of age and died three years after his father died in cancer - he said that it was difficult for any of us to experience such experiences as this.
The couple in June became the parents of a son named Robert Ryc-Dedley, who said he had been changed.
"If you had asked me the last year, it would have been all I needed to win the longest position," he said.
"You'll know, there's a lot more than the Olympics.
I'm a Olympic-technic character Robby."
His son, Robert, is like his father, Robert, who died in the late 1940 ’ s after he died of brain cancer.
Delly said that their father didn't accept their father to die and they wanted to know the last time they wanted to know if they had come to London 2012 tickets - because they wanted to sit in front of the line.
He said, “Did I not tell you that you will never be able to harm me, unless you patiently stay with me?”
He said, "I did not recognize [the she-camel] until I had forgotten the fish." [He said], "Then I remained in [a deep sleep] until [the sun was removed."
The next year, Dilly joined the Ottok in 2012 and won the Kakusha rank.

Saturday's reader is out of the out-of-Fram Mitchells
American Philelson will establish record on Sunday when they play their 47th Reided hats, but it will change their form to protect them from being a bad match.
The 2nd-time launch program for record was playing in the double-time program for the 12th, Mikhalson set out from the game for the week's mobile phones and Facebook.
Instead of becoming attractive center, as he is often made up for the United States, five main winners lived amongst those who celebrate their day and worked with hope to improve the quality of their game.
Even on your career's temperature, the 48-year-old player is never going to drive directly, and the 48-year-old player has not been the model for the golf National Center, where people who have not been active will be regularly punished for a long time.
And wherever the course is not so easy, there's a match in the New York City's New Testament, with British Open-Palmpanski, who has played a game with Rikkichi Temple to win all his four meds this week.
If the American player, who start with four points down in the 12 sychelles's match, can be much more important than Michaelson's match.
Ficky trusted his man, not that they could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, my back in my arms and in my arms and say they'll be ready tomorrow," said Frick.
"He's very confident about himself.
He's the hotel of the office and he's back in the past and has contributed to these games and a lot in this week.
I probably didn't think of playing her two matches.
I had more idea, but it worked the way we thought we had to move.
He wants everyone to get out of there."
Mitchellson will pass the record for most of the most playing Red Pop matchs on Sunday.
It can mark the end of the record of Reposer, who never touched the tops of their personal record.
Mitchellson has 18 won, 20th and seven times, although Frick said his presence brings some difference in the team.
"It's funny, it's funny, meeting, ridicule, ridicule, and his presence in the team room," they explained.
"I think young players also had fun to visit them this week, which was interesting to see.
He only gives much to play."
Captain Thomas Bronner, of Europe, knows that a growing number of people may be hungry soon
Thomas Baron, from his experience, knows that in the last day of the last day, there may be a lot of speeding on the average day.
Dan first expressed his first show in Valdira in 1997, where a party in Siwa Balalceris had gained five numbers on the U.S., but with the victory of 141 /11/11 /2, the bus is at low level.
"You remind yourselves that we had a big deal in Valdama; in Brooklyn, where we were, and in Valdira, we just won, we just won the class of 5-3, from 5-3 to and yesterday from the Golfalphal.
So history will show me and all that team has not finished.
You'll make the whole price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all right.
This will not end until you board a board.
We have a target, and it's to try to win this truck and that's where to keep the focus.
I have always said, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we know well that the greatest player in the world is standing on the other side of the world."
Bourne added how their players displayed the hard-floorers: "I'll never get ahead of myself."
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Tomorrow personal displays will be coming forward, and this is a different thing.
When everything's going well, it's nice to go there with the party, but when you go out there personally, your ability is tested as a golf.
This message is the message you have been sent with to show you tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and go and let him do his best.
On the opposite side of Bourneon, the opposite, Jim Frick will be demanding the best display for his players who had done as a partyer, Apology George Smith and Justin Thomas, who received three numbers from four.
Fricks are on both sides of the march of the Great War team in Brooklyn, before they can show "the miracle in Manama" by the Europe "the miracle in Manama", because of having been part of the revolution team in Brooklyn, Frick is on both sides of those last days."
"I remember her every letter," he said in 1999 to ask how Captain Ben Cranssho had managed his fans the last day.
"We've got 12 important matches, but you want to start the fast like you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in wine.
When this speed is all alone, it puts a lot of pressure on their associates.
We have established this in Our presence just as We had created you for a genuine purpose. You know that this is how We show Our miracles to everyone who has knowledge (of the truth).
Thomas has been assigned to try the answer to the answer to the attacks by the Ruri McLai, where Paulie's day, John Romam, John Flatwood, and Ianpole, have been assigned to the top of Europe.
"I've created these groups in this order because I think it's gonna cover all of them," Baron said about his own single choices.

This was the first time when Nyssa returned to the island after a ship had returned from Delhi.
Few people knew about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted several important “software and hardware” that ruined the war on the mission of war.

The officer said this was serious, because the old ships were removed by the use of the old ships, but there was no moving ship available.
He said that there was no one of the fightrs of Banden-Worderberg.

A mother-in-law company created online by a reporter that compares the milk milk milk of the cows to milk.
To mark the production of the first largest mutum of the world, user Elvii has continued a new interesting video-based idea to reveal new parents.
Four real mothers in the grass of the herd dance at a song that some say: "Yes, I'm milk, but you don't see me" and "if you don't look at me, they're not my eyes."
Practise continues: "Paps out, pipes, pouts, iding, Im Feeding Children, pipes, pipes, pipes, i. e. i. e. i. i. i. M. M. M. M. Mal. M. M. Mal. M. M. M. Mal.
In any case, advertising, published on Facebook page, is a cause of online debate.
With 77,000 audiences and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from audiences, many said that it represents the "terrorism" of the district project.
"It's a very bad decision to use gorillas for this product.
It's just as we need them to give them birth, and to give birth to them, but only in the days after they are born they are taken away." One wrote.
Elvaie Brest Post-Ping Report (ElVie/M) is dedus-buzzing inside Eelví/Mr.
Another comment: "Yes, Mom and child are sorry for both of them.
But why not use them for the news of the Berst Pope for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their children?
And another couple said: "Carry is an understatement."
Others saved the news, one of them said that they sang the "saint" song.
"I think it's a very good idea.
I had it too, if I still had to smoke.
I have the experience of being a cow.
It's a little weird, but I saw it just like that.
One wrote that it's a good product."

It's not a promoter's business.
At the end of the video, a group of women told them that they were being cautious about dancing in their browser.
The background behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women wearing tears say they feel like they're a cow.
However, Alvi pipes are secretly hidden, there is no air or taut, and it is directly due to a nurse going into a nurse's browser, allowing women to hold their children and even go outside.
Ana oxgoran, director and ECD in Mother, comments: "The El Pap is a biochemical product, which is the most famous and well-known and highly respected London.
Speaking of women and Derey's songs, we want to bring the tears and challenges to the platform, displaying the feeling of free and related freedom.

Despite being arrested, even when the magazine has no direct change in the cross - there is a measure of change, because of some extent, the harsh shift and policy offered by the Tropist administration has made it difficult to assign children with the objectives.
Traditionally, the majority of the officials had made the journeys without themselves and were afraid to risk their own ability to live in the country by claiming that they would live in the country.
The threat in June was further increased when the United Nations announced that potential authorities and other members of the house would give their focus and share the data with foreign authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albson, a high official of the Congress, and the borders of the state of the country, presented the position of the Congress that the editors have arrested people who were willing to take control of non-violences.
The agency later confirmed that there was no official record of 70 percent of the arrests.

The lawyer or directors said that these matters are taken to the high position such as Trounolol, where the signal that the child is fighting is being ignored because of their size.
He also said that without giving the children enough time to get enough time or to take them to the city without telling them to be emotionally ready, he will add more time to the situation that he has already been fighting with.

"They should soon get back from the land without any condition," they told Ibrahim.
The Mayor insisted that "the war has been almost over in Syria" where more than 36,000,000 have been killed since 2011 and hundreds of thousands were thrown out of their homes.

They replied: 'We have neglected the affair of an international community and human organization'
"They were always political in human affairs."
The United Kingdom and the United Nations warned that there would be no help to rebuild Syria until there was no political compromise between the war and the conflict.
The United Kingdom politicians say that a bonnon set in Russia and Turkey has recently made an opportunity to pressure the political discussion of the last major rebellion in Adelaide.
Russian-to-right dl or agreement also blocked a large attack on the Russian military force in the region, where three million people lived.
However, Malmo said that "the agreement is a clear time" and hope that the military action would take attention to the warriors associated with Al-Akarad who will be given to the soldiers who will be "demand".
The representative of the United Kingdom is soon expected to organize a new conference with the government and members of the State and the WWI member members of the United Kingdom to clean up Syria and choose the way of the election.
The Malman put certain conditions in the committee for the president of Syria, where it says that the actions of the current constitution should be banned to protect the charge of "inculcate the document" and to warn the authorities.
