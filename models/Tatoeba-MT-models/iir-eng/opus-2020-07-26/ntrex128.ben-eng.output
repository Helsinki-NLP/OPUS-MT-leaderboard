John Edward: It's necessary for people to speak language to the world.
The independent schools of Scotland have kept a record of a record of the single-seatical level, and it has continued to increase the results of a more unusual experiment in sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools have tried to organize their students and parents to set the highest level of level, represented by the Scott’s Council of Intelligence (SISS).
Independent schools try to prepare their students for more and higher education, their chosen careers and the world countries as citizens.
As a education field that can be built and applied, we are watching the modern language in schools to be popular and popular.
Nellson Mandela says: "If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, he's in his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people of other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
From the results of this year's latest experiment, we can see that the languages are on the top table with the high level of paper in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students of foreign language students have received the highest speed.
According to a report from the 74 members of the SCIS School, 72 percent of students in Canada have received high speeds, 69 percent of German study studies, and 63 percent of Spanish studies.
This proves that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as well as foreign languages that will be needed for children and young people in the future.
Now, the language has been set up as the language of the individual schools, as well as other ESTM topics (such as science, technology, technology, and mathematics).
In a conference on YouTube for the Embassy and Celsi in 2014, the directors have charged 17 percent of their language activity.
So more than that, young people have become involved in preparing language skills for their future careers.
These skills are needed for more possible work opportunities around the world.
Anyone whose choice is Korean, if they learn another language, will have their real benefits in the future.
A person who can be able to communicate directly with foreign people has always put a more common person before competitioning.
In 2013, more than 400,000 adults met in Ukraine were not able to speak well in a foreign language, and only 10 percent of the French languages were the only language, 15 percent.
This is why it is important for children today to be organized for language education.
A lot of languages, especially developing economy, will give children a better chance of finding the economy.
In Scotland, every school will be divided into their educational languages.
Several schools will be impressed by modern technology, on the other hand, while focusing on the 2020s, others will learn the language that is most important for Europe, such as Canada or Japan.
Whether your child’s interest is any matter, there will always be many languages to choose for independent schools, including the experts.
Scottish independent schools are concerned to provide a education environment that will provide children and make them with necessary skills to succeed in the future.
It is not possible to deny that languages play a key role in the country’s future, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered to be “the skill of international communication.”
The independent schools will give this choice, contrast, and appeal for young people in Scotland.
One must be done.

North Korea says "No-No-No-No," without faith.
North Korea's president, the United Nations, told the United Nations that the existing ban on the United States has increased the belief in the United States, and there is no possibility to leave their nuclear weapons alone in the national situation.
Rei Young Hoh, a member of the United Nations General Assembly, said that North Korea had taken the initiative to stop nuclear and nuclear experiments last year, to break the nuclear experiment, and to reduce nuclear technology and nuclear weapons".
"When we didn't see any response in the United States" he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security and there is no way we can do it alone in this national situation."
Although Rysingt's "instigration" method was described by North Korea's complaints against the move of North Korea, his speech was valid because he did not give up as an excuse to misinformation, since he did not give up as much as he did in Pakistan.
In the first assembly between the US President and North Korea's leader in June 12, Kim Zongu, a member of the US President and the leader of North Korea, mentioned that when Kim decided to work on "uneconclusion" of "Kam of Korea" and when the company ordered to do "the nuclear violations of the Indian subcontinent".

“The American has strongly encouraged the "supervatory" and has raised pressure on the restrictions for refusing to compromise their objectives, even against the announcement of "the end of the war."

The problem is, however, the ongoing ban on our beliefs is getting deeper into our confidence."

The Minister Mohodu, instead of the Minister Mum and South Korea leader, spoke of three audiences between ManJin in the last five months, saying: "This issue ofization will not be so great if the U.S. is not in South Korea."
Nevertheless, Ryre’s speech was quite different from the last year when he told the UN General Assembly to register the U.S. headquarters in North Korea with the road to North Korea when "Imal President" was called "Eil President" in suicide.
In the United States, Trop, the last year, threatened to “get completely destroyed” in North Korea, but he praised Kim for her courage to take action, but he said that there must still be a lot of work and bans must be done until the North Korea banning.
On Wednesday, Trop said that there's no time for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't come."
China and Russia argued that Pingang should be rewarded for the move of the U.N. security Council.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State of Myk Pemple has reported to American Americans on Thursday, the security Council of Security: "The bans of the Council should not be taken seriously unless we are fully informed."

Harved's students are working on a lot of rest.
This year, a new Corphin-Affiliation of a new Council at Harved University has been offering all its audiences to sleep more sleep for the rise-up culture to learn during the night.
One teacher discovered that a number of students in the world have often been confused about how to care for themselves.
Harverd, professor of health at Medical School and Brigham and woman hospital staff at Charles Szezi, who believed that it was the first time in the United States.
After giving a speech about the impact of the lack of sleep, he was prompted to start the course.
‘ Why did a girl come to me at the end of this, ’ said a girl to me: ‘ Why did I say this to me so long?
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - which made me wonder, 'Titni telegraph told you.'
This first year, it explained how the school has helped students to develop the good habit of sleeping alone and the Attik Parkman, and that it is necessary to improve their general health.
According to Paul Barrie, students decided to start this court after he got sleepy during the next week, after Harvey's health failed.
One hour long, there's a number of closely related marks in the course.
In a section of a student's room, students will learn about the effect of coffee, screen, teacher and books by clicking on coffee paper, training, and books and how the light and light are affected by the flood of light and a small amount of bread.
In other categories, the participants are told how long sleep can be reduced to a long sleep, stroke, stroke, depression, and cancer
A map of the Camps with interactive icons, then the participants are moved to think about their daily bread.
'We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as if your cigarette is not decided to eat, even if it has the right to share its effects on health, the Facebook series has added to 'Fer'.
He says that "keep awake in the morning" culture is still present, he adds: "A major problem of sleep sleep is a major problem for modern technology and students because of increasing pressure on the students."
In order to be a “disgusting weapon ” to fight against your very good values, a student needs to be a ‘greed weapon’ to fight against hunger and anxiety, he says - even make sleep-satisfaction their loyalty. "
A 19-year-old Ramd So, professor of speech and physical science in California, helped design the course of 19-year-old Ramd So, Professor Szezila, to make a class of his first year in Harved.
He said that this course opened his eyes and touched him for a camp-wheel-wade Corre.
In the next step, he hopes that the students will ask for a type of social program to complete before they join the contest.
Professor Seychelle recommended when students have to go to bed and when they're going to wake up, to consider the impact of a alarm and the impact of the 'Infected Light' by the Eidine Screen and Eli Al Alto, which may have on the impact of the damage that your circuitian blasts have destroyed, caused, and caused the loss of sleep.
Linington 1 - 0 Renances: Consumption of Mangarer Gallhar's Guard.
Renez saw another Avos Masche victory over the 1-0s.D., in the middle of the first century C.E.
After the start of February, the group of Iberra's Center for War 4-11 wins another victory, but Garry Holt's group gave him the second victory as 18 Mayor, which led him to a second defeat as Laudrok’s president.
In the past seven minutes of Hoff-Time, Manga was injured, but I hope Renance lines were never able to touch them.
Renances have gone down to the bottom of the line, raised in the third place, and followed the Hibaranian in the background.
And there may be other problems for Renance because the lineman Calsman Camp Spain had to be treated for something that could not be beyond the border.
The George team has changed eight steps that have moved Ayer to the border with the top hat in the city of Betford.
On the other hand, Holt went up with the same Livi, who took a point from Herts last week and was proud of the way his so-called group was to synonym its pride.
If the Rangers's call can be ruled, the Livings have done more than they're talking to them.
The first time I sent La-off Al-Al-Lan McGrigrey, they should only be made high in two minutes, but the Midfielder destroyed his big chances.
A long-term Free-Correction officer in Kjchen Jacobs found Kregga Gallett, but his anti-centric secretary Al Lathgo was able to hit only the back post.
Renances were retrospected, but they expected more than their faith in the Firewall.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that because of the conflict with Stephen Lleisle, he and his wife had to get his pentier at Cerreen-Awave, but Referrien Stésen Thomson's appeal to the Colombia.
The Renances could only take two seats at the top of the first seat, but the problem was relatively low by William Lélilla Lusullayli’s head and Ovier's seat.
The 4th minute of Livire's 4th minute is probably against the game stroke, but none can deny that they are the only one of their own playrs.
There was a failure to resolve the D-Ps-Ps in the register's database again.
There was no response to Scott and Fefey to the call of the Dekran Galager Scott and Rebinson, who kept my head in order to choose Mangan for the common fining.
He was taking a break with the Red Army to change the Quilli Continent and was often used to deal with the situation as the Wenger was in Morler, but he was also leaving him from line to block.
However, the Livingstones started to enjoy the kind of game they played, Lithoggo and Helet were sending long before long.
Holt's team could also take up their body at the end of the line, but it was held before the attempt of the McGregorger Jobs was to break up before they broke off the Lithgo.
Thomas again turned his face to the request of the captain of the suit of the Tower Penalel, who claimed to be the title of the Latin Penalal.

The system has to get blocked cells out of Russians and replace them with changes in Lane.
Then they can look for a common protocol for cancer and then re-report it again.
An experimentist Viccin has shown positive results with cancer patients.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccination that teaches the Emien system to identify harmful cells has been seen for more than 18 months.
In the system, they are retrospected, changed to test them so that they can see the common causes of a lot of cancers in HER2 and then re-baptize the cells.
“Our results show that we have a lot of hope,” said Professor J.B.B.B.S.A., U.S.A., in the United States, in the United States.
HER2 increases the cancer of various cancers along with the HER2 "Brebbrets, Dusfus, and coconcious cancers", Professor Barzzoffski explains.
A similar method of treating people outside the patient’s immune cells and "How to prevent the cancer cells" has been used to treat them with the same kind of cure for their “supervatory”.

They said, 'Don't go out after the hat.'
They let me go!

To see a new picture with British tyres, it is now traditional and it is thought to be a traditional, German English-Camde-Chief-Puffs, which began in 2003 and returned to England in 2011, and John English returned to life in English.
How clearly do we have that waste-of-affiliation that is gonna be the chance of a new Rafat?
In any case, the license to create new things like a blind-looking, Rabar-bour-breed, unable to make new things like new English - indicates that he is a complex design designed for filming the world without English.
He must have made a note of a brief account of Mr. bin bin bin bin in 2012, a former anti-retrovirus of the Apocalypse of the Olympics of Fire in 2012.
He was primarily based on the Torreves, and an international spy man from Atkinkinson once a forgeted Barcocked TV releases, which caused a lot of confusion in China.

It's the end of a prime minister's trust that has already been a full-of-destruction of politics, that he is ill and close person: Ama Thomas Thomson has ordered his best act by the leader, but there is nothing more to do in the script.
His granddaughters told him that each active spy has been locked, so he must be able to get someone out of the house.

For emergency Briffing, English came back to the Whiteh and again Ben Milli was re-enacted with his long - long bikey bike.

All the post must have been closed for the last stage, but it's a lot of children thinking about TV.
It's too hot.
And I couldn't think like other John English movies: British movies can't give a role to the British film Rohan Atkins who is right to judge the truth?
