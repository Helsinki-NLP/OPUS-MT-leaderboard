Welch's AM (assembly member) is concerned with 'muppet-like images'
There is a bottleneck among some members of the Assembly over the suggestion that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (Welsh MP).
The reason for this is that the name of the Legislative Assembly is planned to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
All those involved in politics are concerned that it can make fun of them.
One Labour AM said its group was concerned about "not connecting it to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
A Plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent" on the name change, but noted that the MWP could be mapped out by making a small change orally in words.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is done exactly as in the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal draft on the name change, said: “The final decision of any deponent in what is called the members of the Assembly will certainly be a matter for the members themselves.”
According to the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported on the results of public consultations on proposals that had received considerable support for renaming the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of the AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMP, but found the most support MWP option in public advice.
Apparently, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but Presiding Officer Elin Jones is finding it hard to get a consensus, hoping to submit a legal draft for a change within a few weeks.
The legislation, which is being prepared for changes, will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the rules for AM's disqualification and the draft of the committee system.
At the time of debate on law-making, AM will receive the last vote on the question of what they should be called.
The people of Macedonia are going to vote to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was bid to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, a province also known as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour tells about its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president, a rival to the name change, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev, as well as supporters of the referendum, has argued that the name change is only a way to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing in Harlem because of the declining churches
"The elderly I spoke to for historical reasons, they say, used to have bars and churches on every nook and corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, everything is going to end."
He said that it is understandable that the bar is being lowered.
He said, "Today, people's society is being formed in a different way."
“The bar is no longer like the living room of the neighborhood where people go every day.”
For the churches, they worry that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect, “and soon these money will run out or later those leaders will come to the right place from where they started.”
He added that the churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of people who would not help in securing the remaining places of worship in the vicinity.
"These buildings will continue to grow in the number of people who are buying a property, and so there will be a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who are coming to these properties will become members of these churches," he said.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin, both churches were built by white people of religious society before becoming the Black Metropolitan Community of Harlem.
The original white people of the Methodist religious society moved in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of religious society who used to worship in nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was taken over by a black religious society under the pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, the place prominent for shopping in Harlem, where black people were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the bell started ringing here after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's successor pastor David Johnson proudly called the bell ringing work "opening the doors of fortune to the poor."
The bell-ring expert in July described it as something like this: it’s “a cultural heritage” and “a precious historical instrument.”
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionysos A. Lind, who played a huge bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marriveder told that no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin over the past few months became the complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the church’s general leaders and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
The parishes made up of common leaders on Vestry (where worship goods are kept) became the authority - in July there was concern in the province that the province would "demand to meet the costs" for Vestry, regardless of whether or not Vestry was involved in hiring artisans and contractors appointed to the province.
Some pastors in the area complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old boy was injured in an attack by a shark while diving to catch a crab.
Officials say a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, while he was holding a crab while diving into California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach in Ansinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hummel, from San Diego's KSWB-TV, said he had been swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time he heard the sound of a boy screaming for help and then he along with a group rushed to get him out of the water.
Hummel reported that at first he felt like the boy had voiced in the excitement of catching a crab, but then he realized he was yelling, "I'm cutting something!"
Something's cutting me off!"
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire body was broken.
Hummel said, "I called everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!"
The teenager was admitted to the Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles further stated that the upper part of the victim's torso was severely injured.
Authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swamis Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to include department store-styled Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams by hiring expert assistants with beauty products.
Despite the continued decline in fashion goods and home goods sales, it is going to join the UK's 2.8 billion pound beauty market with good volume, these large quantities of beauty products will be examined in 11 stores across the country and if the plan succeeds, businesses at more stores will be expanded next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double its offerings by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique makeup products, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small-scale shoppers somewhat faster.
Additionally, Perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also examine the special feature in two stores in Sainsbury's, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second is set to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e., the daily volume of food sold in the supermarkets, in the reduced shift.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, explained that people will come to the outlet more quickly like department stores as the supermarket chain is trying to compete with more services and non-food discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened several stores since it brought the two chains together two years ago, indicating that the sale of groceries has been promoted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to market beauty and pharmacy products again had failed.
Sainsbury's did business with Boots in the early 2000s, but had to put an end to this mixed business because of the way the incomes from drug stores in its supermarkets split.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business's 281 stores to Selesio, owner of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, followed by the new strategy.
Lloyds will play a key role in the plan by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy, as well as several great luxury skincare brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look-and-color of our beauty products, to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also specially trained colleagues who will help us in giving advice.
We’ve built our brand’s scope to suit everyone’s needs and attractive surroundings and in convenient locations, which means we’ve reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones expresses disappointment over Holly Willoughby's separation from 11 million pounds deal
When TV presenter Holly Bilubi decided to pull out of the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for Dragons Den's star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, Peter Jones showed "disgusting" on it.
Bilubi doesn't have time at all for its homewear and accessories brand Truey.
The business of the two was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced her separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi stepped away from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute with Dragons Den star Peter Jones - so that she can focus fully on her new best-in-class contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have revealed that when TV’s Golden Girl admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at Jones’s business headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that she was separating from her new deal – valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – that’s not enough time for Jones to give up on it, it means Bilubi now has enough of his homewear brandy.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was being considered to double the estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million offered by Willoughby.
Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was separating from True, after which Jones left the UK to move to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truely was at the top of Holly’s priorities ever.
It was supposed to be his long-term future, which would make this brand go a long way in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was too close to start.
The warehouse at Marlowe Headquarters is full of goods that are to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of Britain's richest morning presenter could cost the firm several million dollars because it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and there is a possibility that it may also be delayed to begin.
Also, it can end a long friendship.
Bilubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past 10 years.
Willoughby started Truely in 2016 with Cap and joined Jones as chairman in March, 52.
Baldwin's TV production firm has a 40 per cent stake in the holiday-wearing couple and Jones.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be replaced by Ant McParty to host I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
“We would not like to comment on their business case,” a source close to Jones said last night.
"We had a lot of conversations and then we agreed."
He mocked the criticism, saying the news media would continue to comment on him, with some calling it "a different job from the presidency" and becoming much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "News Anchor" voice.
"I didn't sacrifice anything."
He said Kim's interest was in the second meeting since his first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step taken by Trump to make North Korea nuclear-free.
However, the nuclear-free negotiations were halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for a "compatible response" from the U.S. to its initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the U.S. has continued to pressurize to maintain sanctions, he said.
Trump's rally speech saw his much-anticipated approach.
"We are engaged in good relations with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
in which millions of people were killed.
We have a very good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing a rocket test, helping to free hostages and sending the remaining U.S. troops back to their homes.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
Directly pointing to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, “It’s very easy to remain in the presidency, but there are 10,000 people outside the country trying to join the area, we’ll only have about 200 people to stop them.”
An island devastated by a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia, hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they did not need them for the incident.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lombok's population being devastated, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition for international aid.
“In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly seeing that they weren’t asking for international help, so it turned out to be a bit more challenging,” Ms. Sumbu said.
Still, Save the Children visited Palu together with a team, but it is not yet clear whether staff from other countries can come here to offer assistance.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, said the Indonesian authorities were taking stock of Palu's situation and looking into whether international agencies would allow contributions to the aid effort.
Looking at such situations repeatedly coming to Indonesia, it seems that there is no preparation at all for the outbreak of nature in this country.
However, shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunamis in Aceh, but they are not like shelters on other beaches.
Palu has seen a decrease in sirens warning for tsunamis, no matter how damaging that warning is, it is likely to lead to increased loss of life.
Regardless of the best time to visit, it is challenging to go to the middle of many islands in Indonesia.
It is always difficult to arrange for workers and goods from natural disasters.
The victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment which is far away from Palu and it takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made the very bad infrastructure of Indonesia an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration was split because of a lack of funds as elections are due to be held again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than 10,000 became homeless, as Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge takes a mysterious bow and equalises with Chelsea
At Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute to save Liverpool from being knocked out of the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Zerdan Shakiri from a distance of about 30 yards, at which time his team was trailing 1-0 with the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a very post-shot.
His attempt went to the right top corner of the net with the height above the box.
Eventually, the ball fell out of Cape Ariasablaga's grip and went into the net.
"It was just an attempt to get to that point, to get in touch with the ball and get as far away from players like Shaq as possible, so I just tried to take as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante was coming and touched once and didn't think too much about it and just hit the shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in half-time after Belgium's best player Aiden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball reached near the midfield and reached the Liverpool half game, the Blues striker handed the pass to Matteo Kovasik in that game.
Kowasik delivered the ball very quickly in the midfield.
Then, he beautifully put the shot on the ball, moving into the Hazard box.
Hazard walked out of the defence and shot from the left leg behind Liverpool's Allison Baker and sent away from the net.
Liverpool will now take on Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will take on Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.

The country's disaster agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a 20-foot-high tsunami on Friday were reported to have left many people trapped in the rubble.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, had several buildings collapsed, filling the city with debris.

The statue of Cromwell in front of the Parliament recently became the most famous monument, it was re-recorded in ‘history’
Its deportation would be ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts created by its radical Puritan followers like its Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The ongoing debate on the removal of the statues had raised all fears that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
No order was given for the symbol of the English Civil War, nor did Cromwell make it.
It may be wrong that Cromwell may have sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, Cromwell's best representation is evidence of the idea of the 19th century and part of the history of a statue that many still consider admirable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps that's why most people still know him as a defender of parliament standing against external pressures in the matter of monarchy at the end of the 19th century.
Yet, they are considered to be absolutely accurate representatives, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is obvious that our nation has been developing since the mid-17th century conflict, and Cromwell's statue remains a personal identity that reflects one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable.”
The deadly pig attacked the Chinese farmer, killing the farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that only his nickname "Yuan" was identified, his body was found to have serious injuries, his body was found lying in a pool of blood near a market in Lippensui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig-breed farmer in Xining, China's Qinhai province, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs with his cousin, who lives in nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his cousin died and it was found that a pig-tail door was open nearby.
He said that he saw a very large male pig in the boar-bar with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked and killed the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and completely injured," said her cousin, nicknamed "Wu," according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan had come to the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked the person and killed him was not of the Yuan or his Kazan.
Evening News was told by a market manager that the pig was locked up so that it could not attack a person, although police collected evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family members and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of people being attacked by pigs in the past too.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their farm causing the person to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer at the time he was on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife ran away scaring the animal.
In 2012, a Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs and killed and made his own food, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" if they get a taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite the teeth and are very inventive...they don’t tend to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remaining part of the storm Rosa caused heavy rain in southwestern America
According to the forecast, the storm Rosa is becoming weaker due to moving to the cold water off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, due to Rosa, there will be flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa recorded a wind speed of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 mph southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa is set to reach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much of the tropical moisture will begin to subside in the northern regions of southwestern America.
More than 10 inches of rain is expected in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, the moisture coming from the trough in the coming days will combine with the tropical moisture bringing heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous floods, landslides and landslides in the desert.
Very high tropical moisture will cause the rainfall rate to drop to 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in southern Nevada and some areas of Arizona.
Most parts of the Southwest, especially Arizona, are expected to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the sporadic nature of tropical rainfall, there can be a lot of flooding with poor conditions.
Reasonable advice will be given to stay out of low-lying deserts in view of the risk of tropical rainfall.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become dangerous rivers and along with the cloudburst, strong winds and dust will prevail in the local areas.
The incoming trough will bring heavy rain locally in some parts of southern California coast.
The total rainfall is likely to be more than half an inch, which may lead to some extent of debris drifting and slippery conditions on the roads.
This will be the first rain in the region.
There will be some sporadic tropical rain in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures may change rapidly throughout the U.S. in the month of October as the Arctic weather cools at this time, but there is a lot of heat in the tropical regions.
Sometimes there are strange changes in temperature due to this short distance.
The strange change in temperature in the Central U.S. on Sunday is a great example of this.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, due to the heat, the weather will start to warm up and the heat will increase.
In most areas of Central and Eastern U.S., the weather is expected to warm from October, which can range from the southern plains to the wider 80s in some areas of the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Celsius, which will be about 10 degrees above the average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting signals that in the first six months of October, there is a lot of chance that the eastern U.S. temperature will be higher than the average temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blasey Ford, the hearing was shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlock was also seen, with broadcasters stalling Friday's regular program of Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flake after investigating the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure that at a high school party, Kavanaugh had drugged him and tried to take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh defended himself, saying he was absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
It is expected that more than 20.4 million people watched the Nielsen report on Friday.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, as well as other channels that showed it, were not readily available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating the number of people who see it in offices.
From this point of view, it is equal to the number of viewers of the playoff football game or the Academy Award.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, the host to whom the consideration had strongly supported Kaavanaugh's appointment, went ahead of all channels, with an average audience of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing.
The audience on ABC was 3.26 million and it stood second.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen reported.
The audience was very interested.
Flake was the central figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
A statement issued after the term on behalf of the Liberal Republican office said they would raise their voices on behalf of Cavanaugh, who came in front of the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, at which time protesters were shouting to oppose the hearing of the judicial committee.
When he was being abused, he stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Wait, I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think they're telling the country the right thing?"
They were told, "Have you been brought into power to make a lot of women powerless?"
Flake said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was shut down and that he would be able to give his full statement at the hearing of the committee.
While the Judiciary Committee was forwarding Kaavanagh's nomination to the entire Senate for the vote, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
But Flake said he would do so with full understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominees next week, which are being requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake talked about it with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After having a conversation with Coons and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck liked power because it was clearly visible that the approval of Kavanaugh without an investigation would not allow the Republicans to get the vote.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politics" over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May asked critics to stop playing with Britain's future by "playing politics" in the EU and focus their full attention on the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
Just next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, an interview with his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson was printed in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress his attack on him because of the so-called checkers' plan of Brexit, his statement that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other which is "totally meaningless".

Police detained a suspected man for shooting and killing at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Wede was an LSU basketball player.
Dayton Simpson, 20, has been detained and sent to jail on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
The video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released by authorities, and police reported that Sims' glasses were lost at the time of the encounter.
The police have recovered the glasses from the spot and said that according to the WAFB report related to CBS, it was found that the DNA belonged to Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson told the police that he had fatally shot Madden to death.
According to the report of the advocate, it has been set at $350,000 for this.
An initial report from the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office on Friday said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police's Fugutiv Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the people in the area who cooperated with the investigation for custody.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement in the area for its "hard work and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
His length was 6 feet 6 inches, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season's game.

"Now who will replace him, his concern will always remain," Wade said.
Volcano ash found in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatel volcano has been found in the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from volcanoes and reported 183 gas and ash eruptions in 24 hours.
Many tremors and vibrations were being monitored at the centre.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash-coating car windshield in the neighborhood of a city in Mexico, such as Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico, since geophysicists have noted the increasing activity of volcanoes that are 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano named "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists in Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were detained following a clash with pro-independence protesters with rioting police on Saturday, and thousands of rival protesters joined the protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powder paint on riot police, blackening the road, causing inconvenience to commuters.
The police used batons to control the clash and later resorted to lathicharge.
Pro-independence groups chanted "no forgetting, no apologizing" for several hours while Confederate protesters chanted "Spain remains immortal."
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated for injuries caused by the demonstration.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, considered illegal, has been exacerbating tensions in areas with independent views for over a year, but Catalonia's separatists were celebrating it.
Voters chose a great way to achieve independence, though there were few who strongly opposed the vote against secession.
Catalonian officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from marching to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
Groups supporting independence stayed there overnight on Friday to help the National Police to stop the protests.
The performance was pushed forward, but he was forced to take a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narciss Terminus, arrived with his wife to take part in the separatist protest, saying he saw no chance of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Our best year was last year.
I saw my parents cheering by voting, but it seems like we're stuck now," he said.
Despite a small victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain influence with many of their most famous leaders this year, whether in exposing themselves or waiting for their role in organizing the referendum and the continued declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone to help police, said the clashes between politicians on both sides had been halted.
She said, "It's become too stressful."
On Saturday, Orol Junqueres, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial prison since last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the return that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
London: People who attacked the house with a car were detained
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been detained for repeatedly attacking a London derby home with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19:30 BST in Ballinagird Crescent.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemings said that the doors and buildings of the house were damaged.
In some places the crossbow may have been attacked by a car.
Menga beat the Rangers 1-0 to win the match against Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the Ibrox club, the fast-moving Livingston surprised the Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard to take responsibility for his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference which was equaled by Gary Holt's side move with Hibernian in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side was one step away from a victory in this season's premiership and will face the leaders' hearts next Sunday, trailing by eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston has been consistently winning in the six-game division by replacing Kenny Miller last month with head coach Holt.
Livingston missed out on showing off his game to the visitors
Holt's team should have been outplayed long before scoring, plus, their great game caused a number of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but was left behind by an attempt to score, then Alan Lithgo was able to keep his best effort straight after slipping to complete the goal in Craig Lightfoot's header.
The hosts had a chance to play against the Rangers, knowing that they could put the visitors in trouble on the set piece.
And that's how he got that important goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working to set up Menga, who did a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was far behind,
This pattern continued even in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on being saved on the keel.
Scott Pitman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor from the legs and Lithgo completely captured the game by flicking off the second Livingston.
In the Livingston box, the cross continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while after the lightweight challenge, two penalty claims were made, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
An analysis of Livingston's "extraordinary goal"
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont inducted into Tony Macaroni Arena
The extraordinary performance and results of Livingston.
For any person, they were great, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His playing style and personality have changed dramatically since his return from top flight, but most credit goes to Holt's way of reshaping the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of great players.
Captain Lightfoot was a great player, he served brilliantly, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warle behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in the rangers.
The kind of great performance he has done many times under Gerard was less than his standard.
His final ball lacked - he was only able to cut to his home side open once - and it was like a few wake-up calls for the Rangers, who maintained themselves in the mid-table.
Erdogan was welcomed in Cologne.
Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, but to no avail.
This is President Erdogan's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations with NATO's allies.
He remained embroiled in controversies on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke on the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, the city is one of the areas where most Turkish residents live.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, some of them Kurdish, also shouted slogans, strongly condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom considered him a German Turkic hero and others insulted him by calling him a voluntary ruler.
Road accident in Depotford: Cyclist dies after being hit by car
In London, a cyclist died after being hit by a car.
The accident took place at around 10:15 BST in the south-eastern area of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a walk-in road in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him first aid, but the person died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago due to a hit-and-run at Children's Street, about a mile from the accident site.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Such incidents are taking place due to diversions of roads and buses and motorists have been advised to avoid such areas.
Long Lartine Jail: Six officers injured in disturbance
The jail office said that six jail officials were injured due to the disturbances in the jails of high-security men.
At around 09:30 BST on Sunday, there was some disturbance in the HMP Long Lartine in Worcestershire and is still continuing.
The specialist "Tornado" authorities have been called in to fix the disturbance, the disturbances are in a wing that housed eight prisoners.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the spot which were treated.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to correct the accident at the HMP Long Larten.
The injuries of six employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that the persons responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they may be imprisoned.”
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Larten, some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the jail governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the jail governor was treated in the hospital.
Also, in October last year rioting officers were called to jail to correct a serious disorder, during which the employee was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
The threat remains in the tropics after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but its full potential is likely to be the same in the coming weeks that the storm's remaining potential could affect Desert Southwest, which poses a high risk of flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada in western Arizona, southeastern California, and Utah, are likely to be flooded.
The rain on Monday evening is expected to pass directly through the entire Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained a tropical storm or depression state since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Hurricane AZ border.”
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that the Mogolon rim in Arizona could receive up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, as well as, up to 6 inches of rain.
The Central Rockies and the Great Basin, as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest, are likely to receive rainfall ranging from 1 to 2 inches, as well as, up to 4 inches.
Outside the high flood risk areas, Rosa’s rain may prove to be a boon as the area is dry.
Although the floods remain a very serious concern, there is a drought situation in the Southwest right now, which is likely to benefit greatly from the rains.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just 40 percent of Arizona's area is extremely dry, the second-highest category of drought," the weather.com report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, the maximum wind speed of the storm was 85 mph, at that time it was 385 mph south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is now moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific region, due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the strength of the tropical storm could lead to landslide conditions in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rain is likely in some areas of Mexico, which may increase the risk of flooding.
"It is expected that Baja will rain from California to northwestern Sonora by 3 to 6 inches, as well as, it is also expected to be 10 inches," according to the report of "weather.com."
After that, Rossa will make a tropical storm and move across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning to the north, after which it will move south into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is to Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, where heavy rain is likely," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these rains are likely to cause severe flooding and landslides in the deserts and may result in landslides in the hilly areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four people detained for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor in Somerset was found to be in injured condition after he was attacked with a knife for which three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been detained in conspiracy to murder.
The teenage boy was found in injured condition in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital for treatment where his condition is stated to be "okay."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight from the Redstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The authorities have also appealed to the people to contact them if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump calls Kavanaugh's trouble the Democratic Party's anger
“Judge Kavanaugh is a man who has been denied by the ruthless and outrageous strategy of the Democratic Party,” Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says the trouble Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared Congress for what Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting Ford several decades ago in his teenage years, when Kavanaugh forcefully and emotionally denied this.
Ford also gave his testimony about the accusation during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, “The residents of the United States saw the quality and courage of Kavanaugh being the best human being that day.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, "Voting Judge Kavanaugh means voting for a man who is one of the most accomplished jurists of our time, can confirm the law and do justice with the true record of public service."
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
"It's only five weeks away from the election that's most important to our lives.
I'm not involved in it, but I'm actually involved in it," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are really qualified."
Trump said Democrats are on a campaign to "oppose and block."
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the Senate's first counting of votes in Kavanaugh's nomination is set to begin on Friday.
Earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds dead, death toll rising
Officials said on Saturday that when a huge earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died.
A festival was being celebrated on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday in which hundreds of people gathered, after the evening when waves of six meters (18 feet) high rose up, it had created havoc, causing the death of many people and also the destruction of everything around them.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the tsunami hit, people in the middle were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately and got stuck,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only caused the deaths, but it also dragged cars, logs, and houses to the ground, before hitting the beach, traveling at an open sea speed of 800 km per hour (497 mph)," Nugroho said.
He said some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Photos posted from the plane by the disaster agency showed that several buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
The subsequent shock continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced frequent earthquakes.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the capacity of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It was reported that the geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho explained the damage in detail, saying it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said the bodies of some people were trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, in which 540 people were injured while 29 people were unaccounted for.
There is a high probability of casualties and damage in the area called Dongala, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, close to the epicentre of the quake, Nugroho said.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in Dongala was "completely damaged."
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living in the area and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
“Earlier it was a tragic event, but it could be even more terrible,” it said.
On Saturday, the agency criticised why it was not informed earlier if there was a tsunami coming to Palu, although officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already passed.
Some videos were made by a person amateurishly and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the situation on the upper floor of the building was giving a person the sound of people on the street below and in it a frightening warning can be heard.
Within a few minutes, too much water started coming out of the middle and even pulled buildings and cars along with it.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut communication lines, making it difficult for authorities to link rescue efforts together.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have begun to send cargo planes, officials said, adding that there is still a need to evacuate people and meet food as well as other requirements.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesia tsunami has risen to more than 800.
Its very scary.
Mr. Doseba informed that the World Vision staff at Donggala made every effort to make Palu city safe, the employees were living in the premises of their office by making tarpaulin shelters, they have seen the devastation with their own eyes.
"On talking to him, it was revealed that he saw a lot of houses being destroyed," he said.
Its very scary.
Support groups started bringing supplies for disaster relief seriously, with some complaining that external support personnel with special expertise were being denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, money, goods and staff can only be taken from abroad if the disaster zone is declared a national disaster zone.
But that hasnt happened yet.
“The disaster is still at the provincial level,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian-based Red Cross.
“After the government has said that it is a national disaster, only then can we involve international aid personnel in rescue operations but that has not happened so far.”
Even after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, those whose friends and family members could not be traced in Palu were hoping that their loved ones would miraculously find somewhere after the natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was found that a small boy was trapped in the sewer.
A woman was rescued by a rescue team on Sunday and her child was trapped in the rubble for two days next to her.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gandalf Subando, trained two paragliders of the Asian Games to trace the lost, who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, along with his students, was among those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally repressed,” he said.
Gendon said that the paragliding community started its work only after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, they had sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu competitors participating in the beach festival.
However, only gray marks are visible on their message, do not see blue marks on it.
"I think that means that the messages didn't reach people," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM in Newport, Levy
According to a report released by the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, a Brink employee was putting money into an ATM in Levy's Newport, while thieves stole $26,750.
Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put in more money.
While he was busy with his work, only then came “someone ran from behind the employee of Brink” and ran away with a bag of money kept to put it.
According to the report, several people present at the spot are suspected, but the police are yet to ascertain the total number of people present at the spot.
Any person who has information related to their identity should call the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper has changed his name
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name.
About the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "His name will be officially Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has kept his name for some time and will use the name for his eighth album titled Monique, released in June.
The change is being made in his presence on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandi.
The show's producer said he had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
With the shortening of his current professional name, West had already pointed out that the term had religious significance for him.
Talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West had said, “I believe the word ‘this’ has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means ‘you’.”
"So I am you, I am me, this is us."
The word is derived from Kanye, which means just one, which is this – it represents our good, our evil, our illusion, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has named his love and brother love while announcing for the name.
An old friend of West, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-candidate Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed that the military force will never be used for civilian purposes.
On Saturday at Telltaleco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that "military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the peaceful movement in Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to support Mexico’s youth, donate every month to students studying and open as many free government universities as possible.
He said that due to unemployment and lack of opportunities to get education, young people become involved in crime.
The U.S. should double the funding for AI.
Kai-Fu Li, a low-cost investor for Google, Microsoft and Apple, and an AI businessman, said, "As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area."
AI has made this comment after several U.S. government actions, he also said there is a lack of an overall formal AI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China launched a plan last year: it aims to reach number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget will give a great start, let’s take a look at all the other countries separately, so the U.S. is far behind in this matter, and we’re making efforts for the next success of AI.”
“Doubling the fund could double the likelihood that AI’s next big achievement will be in the U.S.,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt earlier this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, an investor in Face<0x2B>, one of China's best AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that left the highest-ranked American Othello player far behind, and later he was appointed executive at Microsoft Research and president at Google's China branch.
Lee improved the technical qualifications of the previous U.S. government, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robot-related challenges, and said who would be the next government that would recognize the next visionary.
Lee pointed out that U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
“It’s not China removing academic leaders, it’s corporate.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired veterans from the university to work on AI.
Lee said that by changing the immigration policy, the U.S. can help with its AI efforts.
“According to me, the permission to do a PhD in AI through a green card should be obtained automatically,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"The way China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people at the Academic Institute, the same way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give financial grants to U.S. researchers, but the quality of teaching work in China is not very good," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department opened a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next that talked about investing $2 billion.
For NSFs, this investment right now is more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation in the U.S. was made that the demand for creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name or not.
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would address the decades-old dispute with Greece that led to Greece banning its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, which says its northern neighbour has its name on its territory, making two names for the same claimant and is already included in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the new name suggested, but nationalist opponents opposed it, saying the renaming of Macedonia would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the people living in Slavic.
President Georg Ivanov said he would not go to the referendum and boycott the campaign, raising doubts that only a minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed for the vote would be valid.
On the voting ballot this question would be written: “Do you give your approval for an agreement to be reached with Greece for NATO and EU membership?”
Supporters of Prime Minister Zoran Zev, as well as those associated with the name change, say Macedonia must become a member of the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, it will allow them to live freely in the shadow of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
Although not legally pushing for it, most members of Parliament say they will act according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name in Parliament.
The State Election Commission (SEC) said there were no reports of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary election was held in 2016, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gojo Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zev along with his wife Zorika and his son Dushko went to Macedonia to cast their vote for a change in the country's name, so that on September 30, 2018, the country's name in Stromica, Macedonia, would join NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, a resident of Skopje, was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament and placing chairs in front of the tents placed by those who are opposed to the vote.
“We definitely want NATO and EU membership, but we want to raise our heads and get involved, not through an agreement,” Kavdarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
If they don’t want to give us membership in the name of Macedonia, no matter what, we can join other countries like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zev has said that NATO membership will provide Macedonia with much-needed investment, with the unemployment rate exceeding 20 percent.
"I think a lot of the vote will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO," Zev said after casting his vote.
He said the "yes" result would "confirm our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters will vote in the required voting.
A second survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent of the votes are needed for the election to be successful.
If the vote fails, it will be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy to be made in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score goals
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Stirling took on Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Ironically, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in the midfield in the early stages.
As soon as he landed in the open field, he got three Brighton players to defend.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a defender before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give Aguero back the ball, Aguero used his left boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball went out from his right side to the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, “Aguero has had some problems with his legs which makes him upset.”
"We talked 55, 60 minutes on their game.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time."
But, it was because of sterling that gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He pulled the ball out beautifully from Leroy Sen's left side.
Sen made a few touchdowns before sending off the good playing sterling.
Just before the game slipped by hand, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League Group Play will now take on Hoffenheim at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neker-Arena in Sinsim, Germany.
Shearer wants to beat him by playing against the Rockies
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no major reason to insist on another start.
However, the ever-competing skater hopes to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs for the Rockies are still just a possibility, having won the game played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies gained a wild-card spot by registering a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Even though we haven't been able to play very well, we can at least play to find out that the crowd and the other team-mate Denver's atmosphere will probably be for the highest level game I'll face this year."
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that game?"
The Nationals are yet to announce the starter for Sunday, but it is being heard that in such a situation, the shaver can be included.
Shazar, who plays for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander remained at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court to Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work we have done will be at stake in November.
There are only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a very big election - I'm not involved, but I'm really involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates," he said.
Trump added: "You can take a look at this much-hyped radical group of Democrats, you can see everything that's happening right now.
Moreover, they are trying to grab power by using other necessary means, which you know is meaningless and useless.
In order to get power and control, they don't care who is unhappy, who is capable of it, they just want power and control here, but we won't let that happen."
He pointed out that the Democrats' campaign is "opposition and obstruction."
"In addition, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you have seen the anger of the Democrats and you have also seen how mean and bad they are," he said.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee as Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, who was widely praised by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
What.
No, no, no, I'm looking forward to what - whose body language was really very bad - the first time I saw such a bad body language."
Working is no longer a broad church.
For those who speak their mind, it is not worth being able to bear it
When the activists leading my local party voted to choose me, it was a big surprise for me.
After all, I am the newest among the Labour MPs whose importance has been greatly diminished - we cannot say everything in our minds.
This is what happened to my MP colleague Joan Ryan because she also raised her voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Censor Motion condemned me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsibly on the importance of economic policy, on national security, there were very similar problems in Europe, which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
“We wish that all things are included in the meeting and these are beneficial,” said Friday for the Nottingham East Labour meeting.
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I mostly saw that Friday Night GC meeting was exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree and or promise that the politics of "kind and gentle people" are really forgotten, here also happened.
It is clear that if the Labour Party views are different, they are not tolerated and for every consideration a decision is made whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started immediately after Jeremy became the leader, with colleagues for whom I had previously thought they had a political opinion like me, expecting me to turn around and work in positions I could never agree with — whether it was national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - bad words are seen on social media, sharp comments are made on it, Centre politics is condemned and I'm told I don't deserve the Labour Party.
Plus, it’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are associated with politics.
I know how businesses work and am dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but don’t shy away from raising their voices.
In today’s political era, there are many disappointing aspects, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and every proposal of “no-confidence” or change in the party’s selection rule has been greatly reduced.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to stay quiet, not speak too much, and then "be right."
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was engaged in labor as a school student, I was provoked to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to leave the wider class of my school altogether, I demanded better public services for the people who need them the most — whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including politics done in the last election.
There is no one in the Nottingham East who has any doubt about my policy position and any area of disagreement about my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will damage homes, businesses, and our public services, I don't think it's necessary for the Labour Party to waste their time and energy in showing its sincerity.
But, actually, I have a message that’s not for Nottingham Momentum, it’s for my supporters, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud that I’m serving you and I promise that my work can’t create any undue risk or political campaign disruption, I’m only interested in things that are of interest to all of you.

Iron 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Iron Reach the Top
The two late attempts may have had an impact on the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Air Tennant deserved to win in this great entertaining match of Premiership.
Now they are only at the top of the table of ten undefeated sides.
In the end, his defense was excellent, he found the best opportunity he could get, which allowed him to take the home team forward and give coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
“We thoroughly checked our game and we’re still undefeated, so it makes me happy.”
Robin Christie of Melrose pointed out: “The credit for this goes to Iyer, who cashed in on his opportunity as much as possible.”
In the 14th minute of Grant Anderson's attempt, Frazier Klimo had to face the iron, but the Warriors gave Scotland player Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which Melrose got a chance to score, and Jason Bagen made a very difficult attempt.
With the help of penalty just before half-time, Klimo extended the iron, he scored and then tried to unilaterally tie the match 17-5 for the iron at break time.
But Melrose remained better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was turned into a goal by Baggott, reducing Lewe's five points.
After that, Ruridih Knott suffered a serious injury that caused the game to be stopped for a long time, he had a stretch, then after the start of the game, Iyer went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowell, which Climo converted into a goal.
At the time, Iron's team captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and then due to too much pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an attempt to extra-man Bruce Colvin who failed to cash him out.
However, the host team was left behind and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card from the penalty line-out to face Billa Ball's Klimo, McPherson did a touchdown by pushing the iron from behind.
After Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent Flanker Gregor Henry away for home side's fifth attempt, Clemo turned it into a goal, as they could when the game resumed.
The star of the game is still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Game star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to get into the hospitality industry, some time ago it was revealed that he was selected to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old has been associated with Jarvis' famous BBC show, in which he works as a writer and has long been associated with the acting of comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The two have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last series in the show's world, and it looks like they're planning what to do after Kernan Kruggle.
On the basis of the official record list, he is the Director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a source in a Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join an "enormous restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': Land-restricted Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way for the Pacific
Military-navigators are patrolling the Naval Headquarters of La Paz on a large scale.
Ocean-blue flags are being hoisted on government buildings.
Here is a slogan of the naval base stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back."
The coastal region of Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the 19th century in a terrible land battle, is still desperate to get its land - they want to once again wave their flag in the Pacific Ocean.
He now hopes to regain his Bolivian territory decades ago, as it awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia now has a lot of enthusiasm, a sense of unity and peace, and a positive result is expected from the people of Bolivia,” said Roberto Calazilla, Bolivia’s diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the decision that will come from The Hague's court will be in Bolivia's favor - which has been under negotiation for decades - Chile has been forced by means of negotiations to return Bolivia's land to the sea.
Bolivia's best President Evo Morales - who is set to face a controversial contest in next year's re-election - also showed positives in Monday's ruling.
Last August he said, “We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean.”
But some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and even if the decision is in its interest, there will be plenty of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to award the Chilean province, and has decided that the possible outcome of the talks will not be determined.
Paz Zeret, a Chilean expert at the International Court of Justice, said the ICJ's decision comes six months after the final talks in which what was heard indicated that the case was "not complicated."
In addition, apart from the conditions of Bolivia, the past four years have seemed like it could get back to the old position again.
“The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia.”
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had put an end to Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate certain conditions, but this time it will be very difficult to negotiate once the decision is made.
The ambassadors of the two countries have not been living in each other’s country since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, who was in the Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually fast.
He said Monday would be an "excellent opportunity" for Bolivia to open up new relations with Chile and would be an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
Callazila has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was doing politics over the maritime problem.
“Bolivia will never back down for its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he explained.
“The decision is a chance to go over what we needed to do in the past.”
North Korea says it will not stop nuclear testing unless it is trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb unless Washington is trusted.
Rei delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit between the leaders of other countries in Singapore.
He commented that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo felt he was about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong-un made promises in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would give the North a defeat from sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the consensus of the already-running important disarmament campaign without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit to take place.
But, it is entirely doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about ending the inspection of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to risk the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which is expected to be hosted by Kim-Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show featured a variety of new design headwear for your nearest High Street
If you have to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, then there is no need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Tom Brown designers have created a series of excellent headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway, which was featured at the famous Paris Fashion Week in a special style.
The best beneficial hats have been created to avoid this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show on the show.
The finest hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with wings-like broad beams that hung around the model's head.
The second accessory with a much larger side included bezel-designed watermelon hats, wizard hats, and pineapple-designed hats - but they aren't designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Brown also showed special-designed masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colorful masks and things like the Haute Couture were seen as more affordable than the Haute Couture.
One creation saw all kinds of items for scuba diving, including snowbelts and glasses, while the other creation saw a design with a molten ice cream cone.
Also, if you've seen a much larger fashion - you're lucky.
Style-seeing enthusiasts estimate that this great collection may soon reach the fine shops around you.
The very large-sized hat will come with a 'La Bomba' design with a heel, a two-foot-wide breamed straw hat from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski will be able to buy.
Behind the best-effortful hat was a belt label that looked pretty, with the second creation catwalk posted on social media - showing the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia bag was trimmed with Rafia Fringing and had a white leather handle, making it the best attraction of Jacques' La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion’s famous celebrity Luke Armitage said in an email: ‘I hope big hats and beach bags will come in stores soon for the upcoming summer season – because designers have been so impressed by it that the demand for large-sized accessories will be difficult to ignore.’
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for citizens of foreign countries
Scotland’s private schools keep track of the track record of best education, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver excellent exam results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under the leadership of which these schools are trying to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement a school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be the preferred choice of popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, you become the best for him.”
If you talk to him in his own language, it makes his heart feel good.”
When we want to build a relationship and trust people in other countries, we feel we can rely more on English.
In this year’s exam results, we can see that languages with the highest pass rates in private schools top the league table.
68% of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by 74 member schools of the SCIS can be seen that 72 per cent students achieved the highest grade A in the Mandarin language, while 72 per cent students achieved the highest grade A in the German language, 69 per cent students in the French language and 63 per cent students achieved the Spanish language grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being integrated into the curriculum of private schools as an optional subject and other subjects like STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that employers struggled a lot to hire employees in vacant positions, with 17 percent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative to have more and more language skills to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential for working anywhere in the world due to the greater potential employment opportunities that the language needs.
No matter what choice is made for a career, if people have learned a second language, then such skills will definitely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, then being a multilingual person will automatically get you ahead in the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK took part in the YouGov survey, which found that 75 percent of people did not speak enough in a foreign language, and that French was the only subject that 15 percent could speak and was the only one to reach double-digit percentage.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching children the language.
Having knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will enable children to get better opportunities to find the right jobs.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that have a 2020 outlook and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interest in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also find the staff who teach it to those who are experts in this field.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need for success, so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages really should be accepted as “international communication skills.”
Young people in Scotland will continue to be given the option to choose this option, variety and excellence by private schools.
It's a failure to be fair.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
On Sunday in San Diego, LeBron started as part of the Lakers
Now the wait time for LeBron James fans is coming to an end as they are soon going to play their first match for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been named as the preseason opener for Sunday's game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes they will play is yet to be decided.
“They will play at least one minute and as much as 48 minutes,” the Lakers told through the official website.
James is likely to play for a limited time, Lakers correspondent Mike Trudel tweeted.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t have to be ready for the preseason game.”
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In Wheeling, West Virginia tonight, President Donald Trump held a lot of rallies for the campaign.
Next week, Trump has scheduled five more rallies, including Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other friendly venues.
With a hold on the vote scheduled in his election to appoint a vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump's goal is to seek help for the upcoming mid-term election as Republicans risk being out of Congress' control at the time of the vote count in November.
When will there be a Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
The time of Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia has been fixed for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7pm ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is likely to deliver a Trump speech at this week's hearing, with Kavanaugh being barred from confirming a Senate vote expected for a week during the FIT's investigation due to allegations of sexual misconduct.
But the main goal of this tense rally is to help Republicans face the November elections.
“The five rallies next week are aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters as a Republican effort to protect and enhance the Senate and House of Representatives’ stalled majority,” President Trump told Reuters during the campaign.
According to Reuters, a spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress control has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit states where our campaign season will be very busy."
According to West Virginia Metro News, “Settled in Wesbanko Arena of Wheeling, tonight’s rally could bring the attention of Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters to the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the area he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to try to help candidate Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind in the West Virginia Republican Senate survey.
According to Reuters, Simon Hyder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, “If the president is trying to get Morris to take the lead in the election, that’s not a good sign for him.”
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed willingness to compete to keep their hopes of staying on top of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will give the result of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The cycle of time is a completely new concept for players, but it cannot be predicted in competitions such as when a player goes ahead and who is to be trusted.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead that's now four, so I think we have to increase our pace a little bit," said Jordan Spieth while walking through the day.
Of course, Europe got the advantage and went ahead by four points with 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the American feels they have little or no chance left and a lot to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both earned three out of four points from their game.
Spieth is deadly for everyone from tea to green and is also the best in the game.
As their game progressed, people enthusiastically cheered with loud applause, when they and Thomas went down two more points after two, putting significant putts to complete four all-squads.
It was because of his putt that his team came in 15th position with the same scrimmage, sort that tells you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
“You just have to play really well and take care that the win is yours,” said Spieth.
That's what they call all the players who have been out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are making history in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different-styled but better couple scored four points in four and are at the forefront.
Saturday afternoon is "Mollywood" was the only pair who didn't shoot any bogies, but they stayed away from bogies until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning before nine o'clock.
On Sunday, that run and the way to get that run came from this strong crowd and from this strong crowd as if they were bettors, and there was no player who could turn the European team's possible win into defeats, it seemed that Le Golf National's sunset would be earlier than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is better that the two are on different holes in different ways.
However, the European pride has been talked about for a long time.
Boba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball's hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, with their pair being made with Alex Noreen at the time.
In front of nine dugs, one bogey and two doubles by Spaniards and Swedes, they had never been able to reach here before.
However, on Sunday there was no one to help you reach your hole.
Foreball and Foursome were great at watching, because the interaction between pairings was great, they advised that they did not need to seek advice and that they were well acquainted with how to change the strategy.
Europe as a team played very well and took a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the team USA has the ability to compete in a way that is doubtful, especially on the status side.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead.
Europe will take advantage of it on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead over the United States on Saturday.
The best pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over Tiger Woods, struggling with two wins, to put their Milan far ahead of Le Golf National's four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European Side Morning Foreball to avenge his defeat two years ago in the Hezaltine dominated the series with an American side misfiring, giving him a 3-1 lead.
The U.S. showed more resistance in Foursam, winning two matches, but they couldn't avoid losing.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles match to maintain the trophy win.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari started with "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, the second pair to win four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in Foreball, he again beat the best player Woods and American Rookie Bryson Deshambu by 5 and 4 points to make it to the finals.
Woods, who led his side in two matches on Saturday, has now lost 29 of his matches in Foreball and Foursam and seven of Roe's 19 times.
In the rest of the morning foreball, Justin Rose returns to the Foursome with his partner Henrik Stenson and beat the world's ranked one and three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1.
However, in the south-west of Paris, on Breezy Day, Europe had no break from it.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas on Saturday set the benchmark for the American by scoring two points.
In the first two holes, he defeated the Spaniards John Raham and Ian Polter 2-1 and sent back Pauls and Rory McLellroy 4-3 in the opening two holes.
This has happened only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team came back from a single match by scoring four points, although the kind of need that Furyk had on the side kept everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, Sunday's counter-attack after being second-best for two days is going to be something that's different from their old game.
North Korea says there is "no way" to say disarmament will only be of one side that cannot be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday the United Nations continued sanctions that were based on its distrust of the United States and showed no way the country would stop inspecting a nuclear bomb on its own in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly that last year North Korea had tried a number of ways that were associated with "significant goodwill," such as stopping nuclear bomb and missile testing, dismantling nuclear bomb testing sites, and promising not to pursue nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any response from the US for this," he said.
“Without relying on the U.S. in any way, there will be no confidence in our national security and in situations like this there is no way we can start unilateral disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about Washington's "step-by-step" approach to disarmament, under which North Korea will gradually benefit, his statement is clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left to one side only because Pyongyang has done so before.
At the first summit between U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Ri referred to the statement jointly made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which time Kim vowed to work towards "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first stop developing its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to end strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. has first emphasized disarmament and raised the level of pressure of sanctions so that it can forcefully achieve its objective, and at the same time, it has also objected to the “declaration of an end to the war,” Rei said.
"Resistance can tilt us, such an assumption is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that our confidence is only getting lower because of the constant restrictions.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, he said, adding that the U.S. leader spoke out about the United Nations' merits last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party for this disarmament problem is South Korea and the U.S. is not, then disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not be involved in such a stalemate.”
Still, Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he said of the U.N. National Assembly that it was inevitable to target U.S. mainland with a North Korean rocket after Trump called "Mr. Evil President" on a suicide mission.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, had praised Kim's courage to be picked up for disarmament but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he has no deadline set for this, “if it takes two years, three years or even five years – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have been arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the UN Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: “The Security Council’s sanctions must remain in place until without fail we realize that we are doing complete, last, and verifiable disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rei at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, with within just a few hours North Korea condemning them for "gangster-like demands."
At the Moon meeting this month, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts "compatible measures," it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
They reported that Kim had promised them "compatible measures" they were seeking a guarantee of security that Trump would take the pledge in Singapore and that they would move towards building normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses for a sufficiently relaxed job
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get as much rest as possible while fighting the growing macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
A teacher teaching the world’s number one university students often has no choice when it comes to the most common things to do to relax yourself.
Charles Kazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course for which he believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the effect of low sleep during teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
He told The Telegraph, ‘I had a girl come to me at the end of the year and she said: ‘Why do I say this every time I have to go to the next class next year?’
She told me that no one told her about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
When this course comes for the first time this year, students will know how important it is to have a good sleep habit in studies and athletic performance, besides this, it will also improve their general health.
Paul Berreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said students do not sleep enough every week, for which the university decided to start this course.
A series of interactive tasks has been included in the course that lasts for hours.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on the coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell what will be the effect on caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleeping time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
Professor Zesler said: “We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But, we believe they should be aware of this - just as smoking is aware of the health effects of smoking.
He said that while the culture of feeling proud of ‘reading all night long’ still exists, modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less which has become an increasing problem.
Making sure you sleep enough and sleep well is like a ‘secret weapon’ of the students, which can counter stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – it also protects against the impact on weight because the lack of sleep keeps his brain constantly thinking about hunger which makes him constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jesler build the course, completing his last-year class at Harvard during the past year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and motivated for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that all postgraduate students will be required to complete this course before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Jesler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before going to sleep, at the same time, they should also decide when to wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' emanating from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put a lot of circadian on them, causing sleep problems.
Livingston's 1 - 0 against Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard
The Rangers faced trouble in another match due to Dolly Menga's strike, with Livingston's 1-0 win put on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
The Ibro side was looking for their first win after a 4-1 win in the match played in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team provoked Gerard as the manager for the second defeat in 18 games to oust Landbrokes Premiership leader Hertz by eight points.
Menga struck for seven minutes before half-time and then the Rangers' line-up short didn't even get a chance to equalize the game.
However, the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place in the rankings, with Livingston reaching third place and only behind Hibernian because of the goal difference.
In addition, the game can be even more troublesome for the Rangers since the head wound of the Linsman Callum Spence has been treated since the object was clearly thrown at the other end.
The eight changes made to Gerard's side gave the last Ayer a chance to advance to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livy 11 that took a point of the Harts last week and the way they drilled well put the opposition team in trouble at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played much better than them.
When Menga first laid-off Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goal, he should have been given just two minutes, but the midfielder squandered the big chance he found.
When Keegan Jacobs in the deep did a free-kick, the kick went to captain Craig Hulkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo, who was on the back post, could only do the stabbing wide.
The Rangers got control, but in the final third, they had more than confidence in their game.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have put a penalty on the quarter-over mark because he and Steven Lawless had hit each other, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers saved two shots on target in the first-half, but former Eyebrow goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties from Lasana Kolibli's header and Twi Ovi Ezra's strike.
However, Livi's openers could have gone against the run-off game in the 34th minute, but no one can deny that they alone are entitled to this gift.
Even then, the best player in Rangers Deep could not be dismissed.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson kept Menga cool to pick up a simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Collibel for Ryan Kent and switched to show the effect immediately as soon as he was slotted by the winger in Morelos, he took a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line while running great.
However, Livingstone showed the visitor the same kind of game they could really enjoy, swiping the long ball with Lithgo and Lightweight after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have extended their lead, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from well-studied up before Lithgov widen the corner.
The Rangers called Glenn Middleton, who was present as an option, to make another late claim to the penalty as they were tangled with Jacobs, but Thomson did not let them succeed again.
Elmanac: Inventor of the Geyser Counter
Now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiser was born in Germany.
Geyser invented a device for detecting and measuring radioactivity that was later known as the Geyser counter.
Geyser Counter is a mainstay of science, it has become the mainstay of pop culture, plus, in 1950, a film on it became "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acting for the first time:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: “This is the geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After turning on these earphones, you can definitely hear the effect of atoms hiding because of the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Say, right now it's definitely popping!"
"Laughter" Geyser died in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
But because of his invention, his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine could ‘see’ the immune system’s damaged cells
The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ and eliminate the damaged cells of the immune system
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify damaged cells during treatment
Through this method, the immune cells of a patient can be removed and replaced in the laboratory
After that, they can ‘see’ the common protein for many cancers and then extract it and re-insert it
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in different types of cancer patients.
A woman was given the vaccine, which looked at her damaged cells in the immune system, then it was found that her ovarian cancer, which had been present for more than 18 months, had disappeared.
With this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be removed and replaced, so that they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then the cells can be removed and reinserted.
“Our results show that this vaccine is very promising,” said Professor J. Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prof Berzoofsky said HER2 causes "the development of many types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
Removing immune cells of patients and "instructing" them to detect cancer cells is beneficial in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's excellent performance, in which she praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would form the government in 2020, she condemned in the studio during Saturday's night live.
After performing her third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which she wore the Make America Great Cap, she denounced the Democrats and reiterated her support to Trump.
“So, I talk to white people a lot of times and they say: “What’s the reason you like Trump, they’re racist?”
Yet, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago.”
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's skit, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already investigating claims of sexual harassment made to him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like that was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not disclosed whether Rock was attempting to blow West's laugh with the posting due to the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that he was threatened by going to the backstage with his headwear.
"They threatened me backstage.
"""Don't go there wearing that hat,"" he said."
They threatened me!
He also said that I'm stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: “You want to see that wrong place?” At the same time, he said that they would “make drama for my Superman Cape, because it means that you can’t tell me what to do. The desire to move the world forward you keep?
Love it."
In his comments he mentioned the audience at least twice and SNL artists felt embarrassed, in a separate report one person told the publication: “The whole studio was completely silent.”
West was called in because of the delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande's old boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many viewers by performing on the song I Love It, she was dressed like a Periyar bottle.
West again met Candice Turner, head of the Conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous people: Thanks for raising the voice for the public.”
But, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is “just what she told and what is absolutely amazing.”
“But, I didn’t choose anyone who took advantage (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their “art”) who, according to me, is promoting the wrong idea for my community or calling my community wrong.”
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted on Twitter that he had changed his name, at the same time, saying that they were just "officially going to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but earlier Diddy and Puffy did the same, whose old names were Puff Diddy and P Diddy respectively.
Along with him was the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Lion and the late famous Prince of Music had also changed his name to the symbol and then the artist was already known as Prince.

The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington questions toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's Wild Middle Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying watching such roles on screen often motivates many young boys and feels it is important to do such a difficult job to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit revealed that he was feeling "something is wrong" and asked how to end the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married her Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who she believes feels ‘a lot of perseverance’ in talking about the problem.
"""Personally, I feel very strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong with masculinity?"""
Are we teaching men that when they are growing up, they have to deal with the problems they see on screen?
Kitt feels that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, thanks to its much more male-dominated character.
He said, “What is learning and what is being taught?
From what is taught on TV and on the street, young boys begin to believe that they should do certain things to be a man?
I think this has really become one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because it’s obvious that something has gone wrong with young men’s ideas.”
In an interview he also admitted that when the series of Game of Thrones comes again at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, at the same time, he also said that he has done a number of programs with 'wargrounds and horse riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on Sam Shepard's new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is Daku.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones is to meet his wife Rose.
“Through this show I got my life partner, so I believe this show has given me a family of my future and my life has moved on from here.”
Rose plays Yagrit, the girlfriend of John Snow, the character of Kit in the Emmy Award Winning Fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple got married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, the number of new cases in China has increased by 14%
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Given the recent changes, most of the new cases are attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV through this method had gone down to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex done by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that the LGBT community is quite discriminating against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Due to the many infections of the disease, these relationships have insufficient protection against sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which every person has been promised access to HIV medication.
Maxine Waters denied that her staff had leaked the GOP senator's data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy method".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters described the allegations as "unfortunate" on Saturday, saying one of her employees had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Lomacher's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were being investigated by the "ultra-right wing" pundits and the website.
Waters tweeted, "Lies, lies, and too much hate."
Reportedly, the information contained addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information was seen online on Thursday, posted by an unidentified man on Capitol Hill, when the Senate panel was hearing sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Questions were being raised on Kavanaugh over the leak of certain information of the three senators.
Hill says the address trick from conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState that identify the source of the person posting, was reported to have been linked to the Waters office and was issued by a Waters employee.
“This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false,” Waters said.
"None of my employees - whose identity, personal information, and security are being put at risk because of these false and false allegations - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information."
This allegation is baseless, totally false and absolutely false.”
Waters soon posted online to clean up criticism, including a former White House press secretary.
"The reason for this rejection is anger," Fletcher wrote.
"This shows that his nature is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When someone is accused, they should not do so in anger.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They must remain calm and be patient.”
It seemed that Fletcher was comparing Waters's response to Judge Kavanaugh's condemnation of Democrats, with critics accusing Kavanaugh of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also shared his thoughts on Twitter to defeat Waters in the midterm elections.
"If that's true, that's a big deal," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters pointed out that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and rule enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be told or not, and whether or not they will be held legally liable for all the acts they have done which are very bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees,” he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The act of spying by Rowan Atkinson was not considered to be too strong
From the British point of view, the importance of Brexit in any new film is still traditionally seen and it seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise that began with Johnny English in 2003 and brought it back in 2011 under the name Johnny English Reborn.
Will we self-destruct on the subject of how we certainly consider it a nonsense to speak on the nation’s new export opportunity?
Johnny English, a pop-oriented and rubber-faced unqualified at any rate, has his license to re-create something that is more famous than anything other than just his name, a massive comic creation for areas where English-speaking people live.
He is definitely a daft secret agent who managed to show Mr Bean a little bit of Dash Kluso in spite of his bizarre hypocrisy in the smoothie glamor and is a dolope for the chap who contributed a single note to the Chariot of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
They are basically travelers and are the International Man Atkinson of Mystery whose role in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except the Chaos of Wake.
In this new JE Outing, only one or two good scenes are seen.
I loved Johnny English enough to go into a helicopter wearing armored medieval suits and wrap the rotor blade on my helmet.
Doing physical comedy on screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but the laughter came very low and seemed oddly half-incomplete, especially with "excellent" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible presenting themselves as a component of comedy with complete confidence.
Laughter is like a comedy not for adults but for children, and Johnny English’s weird misunderstandings are not at all tolerable to me, and Bean is more like me in Atkinson’s Silent-Film.
The most important thing right now is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The UK's most secretive network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, identifying all of the UK's working agents on this network that could affect the agent's work - a tragic incident for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and deeply troubled Prime Minister, he is already grappling with a number of political and unpopular problems: this queasy-teresa-me character can be played well by Emma Thompson, but the script is not too strong to work on.
His intelligence advisers told him that every employee who has compromised with the spy will have to bring in someone who has retired.
In this way it means that Johnny English will have to fight by himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but what an undercover operative has to do is separate from the record on what it should be: it has some good comic stories, as well as, teaching English at the rock-type academy school by the detective.
English has been sent back to the emergency Whitehall for the briefing, and Ben Miller's re-appearing role has been combined with his much-loved back pained sidekick Buff.
Now that Boff is married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role being Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky has not been able to freeze Pepperdine.
Therefore, in her Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin make some very big mistakes when they face Olga Cruelenko's beautiful famme cracked Ophelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of getting into the talk of the Kersimetic tech billionaire who claims to have a solution to Britain's computer crises: the sinner Jason Volta played the role of Jake Lacey.
English and bog begin their Odyssey of the Fertial High-Ginx: working as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle through the expensive boat of Volta; and English fully activates the chaos when it tries to use a virtual keydetector to use the interior of Volta’s house.
The film has definitely been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but still it is fine and entertaining, there are a lot of fun things for kids throughout the film.
A good middle-class.
Moreover, as I have seen in other Johnny English films, in this film, I did not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really suits his talent.
Labour has denied that it plans to work only four days a week for the British people, but will receive the money in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a pro-democracy plan in which UK residents will have to work only four days a week - but the money will come in five days.
The party reportedly wants the owners of the company to give part of the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee three days of leave a week - but still they will be able to get the same pay.
Sources said such an idea would remain "excellent" with the party's economic agenda and it is a plan to benefit workers in the country.
The trade union congress is promoting a four-day shift in the week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party employee from The Sunday Times said: ‘Policy review, likely to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but is expected to take four-day work week, which is in line with the party’s overall industrial strategy as well as the party’s vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers.
With the Green Party pledging a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, at present, the Labour Party is not fully supporting this demand.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four-day work week is not the policy of the party and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to introduce his approach to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return power to utility firms from "faceless directors" and "profiteers".
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their entire stake back as the Labour government can "cut" on the basis of alleged wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on the company's boards and hand over 10 percent equity to private sector firms for employees who can receive annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes," reporter Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility of the FBI finding something that would change their minds.
Kennedy looked more outspoken than his South Carolina ally.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that while going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kaavana.
After that happened, when the charge came up, I called them, asked, 'Did you do that?'
Verily, he was a man of conviction, clear-headed.
However, Graham's vote, it seemed, was a stone's ridge.
"I made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied the obvious," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And what they called him, he could not verify.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert that features many highly influential stars performing, and equally impressive is its mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival will not only bring tens of thousands of people to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of the extreme poverty eradication program by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the International Support Group, the Global Poverty Project, which actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get free tickets to the event (except when you’re not ready to pay VIP tickets), those going to the concert will have to complete “actions” by becoming volunteers to help create awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty, emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through free concerts the right way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feel like they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing efforts towards various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion are already distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that the safe fund has had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, "helping children grow to their full potential."
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power for Nutrition during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on their website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.”
But, similar to the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Genelle Moni are one of the few performers performing at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to curb Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"The reason for their presence in the Middle East, I think, is that they want to harness energy, as they have done in the southern part of Europe, Eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that maritime routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, so as to ensure that their energy does not go into the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "Energy Consumer's Voice" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, "Economic options, more or less, in the case of Iran and Russia, are fuel-efficient and replacement."
The statement comes as the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump who, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "ban" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, “I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.”
The US stance was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry-leading organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kemf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have great trouble when a big state interferes with our energy supply."
Massachusetts Senator said Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the case of her joining the presidential race in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm election.
During the Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and that includes having a woman at the top,” he said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, saying, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh have been vocal in their criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “Of course we need to get the FBI checked before the vote.”
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think he should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, eighteen percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said the senator should not contest the election.
Thirty-two per cent supported contesting elections in this way.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick in his run-up to the election, where 38 percent supported a possible run-off and 48 percent were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that are likely to contest the election by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence case on Monday night
"Because of what my own son is going through after coming back, I feel sympathy for other families who feel the impact of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers come back," he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other retired soldiers, “They return with a slight change, they come back stiff, they come back wondering if this honor is for what their fellow soldiers and aircraft-drivers, and every other member of the military, have sacrificed for the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Vasilla Police Department, she was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence and drunk possession of a weapon.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang-raping or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a justice-friendly abstract Friday in Washington to support a refugee who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Government prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which generate a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the basis of particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and that such an obstruction violates that principle," he said.
The attorney further argued in the abstract that the policy denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to shelter victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, “A shelter is available for those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution or membership of their caste, religion, nationality or a particular social group.”
The refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
The number of those who die is double, and the number of those who die is double.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It seems extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who consoled the baby suffering from a bulwark at the exit center of the city of Tahas-Nahs Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their homes, picking up submerged goods, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and the hospital sank.
Some injured people, including Dwight Harris, who was facing a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors in the open due to frequent strong earthquake tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he felt the tremors of a violent earthquake in his fifth floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was overwhelmed by the wall collapse," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threats" through "promotional ads"
A week after running a four-page ad, by the state-run Chinese newspaper, referring to the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, China's U.S. ambassador to Beijing accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the U.S. press.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday - after China accused him of trying to interfere in congressional elections on November 6 - referred to China Daily's paid supplement in Iowa's top-selling newspaper - the Des Moines Register, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, U.S. officials told Reuters there was a new phase in Washington's push to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war that has seen them impose customs duties on each other’s imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that the first China retaliatory border-fees in the trade war were designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a long-time former Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad expressed his opinion in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, writing that China, “is now doubling that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press.”
"In its propaganda, by giving paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of freedom of speech and independent journalism," Branstad wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in a strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and no true reflection of the inconsistent opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic curve line of China," he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided an offer to publish his article on the pretext of publishing it", although he did not name the newspaper.
With Kaavana's defeat, Republicans are isolating women voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
Since top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment, the analyst has warned that they will see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings around it are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move on with the vote.
Those things can't go back on," Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reehr said he suspected that pressure at the last minute for an FBI investigation by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
On Friday, Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said: “Women can’t forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor November.”
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters in the Senate hallway shouted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to withdraw from the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But this could be more, especially doled out between the suburban female voters and the 18-to-29-year-old young voters who often don’t vote when the president doesn’t like it.”
Elaborating on the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there was a possibility of opposition if Republicans go ahead with the confirmation.
“This has become a confusing mess for the GOP,” said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the Cavna sitting on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they've treated them," Gai Cecil, director of Properties USA, an organization that helped Democrats win the election, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on what to believe in in the wake of Ford and Cavana's testimony, most of which favor Cavana.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in a certain or potentially cave.
Additionally, 38 percent said they felt Cavana had lied, perhaps or certainly, during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as, at least, another fiduciary, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took the oath of office last week and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee displayed her genitals when she joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new internet compared to Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information will be allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to gain "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to start a complete transformation, where all their business models will end up overnight."
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Von: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric Celebrated
The only pastor of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during the First World War was celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the September 29, 1918, attack on Bellingleize and Lehcourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his ships at a parade held in Rashden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the statue was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion in the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the midst of a very dense fog, under heavy artillery and machine guns on the battlefield."
They later moved to the firing line and, with "great gallantry," single-handedly toppled the military-line lead and three detachments before taking over the field-gun.
On October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather’s exploits were “something I know can never equal, but something we’re proud of.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also garlanded the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and that "the support being given by many is demonstrating the heroism of a real hero."
MMA fans kept waking up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the rough-hewn balter 206, but were deprived of watching the main event.
San Jose's bill had 13 matches, including six on the main card and was being shown live throughout the night on UK Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gagard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned by coverage's turn into Peppa Pig.
Some were extremely disappointed, especially after waking up early in the morning for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sickly joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator Senior Vice President Dave Schwartz said, “This content was not suitable for 6 a.m. according to government regulation, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"""Peppa the Pig, yes."
Scott Cooker, president of the Bellator company, said they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about replays, I think we'll probably find a solution," Cooker said.
"But there will then be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, there was a lot of text movement when this change took place and not all of them were favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But that was not the case, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six -- like we usually do -- and when we tried to deliver something more for the fans, it was a little too much.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Dessert Island Disc: Tom Deli felt 'indecisive' in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daily says he suffered from a debilitating feeling toward everyone because of his sexuality - but he was motivated by it to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daily said she didn’t realize until she reached secondary school that “everyone is not like me.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc, presented by Lauren Lavern, she said she talks about gay rights to give others "hopeful."
She also said that she was less concerned about winning the Olympics when she became a father.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Upon appearing as a socio-demographic figure at Laverne’s first event, Deli said she felt “deficient” in herself more than everyone else because it was “not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
She said: “Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he too is "scared," she said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze-medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke out openly because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without any trouble and wanted to “hope” others.
The three-time world champion said that a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - from when he fell in love - "I was surprised."
Deli married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than her, but she said age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a peer who went through the ups and downs of similar experiences at such a young age.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and the Daily said his "whole approach" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have all been related to 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are a lot more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
The Daily said his father did not acknowledge that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was whether he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, "I couldn't tell them you wouldn't be sitting in the front row, Dad."
He said, “When they were not able to breathe, I held their hand and held it until their breath was stopped and they were dead, and I thought they were not invincible. ”
The following year Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the swadeshi crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired her favorite first song - Proud By Heather Small - which resonated with her during her preparation for the Olympics and which she still stands out by listening to.
The Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikelson ruled out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when they play their 47th Ryder Cup match, but they will have to change their form to avoid it becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for the record for the 12th time, Mickelson was dropped from the game by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Foreballs and Forsam.
Instead of becoming the center of attraction, as he has often remained for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day living among the cheering crowd and working in the hope of improving the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never driving straight even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player hasn't been the ideal fit for the Tite Le Golf National Course, where those who aren't active for long periods of time are routinely punished for the wrong shots.
And while the course isn't that easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American players, who start with four points down in 12 singles matches, start strongly, then Mickelson's match can prove to be very important.
Fury confided in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, patted my back and circled me in their arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way we thought and the way we thought we had to move on.
He wants to go out there just like everybody else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's entertaining, he likes to make fun of people, and he has a special presence in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
Europe captain Thomas Byrne knows the big lead may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large lead in the last-day singles at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into uncomfortable moves.
Dane made his first appearance in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seave Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win, with the lowest margin, just reached the finish line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valdera; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valdera, we just managed to win," Bjorn said after seeing a 5-3 lead in the 2018 class Friday and 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that it’s not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have one goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus is to be.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players around the world - stand on the other side.”
Bjorn went on to explain how his players performed on the tough golf course: “In this I will never be able to surpass myself.
Tomorrow is a hard day.
Personal performances will come out tomorrow, and that’s a different thing.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you get out there in person, your potential as a golfer is fully tested.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players that tomorrow show your best.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he has to give his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite standing Jim Furyck would have been personally wishing for better performance for his players than what he did as a partner, with the exception being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had three points out of four.
Before facing defeat because of Europe’s “miracles in Medina” showing up, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furic himself has been at both ends of the reversal of those big final days.”
"I remember every beat of his," he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this momentum is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and incorporated people in a way that, as we felt, you know, we are trying to do some more miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the counter-attack with Rory McClello in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter are the other top half of the European order.
"I made these groups in this order because I think it covers everyone," Bjorn said of his single selections.
Germany's new war has been called off.
New warships of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-influenced Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, this will not happen until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Reinland-Pufflz," the flagship of the brand-new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships were ordered back by the Navy in 2007 to be brought in as a replacement for the time-influenced Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will feature an array of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology such as low radar, infrared and acoustic division.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art warships - which could allow Germany to build a power project abroad - will be timeless until the period of entry into service, Die Zhen commented.
The Dudley F125 battleship made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship after delivery to the ship's manufacturer.
Little was known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly significant as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Reinland-Puffels" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the value tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem of new warships, which have become particularly important in light of recent warnings, is fastening Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was actually “going to the end of the military-capable ships.”
The official said the issue has become serious over time as the old ships were removed from use but no replacement ships were made available.
He said none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is secretly listening to the secret lives of bats
The new research being carried out in an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of flying unique mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland, will follow normal and soprano pipistrals, as well as brown-haired long-eared and Dobnten bats settled in Weston Ross's Inverve Garden.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings shows the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
Then a natural-dwelling map and report will be prepared for illustration on a detailed scenario-scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural-dwelling management tasks such as building grasslands and how to keep woodlands well-maintained for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the last century
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the nesting of birds and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose a risk, as some chemical treatments of flypapers and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can become a hazard.
Cats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey because of their hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to point out defects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly survey, inspect bird bases and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Three Estates of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is a great place for him.
"We have a great area for bats here in Trive," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good natural habitats.
But there’s a lot about bats that’s still unknown, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand what they need to thrive.”
They emphasize the importance of checking bats before keeping them within the property because it is possible that inadvertently 400 females and infants could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternity detention facility, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, taunt or harass them or destroy their bases.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Farrell, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we still don’t know how their population is growing.”
Ronaldo dismissed claims of rape while lawyers sued German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape claims against him "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Dere Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video following the reporting of the claims, the 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "false news."
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
"What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name."
Its normal.
They want to be popular by taking my name, but that’s part of their job.
I'm a cheerful person and all is well," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, according to Reuters, whom he has called "suspicious invalid reporting in the field of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the players would "require compensation for moral damage in amounts consistent with the severity of the violation, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to the papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" whose "one percent" had disappointed him.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and even photographed her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "nervous with retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to terminate the agreement as she continues to be harassed since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Italian giant Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK to lose carmaker ‘will regret forever’
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Bernstone, near Derby, if Britain left the EU.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the border delay could have an impact on jobs.
The Bernstone plant - which makes Toyota's Orris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernstone.
Other UK carmakers have expressed apprehensions about leaving the EU without consensus on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to the risk of a supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with spares of made-to-order cars coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border disruption, according to industry, which could lead to delays and shortages of spares.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s Checkers’ plan for future relations with the EU was “calibrated purely to avoid those checks on the border.”
“We need a deal. We want a great deal that, in my view, can not only enjoy success in the present, but also what is needed to achieve this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only has there been evidence from Toyota but from other manufacturers that we should be able to fully continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would stop, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately lead to jobs being lost.
Peter Sauvallis, who has worked in Bernstone for 24 years and is the convenor of the Unite Union at the plant, said his members are highly concerned: “Once these jobs are gone, in my experience, they never come back later in Baid.”
An official spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "another week later" as the battle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the relationship between the Trump aide and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general, and that put Mueller’s freedom at risk, the news has warmed Washington’s rumored market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of putting a wire to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid the news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" removing Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of claims against Cavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “The date has not been set for this, it may be this week, I can see that all other cases going on with the Supreme Court may be pushed forward another week.”
But we’ll see and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some journalists have claimed that: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the TV reporters’ dislike of the “glory,” though he said: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they’re grand.”
She then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president conducts more Q&A sessions than any other president,” she said, not citing evidence: “We’ve seen those numbers.”
The briefing will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question directly to the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We try very hard to do that and you’ve seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he’s going to take the place of press talks.”
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House or attending open sessions or in a press conference with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated to the journalists present, perhaps by demonstrating his unrivalled presence on several occasions, and perhaps by demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about fears of Brexit
The health secretary wrote to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland, expressing the country's gratitude and wishing them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its degraded public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the mutual negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also pushing its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The EU, and colleagues beyond, bring together valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who suffered a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent an emergency surgery following a head injury, Tennessee Mike Organ said.
The head coach of the state of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel gave him oxygen on the sideline before placing him on the stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Aberdromy had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that "no details are available on the type/limit of the injury as of now" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury was caused.
Abercrombie, the redshirt sophomore, is in her first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He took a total of five tackles on Saturday before getting out of the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty to be levied from foreign buyers when buying property in UK
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged higher stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Enhanced stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Preparations are being made to charge a higher stamp duty rate on buying property in the UK from foreign buyers - the extra cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign that attracts young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional funding that will boost the government's campaign to tackle gold miners in difficult circumstances.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two homes and rental purchases started two years ago, can be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, leading to an increase in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy regions of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because there are more foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut with the intention of helping more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of grabbing land but not using it to push up property prices, and urged Mrs May to leave quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "habitual unemployment."
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the end of "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more authority to the councils for the construction of new houses.
Ms May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our fragmented housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it’s not true that it’s as easy for individuals not living in the UK as it is for foreign-based companies to buy homes for hard-working British residents.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become a far cry, and the fury of sleeping under the odd circumstances is extremely real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "last ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some stage.
Scott, 42, is reiterating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One, and who is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was all I had," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father since childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only if I succeed in club management.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel nervous about following established names in a big club that had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's initiative.
“For me right now, success can be gauged from whether I can return this club to the Premier League.”
Due to the structure and features of this club, it undoubtedly comes into the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I’ll probably see myself as successful here if I can get the club there.”
After spending 15 months as Dumbarton's assistant boss and 15 months in Harts' coaching staff, Ross's management career has been just three years.
They then helped Eloa recover from the third tier collapse, and replaced St. Mirren with the next season's championship title winners from the brink of collapse.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable now than they did during their careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academics.
In the case of Aloa taking over, he said, "This was probably the real crossroads."
"I really believed that management was a better fit for me than playing.
It seems odd because I did a fine job, earned a fair wage from it, and enjoyed some reasonably highs.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems to be fine in terms of management.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now that I’m doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The correct time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday, found in the survey
The summer solstice has fueled Britain's struggling pubs, but has put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The pub and bar group saw sales grow 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the statistics, said: “Compared to the persistent sunshine and England’s expected participation in the World Cup, July meant following similar patterns in the month of June last year, when pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that restaurants faced even more difficulties.
Restaurant trade declined by 1.8% in June to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars that sold wine performed the strongest with more choice than the restaurants.
Food-powered pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of all pubs and bars rose by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food prices fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM, said: “These results have continued the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events make up the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales, particularly due to ongoing cost pressures, would be painful.
The long summer season could not have been more of a bad time for food delivery operators, and time will tell if the higher average temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed relief.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new entrants, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slower pace in brand roll-out.
The COFER Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups performing with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account to show to parents
One in five children — some of whom are younger than 11 — are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean “main” account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found that a teenager in it was urging others to "bring me raped."
Research from independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s very disturbing that so many teenagers are lured into creating an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Ilyad Doyle will have a "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eileen Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who have guided the sport to benefit from its extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Ilyad has a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community and we are confident that bringing athletics to the board in Scotland will be of great benefit to him,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.”
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, Americans who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and who are now regular BBC pundits were unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I cant walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was grueling work, but learned to fully recover, walk again and practice agility today!
Thanks for the encouragement messages!”
Compared to mothers’ cows by breast pump advertising created differences in the opinion of people online
A breast pump company divided the opinion online by an ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-inspired ad, in which the new pump gives mothers the freedom to express themselves.
In a grassy barn full of cows, four real mothers dance to a song that includes some of the lyrics: “Yes, I suckle myself, but you don’t see any tails” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not churns, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Them Babys, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies."
Whatever the case, the advertisement, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from audiences, with many saying it lightly portrays the "fearlessness" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows for advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
Just like us they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that they are stolen from them within a few days after their babies are born," one wrote.
Elvie Breast Pump Fits Consciously Within The Nursing Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course it’s sad for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to have their children?"
Someone else added: "What an irrelevant ad."
Others defended the ad, one of which the woman said she found the ad’s song “laughing.”
"I think it's a very good idea.
I would have had it if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping gives me the experience of being a cow at all.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it just the way it is.
He said: "It's a great product."
Another commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who pump up (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like “cows.”
This is not a promotional or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they kept dancing by carefully pumping in their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvi pump is well hidden, does not have a wire or tube and fits directly into a nursing bra carefully, allowing women the freedom to move around without pumping, hold their babies and even go outside.
Anna Ballerin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvy Pump is a revolutionary product, entitled to a banging and spectacular launch.
By underlining the parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, showcasing the spirit of freedom in an entertaining and related way that will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time Elvi pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children who used the product appeared to be catwalking for designer Marta Jakobowski.
Hundreds of migrant children sneaked into a tent camp on the Texas border
The captured migrant children were spied on, even when there was no relative change in the monthly border crossings, to some extent because the rigidity and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to recruit children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves had employed undocumented immigrants and were afraid to risk their own ability to stay in the country by claiming any child ahead.
The threat escalated even further in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult or larger members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigrant authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, submitted evidence before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and the maximum number of them are criminals."
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Albans said.
Seeking to quickly prepare the children, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which children were required to appear in court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the asylum-seekers.
Many people appear through video conference calls instead of appearing in person to present their case for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to be released are immediately dismissed.
The longer the children remain in captivity, the more likely they are to remain restless or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts, according to the protection staff and the system’s report in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said that those cases are taken to a higher facility like Torniello, where the sign that the child is struggling is ignored because of their size.
At the same time, he said that taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to get emotionally ready or saying goodbye to friends would further exacerbate the shock that he is already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish forces to return immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulaym also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even when it was now the eighth year of war in the country.
Maulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign military forces illegally reside on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be treated accordingly."
"They should immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the war-land," he told the assembly.
He stressed that the "war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this “supernatural war” until we both cleared all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and “the presence of a foreigner.”
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on land in the country devastated by the war.
On the refugee case, Maulam said the circumstances were right for his return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading the fear of unemployment," which prompted the refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this withdrawal,” he said.
“They were politicizing a purely humane matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would receive no support for reconstruction unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United States politicians say that, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the stronghold of Idlib’s last major uprising creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement avoided a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where 300,000 people lived.
However, Moulum said the agreement contained a "clear timeline" and also hoped that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra Front, who would be "defeated."
United States Representative Stefan Di Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution to fix the path to Syria and the election.
Moulum placed certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, which said the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term in office
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are expecting any indictments and scandals to end his term prematurely.
No doubt "This will be the most dramatic closing of the national post ever!"
So far, there has been no visible fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of more than 1.7 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, and MSNBC's "The Resurgent Mado Show" ranked the highest in cable ratings by gaining 3.5 million viewers with major news broadcasts at night.
"It's a fire people are attracted to because it's not something we don't understand," said Neil Bayer, director of an ABC drama "Desegrated Survivor" that becomes president after being destroyed on the US House of Representatives in an attack.
Neal Scowell, an experienced comedy writer and creator of "Just the Funny Parts: And Hollywood Boys" has a different theory of some of the harsh truths hidden in the "club."
She recalls a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because they make me laugh,'" Ms. Scowell told me.
There was value to entertainment in the chaos.
Absolutely, on TV and beyond things, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the future of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only the privileged audience could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it’s beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself watching a six-hour debate by a panel of experts, using the root cause of Woodward’s “deep background” for his book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar bomber jacket (said the Washington Post’s “a thick cloth with hubris” description of Vitto’s character).
I'll never see Super Mario that way again.
Brent Montgomery, the creator of Wheelhouse Entertainment and “Pon Stars,” said “as part of everything he does, which makes it absolutely like a reality show where he brings something new to you every night,” which is a rotting cast of Trump’s show and a selection of everyday plot twists (N.F.L.), about any fights, Kim Jong-Koon.
You can't risk leaving a single episode or you'll be left behind.
When I went to meet Mr. Fleas this week, the northern edge of Kauai had a hot 80 degree temperature outside his house, but he was watching MSNBC recording CNN inside the house.
He was unable to distance himself from this, when Brett Cavanaugh was ready to face the future of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court hanging in Tarazu.
"I remember when we were doing all those silly or provocative shows in those days and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flaas told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but later found out they were right.”

In the run up to the election house, there was a flood of external money in the strong midterm
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, credit for the rebuilding of the Congress Mandal, which led to two office-bearers running for the same seat.
Which recently opened the front for Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamps were also involved in a second term race, Republican Cath Rothfuss, which currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, intersecting with the new 17th.
Following the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in January in the case of unconstitutional forgery in favor of Republicans by older districts, maps or maps were reworked.
In the new 17th race, the empty-handed fight between the major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) had touched the campaign's economy.
Lamb's name became popular in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory widely seen in the March special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That’s why that seat was held by Republicans for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
Political pundits provoked the democrats a little more.
U.S. punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance by Washington.
Mr. Trump held a passionate meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement that "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan" were made by state department officials to recall the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was fined, receiving an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow that aggregation or mobilisation similar to last year, which was seen as a further step in an effort to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end while considering any penalties or fines for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the conference in a sign of importing administrative positions at the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October.
And the three Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians who agree to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and also speaks on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case could be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible resistance to justice, of which there is now enough evidence in public records.
At the same time, Mr Mueller changes the direction of his investigation, according to the report, if Mr. Trump’s campaign aligns with Russia to attack our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body when they prepare themselves to go before voters again and perhaps in front of a jury of his colleagues.
That is, a lot of ifs and ifs, and I don't mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is not inevitable, nor his counterparts in Europe.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed by the West and supported by Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the massacre of so many years.
The functioning of the historical centre points around such separation points and the unrestricted march of democracy are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these separation points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentin, the man who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been embroiled in this dilemma ever since this paper reported it last year, he secretly suggested keeping the president's record and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times' account is not accurate.
"If the recently requested Brett Kavanaugh's F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite the proven allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we react?"
And beyond that, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will last until the long winter.
But I think because of the lessons I have learned in Prague, we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who had previously occupied my ambassadorial home as well.
She survived and settled in America, and after 60 years she sent me to a swastika-made table to burn the sabath candles.
As for my legacy with the same, how can I not be optimistic about my future?"

Graham Doran's Rangers Are Still Optimistic After Sharp Vienna Encounters
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, victory over the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dolan from appearing for the first time in the season to a 2-2 tie with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers could use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good thing for us because Villarreal was good,” the 31-year-old said.
"We moved into the game with the belief that we can achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can finally get to it, but overall, the draw will likely be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving towards Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game as they get good results with the crowd behind us in their previous game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and with the changes made to the club itself last year was definitely difficult but now it's a good experience in this space.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully now we can step back from our previous session and be successful.”
Women are losing their sleep for fear of this retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking to their family members about it.
More than half of individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You will not be able to prepare to care for your family if you do not tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your advisor and your family where and how to get care, as that option can be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor may also suggest you on ways to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-price life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so you hire a trusted person to look after your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, the professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider the right of attorney to inspect your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little information: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer their medications and allergy-related questions?
Write that information in a written plan, so that you are ready.
“It’s not just a financial role, but who’s the doctor?” asked Martin.
"What medications are given?"
Who will take care of the dog?

A man shot several times in the air in Lafayette.
A man was shot several times from the air rifle when he was on his way home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in Devon's Oxford Grove area when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials describe the shooting of the BST at around 02:30 a.m. as an "accidental incident."
The victim could not see her attacker.
His wounds were not so deep, so the police appealed to him to be a witness.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed and the death toll was expected to rise on Friday following a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city.
When communication was shut down, rescue officials were unable to get any information from the Dongala Regency, the northern region of Palu which is near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated in the ravages.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the shores of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency on the beach northwest of Sulawesi Island, which is spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, up from 200 in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy of the central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morowli on the opposite coasts of maximum Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, a tsunami has hit Palu and Dongala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit western Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from a seismic point of view and regularly suffers earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, half of whom were in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggered a 6.8-magnitude tsunami that rocked the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang affected the region, which is the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the region off Mentawai Island off the coast of Sumatra, destroying dozens of villages and killing nearly 300 people in a tsunami that covered an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A shallow-water earthquake in AK strikes the victim Jaya Regency, causing destruction and stampede as it caused people to remember the devastation or devastation of the 2004 Great Earthquake and Tsunami.
There were no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people were killed when buildings or buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes devastated everything on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and rendered thousands of tourists helpless for some time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Pelin, the eldest son of Eastern Alaska ruler and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Pelin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Pelin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, on suspicion of tampering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he used to take the phone from her.
According to the KTUU report, Pelin was sent back to the Maut-Su pretrial facility as well as fined an unsecured bond of $500.
The network reported that he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for the plea.
Pelin faced three A-class offenders, where he could be sentenced to up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father, Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Pelin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the court of experienced persons in Alaska.
In January 2016, she was charged with obstructing reports of domestic violence, domestic violence, and possessing a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her in the face.
After linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
With the death rate rising in the coming days, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The quake struck central Sulawesi, the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact were circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered in the city of Palu for the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspect of the NYC attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a rare death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack on New York City that killed eight people—a rare punishment given in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Cypov, 30, reportedly uses a home depot rental truck to attack pedestrians and cyclists by bike on the way down the western-facing highway in Manhattan in October, cutting off pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has “deliberately” killed eight victims and “deliberately” physically wounded them, according to information of the intention to seek the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York.
These two countries impose a possible death penalty according to the court document.
A week after the invasion, a federal grand jury struck Saipov with a whip for 22 charges, including eight murder charges for aiding racketeering, which are used exclusively by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "adequate planning and prior deliberation," explaining the manner in which Saipov carried out it in a "disgusting, cruel and vicious" manner.
“Safulao Haibibulvic Saipov has injured and damaged the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cl<0xC3><0xA9>vus Enl<0xC3><0xA9>r<0xC3><0xA8>re Dicat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allerge, Hern<0xC3><0xA9>e Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xB3>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagunco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The trial of a previous death penalty case in New York's South District has been going on for a decade.
Khalid Bren was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in the New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953 was a married couple who were found guilty of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Joanne Rosenberg was executed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Saipov did not have any glans or regrets for days and months after the invasion, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he liked what he did.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired to attack after watching ISIS videos of the crime on his phone.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count offence himself.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who says they are "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released would only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include all of them," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be made responsible for Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "collect an army of people" during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Euripides leader asked politicians from Eurosceptics to ‘understand the weather’ – because one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested she should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told March in Birmingham that if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'outplayed' by now.
But the challenges Mrs May faces in addressing her highly divided ranks have been highlighted by Pro-Remain Tory to add a different protest against Brexit to the city.
Premier is struggling to keep his checker's settlement plan on track during attacks from Brexiteers, reminders and the EU.
The allies urged that she would attempt to strike a deal with Brussel instead of backlash - and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr Bone said leaving meant leaving the rally in Solihal, where he wanted to 'fank the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraaz should be made a partner and he should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussel.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by now," she said.
Wellingborough MP or MP said: I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.
Setting its opposition in the European Union, he said: 'We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bone rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their views and they want to stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkin also said in March: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent between our party and our workers who actually surround the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.”
In a focused message to Smt. In , she said: The Prime Minister keeps his jobs when he does not break his promises.
Mr Faraz said the rally leaders should be made 'realised' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes," he said.
‘They’re trying to cheat Brexit and today we’re here to tell them ‘we won’t let you run away by doing that.’
In a message to the cheering crowd, he said: "I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit by understanding the atmosphere.
"""We are organizing an army of people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and who do not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom,"" he said."
Meanwhile, the Remeners march from Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A group of activists pointed to the Tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Edwinis pretends to have a conversation about security issues with the app when the conference opens.
"It's those people who tell us that they can have the proper IT system and all the technology for Canada, the non-resistance border, and the borderless free trade in Ireland."
"It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to adopt a 'strict view' on the president's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close watch on the president's operations" following the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that during the town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat or Democrat talked about his future.
A regular critic of President Donald Trump, Warren GOP is in the race for re-election in the state's prestigious Geoff DeHale November, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were being speculated that they could replace Trump in 2020.
It was Trump's 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since he took office at the Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke.
One of the attendees asked if he was going to join the presidential race.
Warren replied that it was “time for women to go and fix our broken-hearted government and include women first.”
LSU surrendered in the death of Sim.
Police in Betten disease, L.A., announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim was arrested on Friday.
The Betten Disease Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man he saw in the footage.
Sim, 20, was shot dead near the campus of South University on Friday morning.
"Police Chief Murphy G. Paul told Sport per 247 on Saturday that "he died as a result of a bullet to the head of Wade Sim."
Wade went on to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
When Simpson was asked, he admitted to killing the mad sim with a weapon there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
A 6-by 6-foot junior, who grew up in Betten disease, played 32 games with 10 starts in the previous season in the Sims and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ends world title after team's victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas is qualified to play a major role in the Louis Hamilton Mercedes" team order race on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and kicked Hamilton out as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vatel to create a hurdle in his team's drivers.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was behind a lap and came out from behind Vettel but Hamilton stepped forward after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari's driver reluctantly defend on the third corner, leaving without any risk after a double-move.
Max Verstepan started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a larger part of the race when he focused on changing his tires and quickly surpassed Kimi Rakonen in fourth place.
He finally came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, when Reconne took fourth place.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri did a great job all weekend and is a really great gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly by getting one-two, Hamilton said.
It was a really bad feeling
President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dine Feinstein at his request, not leaking Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
While speaking at a rally in Western Virginia, the president did not directly address the statement letter given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current situation in the Senate, saying that people are "meant and evil and dishonest."
"A very good thing or thing that can happen in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do that.'
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Ding Dong, did you get the hang of it?
His answer is remembered... Did you leak the document — “Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he said, pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter back in July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that it had been leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she told me."
But the president did not find his rejection justified, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "Let me tell you it was really a very bad gesture.
Maybe he didn't, but I've probably never seen such a bad attitude before."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, the three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct, the President pointed out that the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to take the power back by any necessary means.
You see their meanness, dirt, and at the same time they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to get power or power or control," the mediator reported to the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dever scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars won a 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday to compensate for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants.
Giants initially got two goal lead through attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowne Dior brought the home side level up before Giant's lead was reinstated.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Boschhardt equalized for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nelson secured the win by two goals.
It was Adam Keefe's third Elite defeat of the season for the man who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giants winning the last three games, it was the fourth meeting of the season on the sides.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford helping Beauvier double the lead in the subsequent four minutes.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt's equalized with the Couney at 15:16.
Dwyer ensures that the Giants take the lead in the first break until he gets his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side is grouped again and Boshard once again brings them to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Couney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nelson lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and ensured their team's only win in the fifth halfway in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost their last five games so far, are now set to play their next game on Friday at their home ground in Milton Kane.
The air traffic controller was killed in ensuring that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller is hailed as a hero or hero in Indonesia since he was killed in ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people could land safely on the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and many more missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi activating a tsunami on Friday.
The subsequent trauma in the area continued to destroy and many people were trapped under the debris in the city of Palu.
But while his aides were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunwan Egang refused to leave his post, which was too busy to be controlled at the airport, at the airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, landed safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, when he thought it was about to fall.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirtrett, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take them to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, we lost them even before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken by his departure," she said.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands with the destruction of the country, with the demilitarization agency saying access to Dongala, Sigi and Botonsh is limited.
"The death rate could still rise as many bodies could still be buried in remains or debris, or in many places that could not be reached," said Sutopo Nugroho, an agency spokesman.
Waves up to six meters high destroyed the Palu, which led to the mass burial on Sunday.
Army and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances used to bring dead bodies.
Access to clean water is rare.
Small markets were looted everywhere."
The head of the International Red Cross, Jane Galfand, told CNN: "Indonesia is running the race to help Red Cross biologists, but we don't know what they'll find there."
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation."
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was the first to witness an earthquake in Lobunk earlier this year, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reveals that a man has been missing since the Lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operates the crashed plane in the Pacific Lagoon in Macronesia, now says one man is missing, after it was reported last time 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niyugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at the missed island airport, local boats helped to rescue other passengers and crew.
Seven people were taken to hospital on Friday, officials said.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are stable now.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which the incident took place is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the two planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jane said the plane had fallen too low.
"It's a very good thing," Jane said.
Jane said she and others were pulled out of the deep water from the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the plane's personnel were panicked and screaming and suffered a minor injury on the head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped rescue people by using an air boat to bring them to shore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of the PNG-registered airline over the past two decades but none were involved in the air nebulae.
Analysts told the time of the night when the woman was burnt alive
Prosecutors on Saturday reinstated their case to re-trial a man on charges of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rollett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she may have used cellphone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rolett said he received location data from several cellphones, which show he was with Talis Chambers on the evening of his death while refuting his previous claims, The Clarion-Laser reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cellphone was near the chambers at the time, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented further evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Taliesin was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because his truck was in Nashville.”
The second inconsistency was that Talis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rollett said that shortly after the chamber's death, Talleys had removed all of the chamber's text messages, calls, or contact information from his phone.
He said, “She took him out of her life.”
The defense is set to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury for hearing that day.
High Breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
The trio of hip hop want to change the negative view of the genre by filling in the positive messages in their music.
High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has been roped from its roots to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and reawaken the popular hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common saw a latest resurgence in the UK through artists like Alaka and Loki.
The second black person?!
NY nanny sues couple after firing after "caste" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for biased targeting after a mother complains that she is "the other black person" after making misleading text.
The couple denies that they are the racist, prosecuting for "abduction."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, on discovering that the new baby-carrier Gisele expresses her Bacchanal to Maurice, who was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman said to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, it sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing her mistake, an "incompetent" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that her outgoing nanny who was African-American had done poorly and that she was hoping for a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Uber by paying her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands the couple's removal from the job and compensation of $350 per day for six months, in a live-in gig he was however hired to start work without a contract.
“Look, I want to show them that you don’t do such a thing,” she said in a post on Friday, explaining that “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple said on the claims that they were racist, stating that they couldn’t trust him after insulting him, it was appropriate to end Morris’ employment.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't mean.
He is not a casteist.
We're not racist people," husband Joe Plasco told the Post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you’ve ever insulted, even if it was a mistake?
"Your new baby?
Also leave."
Like the lawsuit for "abduction," Plasco said his wife had only had two months to have a baby and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
"Are you following someone like that?"
It is not right to do so," said the investment banker.
While the legal lawsuit is still ongoing, there has been a quick response to the accusation of the couple on social media, keeping them silent for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers fear the reader will not associate it with their own ideas and opinions, the new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: “It’s hard to think of putting someone in their place when reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It's amazing to know about the success of pandington."
Describing his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a small bear toy, he was optimistic about the rejection of his work, saying he had both "happiness and loss" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of her family”, she states that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not arrogant at all," she said.
"But because Pondington was so real to them, it was almost like you have a kid who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not actually doing it."
I think they've seen Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his imagination and composition, he always credited Paddington for it.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors went in vain.
"Naid was regularly saying it was really bad, not expecting it to be like that," Mrs. Adnan-Laparus said.
"Naid then called me and told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors had given her to beat her heart was slowly leaving her system.
She would have died some time ago and all this would have stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was going to end.
I couldn’t do anything to scream, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by people in my family.
I had to take care of everybody."
Eventually Mrs. Edn<0xC3><0xA9>n-Laparus, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - who were unaware of what situation they were going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I put my head down and the tears were flowing all the time.
It was difficult to express, but I found a feeling of extreme sympathy for Nade in the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of victims to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones due to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he was suffering from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising chef who used to spread his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always used to say that his smile can light up everywhere.”
However he had quit work before he died and he lived in a “very dark room.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother who at the time was searching for his lost brother or sister at the age of 11 committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect.”
Ms. Davis made the card, “To let people know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.”
Don’t sit still – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphries, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we will make some changes in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he could not get an eye on them."
She said her death was a big shock to her, but she had to get out of it: "It ripped the family inside out.
It made us sad.
But we all had to fight ahead.”

The future of Kavanaugh was hanging in the balance when the FBI began its investigation.
“I thought, if I could really find something that he’s searching for – a limited time and a limited scope investigation – maybe we could bring a little unity,” Mr Fleck said on Saturday as well as he feared the committee was “breaking down” between the alleged partisan gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It was because of their lack of time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 – as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so they would severely undermine their efforts in the high court they wanted to win on the ground.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the senator, promotes him to support Mr. Kuwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate will vote, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's unclear whether Mr Kuwangua could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, vice president, had to do by terminating it and confirming it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'refugees' have been 'broken' by Kim
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea decreased when John-Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the South's unification ministry, Park Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>-Siog said 1,127 people had fled their duties last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and extortionists were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
A large number of fugitives from the North are eventually proposed South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum China fled, with the longest border with North Korea and it is easy to cross the reliably protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still technically in a state of war - has seen an improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on blocking nuclear disarmament talks.
It became active after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed to the terms of working toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will have no choice but to harm ourselves unilaterally first," Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "fun", saying he is not qualified for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "fun" and said he was unqualified by nature to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't imagine a woman performing like that, they call it "fun," Pelosi said Thursday, reacting to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kawangua emotionally denied allegations that she had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes yelling and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He clearly punished the Democrats on the committee by falsifying them the allegations of "vicious and coordinated character assassination" by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton for losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh's witnesses had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was acting against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted if Kavanaugh would become permanent if asked, and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, would she still blame Kavanaugh?
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fair to the Supreme Court, but being invited he can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kawangua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rules against the act or Roe v. Wade's affordable care because he is known to do conservative justice.
In the course of his certification, Kawangua deferred questions about whether it would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh deferred questions on whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
And women need to move it.
It’s a religious objection, months and years of anger go out and she can’t stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stamin told me 45 years later that “when we cry, we get angry.”
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
"A woman who helped me a lot who works for an officer somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she has developed a new technology, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you feel like I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to pour out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An early job, one of my scariest memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, found an old woman holding my neck from behind—a sharp manager I’d always been a little scared of—that dragged me up the stairs.
He said, "Don't cry in front of anyone."
"They don't know how tough you are.
They think you 're sad and you' ll be glad to meet them. "
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat or name called Monkey Business, making a connection with someone other than the marriage and withdrew his name from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was highly disappointed, decided to run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thought-provoking decision,” she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was delayed, she didn’t have time to raise funds and so she swore that she wouldn’t run in the race until she collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I've got a discount?" he wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she couldn't control the emotions - thanks to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made her difficult to raise money and even frustration and anger over sexism from the target voters rather than representatives - she began to suffocate.

How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the trade war between the US and China was about to slow and while the war is far from over, the rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by imposing major Chinese export taxes, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week with new tariffs affecting items up to $200 billion (150 billion pounds) is effectively taxing all of the more than half of the goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing has resisted its own way every time, the most recent five to 10 percent slapping tariffs of $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to burst soon.
Getting Washington back means hollowing out the demands, but tilting the head in front of the U.S. publicly would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say Beijing could make its move, with the U.S. trade war positively supporting China over the long term while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that either trigger economic telespins in the country is actually even more dangerous than previously observed by the audience,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center for New America Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulam said the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress made today against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the circumstances now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maulam said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Journey's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at the Par 3 16th hole by accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds by becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since starting the tournament's current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the European team's lowest-ranked player, Denmark's Thorbzon Olsen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Lan Poulter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It has been a difficult year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have the cup back.
It’s about the team. . . and I’m so glad I was able to help,” said Gracia emotionally after Europe’s victory.
She hammered her partner John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Wood 2 and 1 in a single play on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Wood, I’ve grown up watching him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time has won 14 major titles only second only to Jack Nichols.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find Fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finlayau, who played golf with the entire Caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
In the morning, we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
Hes a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We’ll regroup, I’ll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move on with Thomas.
I love these 12 boys so much and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to greet them.
We played better."
