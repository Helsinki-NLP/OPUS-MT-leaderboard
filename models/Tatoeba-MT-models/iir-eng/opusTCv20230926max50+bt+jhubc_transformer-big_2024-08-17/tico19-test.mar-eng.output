The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom is growing rapidly between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases are showing similar patterns in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom, confirming that even though the stages vary by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across the country.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and in-depth medical centers must ramp up their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care and, in particular, over-the-counter treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cytoplasm were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified a new coronavirus as a pathological medium, now known as the acute severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
So far, evidence has shown that 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e., respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 takes the form of a more serious disease that has to be hospitalized, while in the remaining 6% cases, the disease becomes severe which requires in-depth treatment.
The mortality rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In these studies, we evaluated the nature of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with the Hubei province of China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with cases in Italy between 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19 and the figures of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following the situation in this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al's March 5 publication suggested the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases returned from Wuhan in China's Hubei province were reported by France on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, including 31 December 2019 and that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The number of COVID-19 cases and the number of confirmed cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases from every country in the world, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 a.m. using official sources such as the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the extent of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative cases of COVID-19 cases for 14 days, taking into account the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 a.m. on 15th March 2020 and compared them with the cases in Italy for the period 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The overall nature of the 14-day divided cumulative cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is similar to that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, in the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then began to increase rapidly as of February 28, 2020.
This included a significant increase in reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK, with an increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 (supplementary content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
It highlighted that the number of cases in Italy in the last three weeks or less was already reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK at 8 a.m. on March 15.
Our results show that cases of COVID-19 are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed nature of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is growing comparatively rapidly in all countries.
In addition, while different countries are at different stages, gaps in national public health responses and possible definitions of different cases in countries and different protocols of patient selection must be checked for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a condition that required hypertensive therapy for 10% of patients suffering from COVID-19, and media sources have indicated that hospitals and ICUs in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals and/or ICUs is currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to compile the current monitoring data in a systemic manner consistent with that will focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there is a huge gap in the number of intensive medical and middle medical beds in Europe, which is 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that Italy has fewer or more resources than other countries (12.5 intensive care and middle-care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK is related to the sample situation related to the saturation of the health care capacity This is associated with a <0x3E>90% risk of exceeding the in-depth medical laying capacity, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since cases are still limited to certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care centers are providing treatment to a certain regional population, information on cases and hypertensive care centers should be made available within the definition of regional centers for the Level 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The country, hospitals and ICUs, therefore, need to prepare themselves for the continued community infection status of SARS-CoV-2 and for the increasing number of COVID-19 infected patients who will need to maintain health care and, in particular, emergency medical care, such as those in the affected regions of Italy.
A quick, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to prevent delays in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, as rapid expected growth in such cases will not allow decision-makers and hospitals to assess, accept and absorb their response.
Public health measures have also been listed in a rapid risk assessment to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can further ramp up their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a wave of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been caused by the acute severe respiratory disease (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world and has become a disaster for mankind.
SARS-CoV-2, which caused SARS-CoV in 2003 to infect thousands of people, may have been infected by bats and exhibit similar symptoms through similar techniques.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, but the infection rate is higher and older than young people and older men than women.
This article seeks to provide a timely and inclusive review of the research topic that is evolving in response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease.
We have dealt with the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and nail down this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese who were asked to stay at home for the entire holidays and for many weeks thereafter due to the outbreak of the new infectious disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003, so on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization renamed it SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has affected 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and perhaps even more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7 January 2020, which has led to a definitive sequence of the virus in addition to various patients.
This review seeks to summarize research progress in new and progressively evolving subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, Middle East Respiratory Disease (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as the urgent issues that remain.
CoVs have traditionally been thought to be life-threatening pathogens for humans, leading to about 15% of colds.
However, in this century, we have faced two deadly human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and quickly spread to other countries with a deadly outbreak and death.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of pneumonia with unknown origin were first reported by the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The order of CoV was issued after seven days.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, health care providers were reported to have been infected, which showed that human-to-human transmission could occur.
On January 23, a complete lockdown was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was closed.
The first medical study on the disease on January 24 indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that had been treated as an early infection center from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and in 50 countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final status and severity of the outbreak is still uncertain.
A multi-centre study on 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of 11 February 2020 has presented the updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but primarily targets people in the 30-65 age group.
Half of the infected people (47.7%) were 50 years of age, even less than 20 years old, and only 14 infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/1,00,000) more than women (0.27/1,00,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly to Hubei and surrounding cities.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average period from infection to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased enormously before January 23, 2020, which coincided with the large outbreak ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among patients with fixed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and that of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0x3E>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses that include a single thread of sensor RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
This covering spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then causes skin fusion.
Infectious RNA genomes are released into the musculoskeletal cell; after the virus replicates the genome, the genomic RNA forms a virion-joint vessel with the overlapping glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then amalgamated with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new type of beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequenced samples taken from the origin centre of the outbreak at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in very thin areas of the human aerosol.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more debilitatingly than the S protein of SARS-CoV, which in turn causes less severe infection due to SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new short proteins, which are encoded by orf3b and the secreted protein is encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in infectious pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFN<0xC3><0x9F>; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or purpose.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., indicated that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution has been mixed with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex structures that were open and closed were amalgamated as demers, and ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to two S proteins, which provide evidence of identification and infection of the CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Original and Medium Host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted from feral cats and camels to humans, respectively.
After a historical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the local host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to bat-bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is unknown which medium carriers helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the route of infection is yet to be clear.
Ji, et al., has suggested that snakes must be carriers in order to reach humans from bats, in which there must have been a homosexual recombination during the S protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that the long nose, ant-eating eating cat, which is used in traditional medicine in China, may be a potential medium host of SARS-CoV-2, for which 99% genetic similarity has been found in the CoV found in the feeding cat and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% gap split between the two genomes is still a big gap, so solid evidence is waiting for a conclusive conclusion (Fig. 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can survive up to 5 days at 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot be detected in ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 <0xC2><0xB0> C after 30 minutes, except for ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, paracetamic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine, other primal solvents can effectively neutralize it.
In general, the entire human race cannot cope with SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when the virus attacks the host, it is first identified by pattern recombination receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-lye receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors.
The virus through different pathways induces the expression of flammable elements, maturation of dendritic cells and type I interferons (INNs), which limit the spread of the virus and increase the speed of macrophage fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, N-protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from immune response.
Soon, favorable immune responses join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in the defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit cell function by involving the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes components and antibodies such as C3A and C5A, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, the antibodies extracted from the recovered patient have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's overactive response largely results in the emergence of locally free cell groups that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in bad conditions cause various organs to deteriorate and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection that begins in the group is most likely to occur in older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
People who have other diseases or whose immune system is weakened are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most cases detected in 3-7 days, such as the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and was between 0 and 24 days.
As described above, a very recent study shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days in a population of 8,866 cases.
Combining the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period is very important for healthcare authorities to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general measure, people who have come in contact with the virus or who have been infected will most likely need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is it necessary to quarantine for 24 days?
Fever is a major and early symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, runny nose, muscle stiffness, nausea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the illness.
In severe cases, patients immediately develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
The virus must be examined for early diagnosis of patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even if there is pulmonary imaging abnormality.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were as follows: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55% and diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were also found in two recent studies on a family group and a group infected by a person with no symptoms.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients, and MERS was more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
As of 14 February, when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 in the world, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%.
In comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study in June 2012.
Earlier studies had indicated that SARS-CoV-2 had a high RO of 6.47 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV had a RO between 2 and 4.
In terms of symptoms, mortality and RO, SARS-CoV-2 is compared with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, it is much more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Collective beginnings often begin in a single family or start from a single ceremony or from a single vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have had contact with infected persons or within the last two weeks prior to commencement.
However, it has been suggested that people can hold the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients who have been discharged from the hospital can re-carry the virus which has prompted a warning to extend the quarantine period.
The normal or decreasing number of patients at the initial stage consists of peripheral sucrose (particularly lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with elevated blood cell count, including <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L lymphocyte count, and advanced aminotransferase levels and viremia.
The level of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin had increased in the blood of some patients and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte layer had increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the production of fibroin degradation in the blood had increased the level of de-diamer and the lymphocyte count had decreased rapidly.
In most COVID-19 patients, abnormalities were found in chest radiography and are characterized by a bilateral patchy shadose or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop conditional pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive abscess strongly affects the air exchange.
A breakdown in type-1 and type-2 pneumocytes reduces surface levels and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability to transmit lungs and increasing the risk of lung deterioration.
Therefore, the worst radiographic findings are often the most serious diseases.
The first diagnostic assessment of COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed that the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of disinfectant membranes and the intrusion of central lymphocytes and the lung of a patient who died of the disease is consistent with and consistent with the multinucleated synthesical cell viral infection prognosis and ARDS.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcryptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, the high false-negative rate of the pandemic has led to the use of medical disclosures for diagnosis in China on February 13, 2020 (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation had arisen with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, medical disclosure, laboratory tests, and radiological findings are important and essential in making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to identify SARS-CoV-2, using a dipstick that contains 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10 mol/L per 100 ml/L of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibers, within an hour without the need for extensive tools.
It is hoped that if verified in medical samples, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Since there is a lack of experience regarding the new CoV, physicians can only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients and can look at other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2) using a variety of treatment methods previously used or proposed.
These treatment methods include current and potential treatments including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and mental support.
Not only this, the cells of the recovered patients were also proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are making rapid efforts to produce antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys to some extent.
Thus, failure and malfunction of the respiratory system poses a major risk to patients and is the leading cause of death.
Therefore, it is necessary to support the respiratory system to get relief from symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen treatment, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technology that is used for fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
It is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent secondary infection and septic shock, and protect the functioning of the major organs, treatment and management.
It has been found that the additional response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients results in a cytokine storm.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response that appears due to the release of a series of cytokines that include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals which are the major cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody corticosteroids and tocilizumab are used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include T cell-guided immune response, IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, lintomomab, cytokine signaling 4 suppressors and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially vascular osteoarthritis, which can significantly affect prognosis.
However, short treatment of corticosteroids in small to medium doses is being recommended for thought use in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Till the time of writing this, no effective antiviral treatment was confirmed.
However, an American patient suffering from COVID-19 has been found to be effective after being given a remdesivir through a vein.
Remdesivir is a unique antiviral drug developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlberg virus.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential resistance to other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on this, Gilead provided these factors to China to conduct trials on patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2, and the findings were very promising.
In addition, barycetNB, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms.
Combining treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
The blood of a patient recovered from infectious diseases has a long history behind the collection of blood to treat patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting sick.
It is true that the blood of recovered patients has a higher number of antibodies than that of pathologists.
Antibodies to fight with pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) that are produced by B lymphocytes, and they recognize specific molecules in pathogens and destroy them directly.
On this basis, cells were collected from the blood of the patient group recovered from COVID-19 and 10 patients who were seriously ill were immunized.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as reduced inflammation and virus pressure, and improved blood circulation.
However, widespread use requires verification and clarification unless specific treatment methods are developed.
At the same time, it is necessary to carefully consider some of the disadvantages associated with the cells for therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening in nature.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells is high to treat a seriously ill patient.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or to examine effective antibodies against the virus's essential proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies rapidly.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effect is largely dependent on the combination of different components of the formula according to the diagnosis of the disease according to the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective factors are unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to remove and verify such factors or their highest combination.
As there is currently a lack of effective and specific treatment regimen for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from severe stages.
For example, Xu Feng Jie Du Capsules and Lian Hua King Ven Capsule have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
Among the 87% of patients using TCM for the treatment of COVID-19, China's various provinces with higher recovery rates included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province with only 30% of COVID-19 patients using TCM showed the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rough comparison because other impact factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) only with the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the body temperature was much lower in the WM<0x2B> TCM group than in the WM group alone, the duration of the onset of symptoms and hospitalization.
Most importantly, the symptomatic growth rate (mild to severe) was much lower in WM<0x2B>TCM than in WM group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in WM<0x2B>TCM group was also lower than in WM group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, large-scale controlled trials for the efficacy and safety of TCM need to be carried out in more centres.
It would be somewhat strange to characterize the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatment or their combination, if possible.
Patients suffering from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience a highly contagious or lethal disease, and people in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Also, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to anxiety and mental depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, emotional disorders such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic stimuli, virulent symptoms, delusions and feelings of suicide were reported.
Compulsory follow-up and quarantine as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more concerned about infection, isolation, and guilt in family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and those in contact with them, as well as to the general public in need.
Mental support includes setting up of multidisciplinary mental health groups, accurate news and treatment plans regarding the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, use of commercial electrical devices and use of applications to avoid close contact with others.
An effective vaccine is needed to break the chain of transmission from animal to virus stockpiles and susceptible hosts to infected humans, and it can also be often used for anti-virus treatment to control the emerging virus pandemic.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Efforts are being made to develop a protein-based vaccine to generate long-term and qualitative antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-weakened vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, the physical efficacy of the vaccine among the candidates who were given the vaccine prior to the commencement of clinical studies and the protective factors against the deadly challenge of the sample and the animal-borne virus infection in the adult population are yet to be ascertained.
The reason for this may be that the effect of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the contrary, some of the sporadic cases and some mass cases of MERS originated in the eastern countries and continue to spread to other regions, which shows that animal-spreading sources exist in the epidemic region.
Vaccination strategies for MERS were developed using neutral viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microbes, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune persons is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the hurdles is challenging because a long-term (average 18 months) is necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic diversity of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has started showing its full medical order in thousands of patients right now.
In most cases, the patient can recover without any recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare institutions need to set up diagnostic models to prioritize their services, especially in resource - free areas.
The following factors may or may be related to or affect the prognosis of COVID-19 patients based on medical studies indicated so far (Figure 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 who had COVID-19 were between 30-65 years of age.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying disorders and complications and were much older than those who did not (at a median age of 66 compared to 51), suggesting age as a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000) as described above.
Co-morbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who are in need of hypertensive therapy are more likely to suffer from serious heart problems and rhythm problems.
Heart disease is also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
It has also been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2-positive colangiosites, which can lead to liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that the relationship between age and current diseases is important and can have an impact on each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is a potential long-term diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The severity of COVID-19 and the correlation of CRP levels with prognosis have also been reported.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and released in tissue damage.
Therefore, they are a traditional spectator for heart or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient growth of medical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to build conclusions and complex estimates of COVID-19.
Usage of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used in the form of supportive treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
High doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, with many survivors suffering from life-long disability and non-vascular osteoarthritis, including a reduced life expectancy.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low-dose and short-term in COVID-19 patients if needed.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 outbreak suffered from additional stress because they had to live in isolation and very uncertain conditions for a long time and witness the deaths of family members and co-workers.
It is imperative to provide mental counselling and long-term support so that they will recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to current demographic studies, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are different from that of SARS.
The recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 can occur more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract, and may not cause mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause a cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or retention period can generate a large number of viruses during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the pandemic.
However, when patients are seriously ill, SARS-CoV infection is thought to spread, while most infections do not reach the initial stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the outbreak of SARS and is difficult to control.
Efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities, and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population, to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Even though these actions are causing significant harm to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing and that is what appears to be slowing down the pandemic.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward fall phase will last for 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter has predicted that COVID-19, which seems to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini has established a pattern to predict the impact of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the mid-turbinate and thrott swabs of a patient who was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago after recovering from the disease, indicating that the newly identified virus may fall into a cyclical series like influenza.
However, the declining number of new cases is showing promising signs from China, which appears to be having a positive impact on current policies.
Initially, it was estimated that Ebola would cause millions of cases and 500,000 deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to weaken until it becomes ineffective and eventually destroys or becomes a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS pandemic (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious by coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in feces, which has increased the chances of infection to feces.
A recent study on 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases may have been caused by hospital-related infections, with 17 patients suffering from other prior illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and so on, as well as the patients or third parties who come in contact with infected people.
The first step to reduce the risk of infection is to use a face mask; both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23>1860s) help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent potentially infected persons from moving fluid points from the air to the surface of the material, so that their infection does not spread to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860) masks can stop the respiration of micro-viruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus completely infiltrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can also enter through five surgical masks on one side, healthcare providers who have direct contact with patients are required to wear N95 (series <0x23> 1860) instead of surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers are also required to wear a fitted isolation gown to avoid contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 20, 2020, despite wearing an N95 mask, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2; the virus may have entered their bodies through their burning eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers must use transparent face coverings or goggles while working with patients.
The general public in the affected or potentially affected areas are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures have been considered as effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus in the human world, as reported on January 7, 2020, it is believed that since it is a SARS-CoV, there should have been a threat bell in China due to the memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center was telling people that the new virus is less contagious and less regenerative from human to human, and it is not difficult to prevent and control the disease.
This message greatly reduced the sense of caution among the public especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and missed the crucial time to contain the disease to the minimum level in Wuhan.
The disease control institutions in China can learn from this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take the following precautions: (1) be more careful while making a public announcement because every word that a citizen utters is important and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the need for timely and effective testing of abnormal information in clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or nurses; (3) increase public awareness of the disease, and (4) impose more restrictions to prevent potential epidemics at an early stage, rather than providing relief to the public; and (4)
The outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, which began in late December 2019.
Within two months of the time of writing this article, it spread throughout China and in 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 created a sense of return of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than young people, and older people have a higher incidence and mortality than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, SARS patients do so only when they are seriously ill, making it much harder to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can become positive again due to the virus.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
This rapid progress in research on COVID-19 has not solved many important issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two-bit SARS-like CoVs has been found, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from bats.
Which animal was the medium species to infect the virus from the original host, bat or human?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the cells of the aerosol, and then how does the pathogen change?
Does the virus also bind ACE-2 expression cells to other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during a human infection?
Is it going to be a global pandemic, or is it going to be a SARS-like extinction, or is it going to be a flu?
The above and many other questions need to be answered but it may take some time.
However, whatever happens, we have no choice but to control the pandemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normalcy.
The origin of the human coronavirus disease
For thousands of years, the coronavirus (CoV) and the co-evolution of their periphery, including humans, have been driven by mutations and adaptations.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as colds.
The outbreaks of acute severe respiratory disease (SARS) and Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) have shown how devastating and lethal the HCoV infection is.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back to light and we were surprised by its high transmissibility, but its pathogenicity was lower than its fellow SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and therefore it is of interest for us to understand the origin of HCoV's zoonotic disease.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoV intermediate parasites are also known.
Identification of animal colonies can have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Exploration of the interplay of CoV-cells in animals may shed light on important information on CoV pathogens in humans.
In this review, we are presenting a review of the existing information of seven HCoVs, whose main focus is on their discovery history as well as their zoonotic disease origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs from the point of view of virus development and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) has been discussed in this context.
Apart from this, the need to successfully change the posture and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of inserted, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
In these RNA viruses, viruses that harbor the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases are called "CoVs" because they look like crowns under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unbroken genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which are classified as NSP1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins, including spikes (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Numerous hereditary-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
According to different protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation consists of the highest number of HCoVs and would have been divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rats serve as genetic sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main targets for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been constantly crossing species barriers and have emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
There are currently seven known human CoVs.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly caused by mild symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in relatively high patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manipulation.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E pathology, B814, was isolated from the nasal swabs of patients with common cold.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which produce self-limiting symptoms.
It was widely believed that the infection caused by HCoVs was generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people, including an estimated 10% crude case fatality.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula that quickly spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV) which was later named SARS-CoV-2, was the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had killed more than 3,120 and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing constantly and the world needs to prepare for the impending global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven ACOVs have their origin in bats, mice or pets.
Various evidence reinforces the theory that bats evolved from bats, in which viruses assimilated the condition and are not pathogenic but exhibiting extraordinary genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origins of the zoonotic disease of ACOV shows the natural history behind the species' leap, the structure of the force and restriction factors.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2's habitat, intermediate and accelerator parasite (V) poshinda, which will play an important role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of zoonotic diseases, interspecies transmission and the pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we emphasise and discuss the following common themes: that the parental viruses of HCoVs are not normally pathogenic in their natural parasites but become pathogenic when interspecies transmission occurs in new ones.
We also reviewed the trend of HCoV evolution in which pathogenicity decreases if there is an increase in infection.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
The animal has been known about CoVs since the late 1930s.
The HCoV-229E pathology from the nasal septum of a cold patient was first isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, before B814 was isolated for the first time.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the last decade.
A brief summary of the discovery of HCoVs in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E pathology was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and since then the WI-38 lung cell line has increased.
HCoV-229E showed symptoms of cold in infected patients, including headaches, sneezing, particle and sore throat, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the small-pox organ culture and later from the brain's serial passages.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is not distinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally and are predominantly infected during the winter season in low-temperature environments.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week after which the disease occurs about 2 weeks.
According to a study conducted on human volunteers, HCoV-229E has developed a mild cold in infected healthy individuals.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, which is called "Atypical Pneumonia" which was the first properly documented universally transmitted HCoV in human history and the etiological factor is SARS-CoV, is the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was reported in China's Guangdong province in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases, including 774 deaths, which spread to many countries and continents.
Without over-spreading, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the virus's effects may appear on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially experience muscle pain, headache, fever, particulate matter and chills, followed by difficulty breathing, coughing and then shortness of breath.
There are common abnormalities found in the laboratory of lymph nodes, impaired liver function tests and increased creatinine kinases.
Diffuse alveolar damage, cell growth, and an increase in macrophages have also been found in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require hypersensitivity and mechanical ventilation.
Along with the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected with this serious disease, most likely cytokine storm, which can be especially deadly for patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, countless efforts have been made to research HCoVs.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially found to be more prevalent in patients with respiratory disorders in children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
HCoV-NL63 causes common colds, eye strain, fever, and respiratory distress.
In another independent study, the same virus was isolated from the nasal discharge of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is found in the Netherlands, it has spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and most of them occur in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive arthritis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from the 71-year-old who was hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory distress in Hong Kong.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with severe asthma outbreaks, including community-acquired pneumonia and respiratory arrhythmias.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
While all four of these community-acquired HCoVs are well-accepted in humans and are less likely to mutate into highly pathogenic diseases, there may be accidents due to unknown causes such as those in the more virulent subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have recently been reported to cause severe respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to infect effectively and sustainably in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Although most of the confirmed cases have originated in the Middle East, cases imported into the secondary spread due to close contact were reported in these various European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The medical signs of Mars are similar to SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS suffered from severe kidney failure, which is very unusual for MERS in diseases caused by HCoVs.
The number of patients with symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting was more than 30%.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases had been reported with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to mankind.
Between mid-December 2019 and the last, a group of pneumonia patients with a retrospectively known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4 per cent.
China's case fatality rate was 4.2%, compared with 1.2% outside.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Hypertension was also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly lead to an increase in severe respiratory tract symptoms.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology, they are in different branches in the phylogenetic structure.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in patients with no symptoms and may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
Compared to the other six HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 shows a great deal of similarity and asymmetry.
Firstly, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the normal trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by features that occur during normal HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even if the incidence is low, there is also a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 in the case of SARS-CoV infection.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the peculiarities of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs derived from the community.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community-acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, as cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans decrease their transmissibility, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 reduces their transmissibility.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be found in feces.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 strain-oral infection plays a similar role to SARS-CoV in at least some circumstances, is to be made clear from future studies.
It will also be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonality just like community-acquired HCoV cases.
However, after the spread in humans, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including the characteristics of infectiousness, pathogenicity and sustainable transmission in humans, will be effective for the ultimate future of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs from all four communities that produce mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the old HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and serious HCoV diseases that are caused by humans should be eradicated.
For this to happen, HCVs should be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent for the accumulation of favourable mutations which would thwart the inhibition factors of the penis.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to become fully compatible with humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its spread in humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
Four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in humans for years, causing colds to people with immune deficiency.
These animals do not need shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been properly adapted to humans and their infection in humans will not be sustainable.
They need to be maintained and disseminated through one or more intermediate and amplitudes, as far as possible, to their animal shelters and sensitive human targets.
The features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least for now, it is highly contagious like the community-acquired HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
They will be perfectly compatible with humans without shelter or intermediary animal habitats and will be able to see if they will spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be appropriate for us to discuss the definitions and features of evolutionary, natural, habitat, intermediary and accelerator poshinda of HCoVs.
An animal can become the cradle of the evolution of HCoVs if it has sheltered a closely related ancestor sharing high homogeneity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
In these positions, the ancestral virus is often adaptable and not pathogenic.
Similarly, the parasite poshinanda gives shelter to HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the placenta is naturally infected and is a natural placenta of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoVs are put into the host of the intermediate before or during its introduction to humans, it does not adapt to new positions and often becomes pathogenic.
These intermediate parasites can then act as zoonotic hosts of human infections and play the role of amplification host by allowing the virus to replicate momentarily and then infect humans to expand the scope of the human infection.
An HCoV infection can be eliminated if it is not able to retain its infection in the intermediate positions.
On the contrary, HCoVs can adapt to midlife and, not only that, can establish long-term morbidity.
In this case, the intermediate position becomes the natural parasite position.
Epidemiological data predictably reveals that the first case of SARS has a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IgG was higher among animal traders than in the general population.
In the live animal market, masked palm civets (Paguma larva) and raccoon dogs were first identified while carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
It was indirectly strengthened by the fact that no more SARS was reported after killing all the civets in the market.
However, it was also reported that the masked palm civets in forests or fields that had no contact with the live animal market were mostly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civets may be intermediate accelerators but may not have natural habitats for SARS-CoV.
It is worth mentioning that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so the possibility of different species of small mammals also working as mid-majority agents for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these appear to be the final frontiers of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches for the natural animal habitat of SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related renalops bat CoV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats feed on the evolving human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats, but none other than WIV1 have been isolated as living viruses.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from a sample of bats that were demonstrated to be used as receptors for bat, civet, and human ACE2 cell entry.
Interestingly, SARS was able to neutralize the patient's blood flow to WIV1.
Therefore, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV among bats that share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is high homology between these two viruses, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not the intermediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the immediate parasites of SARS-CoV.
Hereditary analysis brings MERS-CoV together into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bats use CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV poshinda receptors, dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RN polymers of MERS-CoV is closely related to patterns found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in the wild.
Only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology is found between MERS-CoV and bat CoV-HKU25, which is closely related to MERS-CoV.
Thus, bats are likely to be non-immediate parasites of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that the Dromedari camels are seropositive to the MERS-CoV-specific harmless antibodies, such as Middle Eastern camels found in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from the nasal swabs of the Dromedari camel, further indicating that the camels serve as the parasite poshinde, a beneficiary of MERS-CoV.
It is interesting to note that although generally mild symptoms, a large number of viruses have been demonstrated to have taken shelter in infected camels by MERS-CoV in experimental mode.
Remarkably, the infected camels not only provide shelter to the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the defecation-mouthed route, which is also the main way to shelter the virus from the bat.
However, the question remains that in many confirmed cases of MERS, there is no contact history with camels before symptoms appear, human-to-human transmission pathways or unknown infection pathways that are likely to be caused by unknown animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat CoV RATG13 isolated from bats belonging to the rynolofus.
As is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is very good for determining the parenthood relationship.
This means that bats are likely to not be the immediate parasites of SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar bat-CoV is detected in the future.
Most SARS-CoV-2 intermediate posterior animals must have been of a species of wildlife that may have been sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the early cases related to COVID-19 being related, which are indicative of the possibility of a zoonotic-to-human infection.
Numerous recent research based on the metagenomic order has suggested that a group of small mammals in distress known as pangolins (manis javanica - eaten cats) may also be the habitat of beta-CVO ancestors associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 at approximately 90% symmetry at the nucleotide sequence level.
They group SARS-CoV-2-like toxins into two sub-branches in a hereditary tree, one of which shares a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity, with SARS-CoV-2 to a more likely receptive mortgage domain (RBD).
In contrast to the inescapable truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more varied, however, the higher the ratio is the higher the genome-wide homogeneity sequence.
Recent research on the diseased pangolins has also reported a layer of the virus on the lung samples, which were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a different assembly method and physical curation to create a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome.
You can't rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being a pangolin in the intermediate animal tissues.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the existence of direct pangolins of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence variations in SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much smaller than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
It remains to establish the path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals.
While RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins have the highest degree of sequence homology, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high degree of similarity between the RBD of pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 carried by the equivalent evolutionary evolution of selectively-drugs.
Pangolins is an alternative proposal in the benefit of recombination between beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still looking into the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the high prevalence of pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Hereditary evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originate from bat CoVs, while the parents of HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 have been found in domesticated animals.
It has been reported that the bat CoV, ARCOV.2 (Appleian Ridge CoV) found in the North American triangulated bat, has shown a close association with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, belongs to another bat CoV, named as Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, at the same time the camels were suspected as their intermediate positions.
For clarity, the current knowledge on the animal origin of HCoVs known in Figure 1 and Table 2 is given in the summary.
The evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history has been presented through a hereditary analysis.
When HCoV-OC43 from domestic livestock crossed the species to infect humans in the 1890s, the respiratory tract infection association was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is very less clear.
The bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been detected.
They have an alpha-CoV.
From bats to humans, there is evidence of several levels of support for the direct transmission of the virus.
First, humans, not the alpacas, are likely to have come into contact with bats in a shared environment.
Instead, they are more closely related to humans.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are distinct and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpacas alpha-CoV has been the cause of the outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas may have received HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic stock of HCoV-229E, the alpacas and dromedary camels can act as intermediate bases that can infect viruses in humans, as happened in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
It is apparent that bats provide a rich stock of virus species for interspecies exchange of infection between genetic fragments and interspecies species.
All the ideal conditions such as longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interactions, and the ability to fly have made bats a 'biological broadcaster'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered the Dromedari camel for decades.
These camels have well adapted to them which has made them stable and natural parasites from the intermediate positions.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and has relatively low mutation rates in these animals.
Their small number of human infections is an accident, and the human remains at the cusp of MERS-CoV because its infection is not sustainable.
The role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV is, if any, different in contrast to the role of pangolins, in the complication of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, pangolins beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be phased out for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as is the case with SARS-CoV.
Future research should consider or reject the myriad possibilities for interspecies transmission from SARS-CoV-2 to human beings.
First, bats can be parasites of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the environment with bats by slaughtering them or through a coal mine.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplification points that have recently been identified for the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Human contact with the virus comes from the slaughterhouse and the eating of hunted fish.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of animals and plants is required.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from different types of animal habitats, there are three main aspects on the side of the CoV virus that are also important in facilitating the passage of another species.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-bar RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs depends on the stage of approval of CoVs with new mutations, and the average replacement rate can be considered "beneficial" to "high" when with -10-4 replacements per 2 sites per year.
The CoV has evidence-readable exoribonuclease, which removal results in a high degree of mutation being overstated and in depletion, or even life expectancy.
Surprisingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to replicate CoVs to suppress the inhibition of these exoribonucles and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than the rate of their retention.
Moreover, the mutation rate is always high when the CoVs are not well accepted by the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, indicating a higher level of acceptance to humans.
It may have already been adopted by other nearby positions of the human being.
It also applies to MERS-CoV as an addition to SARS-CoV-2, which is well-accepted by the drone strike.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the genetic drift will make vaccinations and conditions-virals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective rapidly.
Secondly, the large RNA genomes in the CoVs carry extra amounts of flexibility in genome correction for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the chances for interspecies co-evolution, which when the situation becomes adaptive is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs.
This is supported by many other open readable frames and by the protein action encoded at the end of the genome to 3'.
Third, CoVs switch between RNA replications randomly and repeatedly through other such "copy-select" systems.
In positions they act as a mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
High amounts of homogeneous full-length and sub-genomic RNA can be recombined to create new CoVs.
Hereditary evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Interacting with viruses in relation to infection
In addition to the three virus aspects mentioned above, viral interaction with the recipient is another important factor that is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV appears to have been rapidly adopted in different positions, especially with mutations at the RBD of S protein.
In general, in the RBD of S protein, CoV is interoperable with the cellular recipient and is selectively selected by the receptor response of the host.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are on the S1 segment in the 318th to 510th amino acids, which bind to human ACE2 as well as their receptor to enter the virus.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows interspecies transmission of viruses capable of identifying various animal ACE2 recipients, including bats, bats, rats, and raccoon dogs.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be different in the RBD between human and civet virus isolates, and 4 of them are located in the recipient-binding image for interoperability with the ACE2 recipient.
The K489N and S487T mutants in the Civet SARS-CoV are in their RBDs, which can reinforce the desire for interoperability of spike protein with human ACE2 recipients.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be important in virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular recipient with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the bonding desire of their S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
Of course, a cryo-EM study has shown that the desire for these mortgages is 10 to 20 times greater than the desire for a mortgage between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-consumer is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
HCoV-NL63 may also be associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are numerous other HCoV receptors such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silicic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successfully adapting to these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
As an emphasis in muscular receptors, the effect of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and preventive factors.
Dissolution of this nutrient protein can be a stumbling block to interspecies transmission between the natural cumulative nutrient of HCoVs such as humans and bats, dromedary camels and rodents.
For successful interspecies transmission of HCoVs, the nutrient-dependent components have to be strengthened and the nutrient-resistance components have to be broken down.
In this context, in the part of this important virus-infested interaction, the determinants of renal function are yet to be identified and their specificities to be determined.
Non-prejudicial scrutiny of genome-wide and inhibition factors of nutritional adaptation may be useful for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR.
The emergence of new HCoVs: Back to zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides plenty of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
Thus, bat CoVs act as the genetic stock of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also lead to the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter the viral view.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 is considered important to be accepted in humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses are isolated, but are found to encode the Aphasari ORF8 protein.
In the early isolated strains of the disease among humans, the 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV has been found.
Since it is deleted, ORF8 is divided into ORF8a and ORAP8B and is considered to be the accepted mutation, which promotes the migration of nutrients.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with the lineage of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, with a large number of small recombinant parts found in RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in NSP 9, most often in NSP10, and in parts of NSP14.
Similarly, it has been shown that parasitic MERS-CoV has experienced recombination events in different lineages, which have been found in Dromaderi camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been delineated in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs are recombined into their non-structural genes with other animal CoVs.
Artificial selection may also contribute to the unwanted alteration of the virus genome, which often relieves the virus from selective pressure used by the immune system of the host.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototyping genera, leading to the removal of two-nucleotides.
Unite ORF4 can be found in bats and camel viruses related to HCOC-229E, alpaca alpha-CoVs show a single nucleotide inclusion, which is affected in the frameshift.
Last but not the last, evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by the pressure of selection in their parasitic positions.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were found when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual acceptance between CoVs and bats.
It appears that the bats adopted the CoV both physically and physiologically well.
For example, the defect in activation of a pre-infectious response to bats reduces the efficiency of the CoV-activated pathology.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by the upregulation of the aggressive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the compound class I molecule in the main thermodynamics.
In addition, both high levels of reactive oxygen type (ROS) derived from high-metabolic activity of bats suppress CoV replication activity and affect prophylaxis by exoribenuclase, thus providing the genesis of the virus to be largely pathogenic when it is introduced into the new nutrient.
The more pathogenic CoV lineage also evolved into recombinant, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to accept nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not arisen accidentally in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic tissues, such as bats or camels.
They produce a delicate replica without removing the strong posterior immune response.
Here, the mystery of why the asymptomatic carriers appeared and what is causing the serious problem in human infections is hidden.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the immune response and high activation of the cytokine storm, while where the immune response is more potent, lung damage appears to be more acute.
On the contrary, in the asymptotic carrier, the immune response from replicating CoVs is deduced.
This may be the only effective strategy to break down the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
The interface is particularly strong in the browser.
Thus, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the management of type-I interferon should be beneficial.
In addition, the NLRP3 receptor activation in bats is defective.
Because of this, MCC950 co-concentration of NLRP3 inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common practice, through which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occur.
In contrast, it was found that 95% of the nucleotide equivalence in bat beta-CoVs was shared with SARS-CoV, while in bat-CoVs, 96% nucleotide equivalence exists with SARS-CoV-2.
However, despite the presence of a host of viruses such as SARS-CoV in the market, the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified immediately.
The homogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins beta-CoVs has been found to be staggering, indicating that pangolins may be acting as one of the intermediate positions, or that pangolins beta-CoVs may have contributed to genetic fragmentation in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made or accidental.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have returned to the limelight.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of the importance of HCoVs in their zoonotic origin and human transmission.
Evidence of dispersal showed that bats had their origin in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and that its human transmission was through intermediate positions.
The SARS-CoV infection originated from human and Ud cat contact, effectively ending the SARS-CoV pandemic by closing the seafood market and killing the Ud cat there.
For the same reason, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent zoonotic infections, given the discovery that multiple lineages of pangolins beta-CoV are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future research remains to explain whether and how humans have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the Dromedari camel for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and are also a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Whatever was done in China's wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for the control of MERS.
To prevent the re-emergence of MERS, a holistic approach to developing an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, along with the integration of other infection control measures, should be undertaken.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, a new form of fungal infection can arise to cause an outbreak.
A variety of animal species are also found in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs are also very diverse with animal potential.
These zoonotic CoVs have numerous opportunities for evolution and recombination, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or life-threatening in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China.
In the case of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They live in their own natural habitat until they get a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics of spreading the virus, training people to stay away from bats and other wildlife species can reduce their contact with humans.
To better understand the life cycle of CoVs and their natural habitats, there is a need for continuous surveillance of mammals, which can be useful in preventing human-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent the zoonotic virus is to keep humans away from the ecological position of the natural habitat of the zoonotic virus.
Many pieces of animal origin code of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
For the first time, if the bat infects the ancestor virus of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions the bats and pangolins coexist in the same ecological position.
Secondly, if bats have played a more direct role in human transmission, it has to be determined how humans came into contact with the bat.
Third, if the third mammal really acted as a mediator, it should be clear how they interact with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should have been exposed to surveillance and experimental infection, with the possibility that they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Whether it is bats, pangolins, or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestor virus will be identified in their natural habitats in the future.
Continuous exploration in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, the important variation in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team published the Quick Advisory Guidelines for Molecular Treatment for the Diagnosis of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and these guiding principles have made a good reference for our future and the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience, so, the diagnosis and treatment strategy is also constantly updated.
In this letter, a comment on our guideline is highlighted and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (7th edition) "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" are provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak was officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named the Civil Acute Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight against the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed quick advisory guidelines and they have been published online in Military Medical Resurgence on February 06, 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since its release.
Note that even though COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness-raising knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; so diagnostics and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, some references to the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) for COVID-19 from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020 were modified in a holistic manner.
Now that our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al., they have submitted a simple multiplication proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidelines and also made a valuable reference to this worldwide pandemic.
We thank you for your great work and thank you for your support.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (Test VII version) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of suspected cases requires combining any one item of epidemiological history characteristic with two items of clinical invention, or completing three items of clinical invention if there is no clear epidemiological history.
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms of COVID-19 in the area where the infection occurred, or in the area where the infection has been detected; (2) a history of contact with cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a history of previous exposure (including a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas.
Clinical Inventions: (1) Symptoms of fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with an imagematic characteristic of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing that the total number of white cells in the initial stage decreased in general, or decreased in the number of lymphocytes.
Diagnosis of confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any one of the components of the positive phase of the pathogenic or serological evidence as given in advance: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 should be positive; (2) the viral genome sequence showing the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (3) the serum test
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or in the blood sample has been added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions
The pathological identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) frequency; and then in the seventh version, the serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers to identify the optimal nucleic acid for this rapid diagnosis, including the inclusion of blood samples from the respiratory tract, which have increased the availability of different samples, and have supported positive results of specific antibodies in confirmed criteria.
That apart, there was more and more evidence which reminded us to be cautious with sampled symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al. should update its flowcharts, as they are categorizing a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The quality system also needs to be verified in the next clinical practice and study.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come for the readers to give their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we must follow and follow the latest guidelines of his homeland.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has reported 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases in the country.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
Giving an online brief, Dr. Mirzade Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzade, two cases were reported in the age group of 60, two in the age group of 51 to 60, and one in the age group of 41-50.
He also said that two of the victims were in Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Hospital officials told a local news outlet, Adolu Agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Maitree Hospital in Kuwait.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport will remain closed for longer than originally planned, until this coming Saturday.
This public transport shutdown was scheduled to start on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The movement of essential commodities -- medical, fuel and fuel -- is still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Bangladesh on March 8, which included two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people worldwide
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University showed that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed their coronavirus-related deaths.
North Korea on Thursday claimed to be one of the few countries free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours at 10.00 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, of which 5,900 have been linked to deaths.
CBS News, quoting Johns Hopkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 people died in the U.S. on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Around the world, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, postponed the lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to receive salaries even without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament extended the national emergency by 15 days, passed resolution 215, ten absentee ballots, and one vote was against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: Previously, the curfew was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has extended his stay at home order until May 1.
Retailers in Australia have reduced the limit on toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening. The Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles reduced the ban on the purchase of its toilet paper to a package equivalent to two on and per transaction, respectively.
Aldi also launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits are posted as messages on checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
Buyers are stocking up for fear of COVID-19 if people need to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
These changes have come after the four-pack restriction on previous transactions submitted by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 appearance, reported that there would be a four-pack ban, “many stores are selling within an hour of delivery,” and said the demand is “unbelievable”, while ALDI, in its Facebook post on Tuesday, called him “unprecedented.”
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there has been a "major increase" in sales over the past week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number of such packs to two last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles ordered a larger package from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made early availability for planned Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said the retailer tried to increase the stock, but that it had been made difficult by the local council's truck-supply time restrictions.
They expect an increase in production costs, as suppliers have to meet demand, and to a lesser extent, specials.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to the early dispatch of stock, some stores will not be able to operate specials on Wednesday.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are filling up stores every night.
They found that toilet paper is a large item, which leads to a low volume of stock in numbers, and, when sold, emptys a large number of shelf space.
If there are numerous items on the shelves, such as toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there are more of them, you will reduce the likelihood of panic," said Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News.
Recycle toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said its stock has run out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper who manufacture Sorbent, emphasized that they are working 24/7 to keep the supply running smoothly.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne were offering free toilet paper to the bidder who made the first bid on its auction, when some auctions were held as buyers had time during the big weekend of Labor Day.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, eight water inserts were included in Darwin's daily print, to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, the stores were originally opposed to imposing restrictions, in which they said they had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and backs.
Similarly, outside of Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the outbreak of COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
Although the word "globally" is related to just how much a disease has spread rather than how dangerous certain events are, the WHO has noted the need for governments to take concrete action.
All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "If nations recognize, test, treat, isolate, and unite our people in this fight, we will be able to do so."
We are deeply concerned about both the spread of dangerous levels and the serious and alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this is "unprecedented" with the world.
"No other respiratory-related virus other than influenza has been tracked from the onset of the outbreak to the global outbreak," he said in comments published in CNN in February.
Ghebreyesus said: "We've never seen a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
He added: "We haven't seen a world together that can be controlled at the same time."
The current state of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said of the outbreak, "It's certain that this situation is going to get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, as well as the 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is caused by the novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes acute respiratory distress.
The outbreak was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which was declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has been recognized as a global pandemic since 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 3,64,000 people have recovered.
In China, the mortality rate is estimated at 4% while in the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
In cases of complications, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress may be the symptoms.
The time from infection to symptom onset is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is known.
The primary treatments are symptomatic and baseline treatment. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from other people, monitoring, and self-quarantine by persons suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by restricting travel, quarantine, communications, controlling hazards at work, and shutting down services.
This global partnership has led to intense socio-economic isolation globally. Sports, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled, and supplies have been severely depleted, and panic buying has led to a decline.
In 193 countries, schools and universities are closed either nationally or locally, and this has affected nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been instances of fear or hatred and discrimination against the Chinese people, other East and Southeast Asian descents and people in areas with similar and significant cases of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced due to reduced travel and closure of heavy industries.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of Hunan seafood and therefore the origin of the virus is believed to be zoonotic.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, swine flu virus, and SARS-CoV. The very early known person who showed symptoms later fell ill on 1 December 2019 and was not directly associated with the latter’s weight market group.
Two-thirds of early cases reported in 2019 were found to be related to the market.
An unverified report by South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 suggested that a 55-year-old man from Hubei province may have been the first to be tracked as of 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that as China reported a decline in new cases but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China rose for the first time.
Cases may have been reported in very small numbers, especially in those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively low cases were reported among young people, with 19 cases aged or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. 60% of the British population must be infected before achieving mass immunity, according to the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Adviser Patrick Vallance.
The reference to cases is with regard to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those who have been confirmed positive as per the official rules.
As of March 23, no countries had tested more than 3% of their population, and official policies of many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, were such that those with mild symptoms should not be tested.
According to a study published on March 16, an estimated 86% of people infected with COVID-19 in China were not detected as of January 23, and undocumented individuals were the source of infection for 79% of the cases.
A statistical analysis released on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
The primary estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
In those who do not have symptoms, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days and most commonly 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died due to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of the deaths were people over the age of 60, and 75% had cardiovascular disease and diabetes including those with pre-existing health problems. The official figures of deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic usually relate to the deaths of people who had tested positive for COVID as per official rules.
Indeed, deaths due to COVID-19 can be much higher, as they may not include individuals who were not tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Little information in Italy suggests that the highest number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times the official COVID death toll.
The spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know that [the number of reported deaths] is a low-volume estimate,” a statement that is confirmed by incomplete reports of a decrease in counts in the U.S. Such a low count of deaths occurred frequently in the January 9 epidemic, as was the first confirmed death from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1 and the first outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside China's mainland, each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Deaths were recorded in more than forty countries and territories in all continents except Antarctica as of 13 March. Several methods are commonly used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and time, and the number of tests performed, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population; for example, age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to the total number of deaths in a given period indicates the number of cases diagnosed.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death toll as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies by region.
In China, the ratio of death cases decreased from 17.3% (in case of symptoms as on 1 January 2020 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in case of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), indicating the percentage of infected (disabled and undiagnosed) deaths due to the disease.
These data do not have a time limit and they track a particular population from infection to resolution of the case.
Many educational institutions have tried to account for these figures for a certain population.
The Centre for Medicine, based on evidence from the University of Oxford, has estimated that the overall infection fatality rate of the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top of this category is in line with the first randomized trials of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyses the effects of the tests on CFR.
The WHO is convinced that this can be controlled globally.
The highest level and maximum duration of this outbreak is uncertain and can vary by location.
Macy's Boney, from Penn State University, states that "if not checked, the outbreak of infection stops at a level that increases and decreases when the host that is available to the disease is reduced."
However, it is impossible to predict exactly when this will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that it will "end by June" if all countries begin to follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-CoV2 "is likely to spread over a period of one to two years."
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be required "possibly 18 months or longer until the vaccine is available".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University states that "it is impossible to completely destroy the virus as it is so easily infected", so "it will cause seasonal disease and probably return every year."
The toxicity or severity of the return depends on the collective immunity and the scope of the change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not comparatively specific and it is not likely that people who are infected will have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, loss of respiratory secretion (cough), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, and severe skin bloating due to lack of oxygen.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed emergency symptoms; for example shortness of breath, prolonged chest pain or pressure, sudden convulsiveness, difficulty getting up, and immediate medical treatment if such symptoms occur. The disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute symptoms of respiratory distress, bruising, septic shock, and death.
Some of those infected may not have symptoms, may not have any medical symptoms, but the results of the tests will confirm the infection, so the researchers advise that those who have come in close contact with people who are sure of the infection should be closely monitored and tested to rule out the possibility of infection.
Chinese people predict that the ratio of those who do not have symptoms may be slightly to 44%.
The actual disease onset time (the time from infection to symptoms) when the virus enters the body is usually one to 14 days, usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of people who lost their sense of smell among people with COVID-19 was initially 30% and later it is estimated to have dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease has spread are still being ascertained.
The disease is believed to spread mainly due to close contact and small droplets formed during coughing, sneezing or speaking, when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
During the study, it was found that droplets can travel from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft) due to a cough without covering the mouth.
Some have suggested that small drops that come out of the mouth can also infect the virus through small droplets that can stay in the air for a long time. Even if the virus is not formed in the air, the droplets in the respiratory tract can be formed while breathing.
These drops may go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or may be dragged into the lungs along with the breath.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause respiratory secretions to be sprayed to a fine degree and spread through the air.
If someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although it may seem like a concern, it is believed that there is less risk in spreading it through the vein.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by feces or oral. Although the virus is most likely to spread before symptoms appear and during the next stage of the disease, it is most likely to spread within the first three days after symptoms appear.
People tested positive three days before symptoms appear and this indicates that it is possible to get infected even before symptoms appear on a large scale.
While there are only a few reports of asymptomatic but laboratory-confirmed cases, some countries have detected infection in the absence of symptoms when searching for contact.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has said that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person infects another two to three people. The virus survives on the surface for a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can be found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for up to four hours.
However, this can vary according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Even though British authorities advise hand washing after contact with other surfaces that are likely to have been touched by infected individuals, there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
Severe Respiratory Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus, first isolated from three individuals with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all the related coronaviruses that are in nature. The virus dies outside the human body as its protective shield is dissolving with household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus makes genes, along with subgenus cerbicovirus (Lineage B), a genetic group with two bat-borne variants.
Its entire genome level is 96% compatible with other bat-related coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in the genome sequences of humans and viruses in humans.
To date, the entire genome has been found to contain 92% of the genome material shared in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and SARS-CoV-2 in comparison, which is insufficient to prove that the beetles are the same intermediate host.
The virus can be detected temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan has suggested that CT, although less accurate, is significantly more sensitive than PCR and that many of its imaging features are incompatible with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a number of rules for the testing of SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a respiratory tract or blood sample.
Results can usually be available within a few hours.
Usually, this test is done by taking a sample of the secretion of the upper back of the nose, but a sample of the secretion of the throat can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing blood-resistance tests.
As on 6th April 2020, none of these tests were sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Selexin in the U.S. has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Specific image features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not have symptoms include untreated peripheral ground glass opacities and no polypropylene.
International online information on the detection of images of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
It is less accurate to use imagery in detecting COVID-19 without PCR confirmation due to the combination of infections such as adenoviruses.
In a large study in China, chest CT results were compared to PCR and shown that although imaging is less accurate to detect infection, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested that it should be used as a means of examination in areas where the pandemic has spread.
Convoluted neural networks with artificial intelligence based radiographs and CT have been developed to detect image features of the virus.
The schemes to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining good personal health, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, using tissue while coughing or sneezing, and putting tissue directly into the trash.
Those who have already been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have restricted travel to other parts of the country from where the outbreak has occurred or advised against travel.
The virus has spread to large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the society and some sections of the society do not know when and where they are infected. Health care providers who are caring for an infected person are recommended to take care of the standard, care in terms of contact and care for the eyes. Tracking those who have come in contact is an important method for health officials to detect the origin of the infection and to prevent further infection.
The use of location information by governments by mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about private life and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement restricting such surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, a group of more than a dozen experts were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log in with other cellphones, close to the private life of the user.
Then a message comes to users if they come in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings are spreading about avoiding infection, for example cleaning the nose and rubbing it is not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop vaccines.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when going to the toilet or when their eyes are swollen, before eating and after coughing or sneezing.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus dies with household soap because the household soap breaks its protective coating.
If water and soap are not readily available, the CDC still recommends that alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol be used.
The WHO recommends not touching the eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands.
Many solutions such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% pavidon-iodine can eliminate surface contamination (stainless steel surface can be disinfected using only one minute disinfection).
Other extracts such as benzalkonium and chroxidine are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in places such as a hospital or a nursing home, all tablets, touch screens, remote control and equipment such as ATM machines used by sick people in such areas should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and noses with folded elbows or tissue while coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as the amount and travel distance of the droplets that are spread by breathing while speaking, sneezing or coughing while wearing a mask can be limited.
The WHO has issued guidelines on how and when to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask is likely to reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not healthy.
The WHO recommends using a mask only if healthy people are at risk, for example those who are caring for people infected with COVID-19, also admits that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear masks.
The CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of cloth in the U.S. The use of disposable medical masks is particularly recommended by China for health care providers, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks while using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks in public places or from going out without covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged all to wear a face mask while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when visiting grocery stores.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan has been making more than 10 million masks a day since mid-March, and it is mandatory for passengers to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, and has recommended that those who cannot afford to buy a face mask should make masks at home.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes actions to control infection that are aimed at minimizing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The practices include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, grounds, theatres or shopping centres.
People can practice social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching while greeting, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in areas where the outbreak has occurred.
The U.S. government agencies and the Department of Health reduced the maximum number of people coming together from 250 people in an instant (if the spread of COVID-19 in that region is not known) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people in public places. The CDC advises individuals to stay at home in the wake of social outbreaks, such as elderly people and those who have medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, government disorders, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems, as the use of "ash" for the purpose of serious illness and disorder is facing the increasing risk of other forms of ash. In the latter part of March 2020, social relations are advised to maintain physical contact.
The use of the term "social distancing" had the effect of encouraging people to stay in contact with each other in alternative ways, rather than being completely isolated. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
This includes recommendations for having sex with the person you are living with and those who have not been infected with the virus or have no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are suspected to be infected have recommended self-quarantine at home.
Health institutions have given appropriate instructions on how to self-isolate. many governments have ordered or recommended the isolation of the entire population living in areas where the infection has occurred.
Self-isolation is recommended for those in high-risk groups.
Those who have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with a widespread infection have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they came in contact.
Preventing or containing the spread and mitigating the spread is the only way to control the outbreak.
Prevention of transmission is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at tracking, quarantine, as well as planning infection control measures and immunisation to prevent the spread of the disease to other populations.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, steps are taken towards mitigation of the disease: measures are taken to reduce the spread and measures are taken to reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both measures can be combined to prevent and reduce proliferation.
To prevent the spread, more extreme measures have to be taken to reverse the global pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. As part of the planning for infectious disease, efforts are made to reduce the severity of the spread, which is called flattening the spread graph.
They reduce the risk of stress on health services and give time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Unvaccinated preventive measures that can manage the outbreak include hand hygiene, face masking and self-isolation, school closures, stricter measures to restrict mass gatherings, more restrictive measures to encourage society to recognize and involve more interventions such as mass gatherings, and social measures aimed at physical distancing, as well as individual preventive measures to clean the surrounding environment.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun large-scale testing and local self-isolation and has warned of caution in the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who had self-quarantine and took punitive action against those who could not.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished for storing medical items. Following the example of Great Britain and the United Nations, there are major challenges in containing the spread of the disease (to slow the spread of the pandemic, not to stop it) and in containing (to reverse the spread of the pandemic).
Favorable schemes to reduce the spread of the disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by 2/3rds and cause half of the deaths but can still cause thousands of deaths and put huge strain on the health systems.
Preventing or suppressing the spread may be a priority but as long as the virus is spreading to the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs earlier) it needs to be maintained continuously, otherwise the infection spreads rapidly again after the measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to prevent or suppress the spread of the pandemic cause economic and social damage.
There are no specific virus-preventive standardized drugs for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop one that involves testing available drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids and taking rest in medical stores can help reduce symptoms.
The need for oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be acute.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being researched to treat COVID-19.
The WHO has also said that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO has described capacity building and optimizing health care for COVID-19 patients as basic measures to respond to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the European Zonal Office of the WHO have issued guidelines to take the resources available for hospitals and primary health care to different levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling alternative practices if possible, isolating COVID-19 positive patients and training staff and increasing the availability of ventilators and beds, etc.
There are several theories as to where the first case (the so-called zero number patient) may have been found.
The first case of this novel coronavirus can be traced to Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They were mostly associated with the wholesale market for Hunan sea food, in which live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from a similar animal or in other words, it is the original zoonotic origin of the virus. A group of pneumonia patients, caused by unknown causes, was found on December 26 and was treated at the Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jishian, who was diagnosed with the disease on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that it is time for every government on earth to wake up to reality.
He also urged that proper response measures will help the world avoid the worst of the worst.

On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.
The Managing Director stated that the WHO is "extremely concerned about the increasing level of transmission and the severity and dangerous levels of inactivity".The WHO has been heavily criticized for its reported mishandling of global co-operation with the WHO, which involves declaring a public health emergency late and classifying the virus as a global co-occurrence.

The Chinese government has also been criticised by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Glove and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, over the global outbreak in China's Hubei province.
Several administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the provincial level were fired for handling their quarantine efforts in central China, which was a sign of discontent against the established political party's response to the outbreak in that region.
Some critics believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public outcry over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have ruled out the theory of a conspiracy that originated in the US or Italy, saying the initial coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said China's "privacy has made a virus so dominant that it has become a global ally" which has been criticized by some critics as racist and "removing the failure of its own administration to control the disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government telegram containing a message from Clupti's contours of deception to the enemy that had its origins at the National Security Council and which described the plan as "everything about China."
We are being told to try and expose this message in any way, such as press conferences and television appearances. Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that the effort to send aid to China’s virus-hit areas is an attempt to promote a global dominance.
Josep Borrell, the head of EU foreign policy, warned that by making a comeback and "politics of generosity" was a geopolitical factor involving the thumping of dominance.
Borel also said that China is aggressively sending a message that it is a responsible and trustworthy partner to the US.
China has called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and has also sent aid to Venezuela and Iran.
Jack Ma's 100,000 mask-wearing aid to Cuba was blocked on April 3 due to U.S. sanctions.

It's not a good sign for Europe."
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to send military medicine, disinfecting special vehicles and other medical supplies to Italy.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper, citing an unknown "high-level political source," said that 80% of the aid sent by Russia was useless or of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of carrying out an offensive campaign of "geopolitical and diplomatic" persuasion.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi de Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent medical cargo planes to the United States.
"While offering assistance to U.S. allies, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical products and goods take the pace, they will also pay back as needed," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Piskov said.
NATO's planned "Defender 2020" military program in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states will be the largest since the end of the Cold War.
Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the program Defender 2020: “In the current public health crisis, this program threatens not only the militaries of the United States and many other European countries, but also the current situation in the country in which they are operating, and the former parliament.” The Iranian regime has been heavily affected by the virus, and almost two dozen members of parliament.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has written a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020 stating that his country is struggling to cope with the outbreak as the United States does not have access to international markets due to its restrictions against them. This outbreak prompts the United States to adopt more common social plans for public health care, including Universal Health Care, on Universal Health Care.
Political analysts speculated that this would have a negative impact on Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election, a global pandemic that strained diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's "suspicious and passive attempts to isolate" when Japan announced that all arrivals from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at a government-appointed location.
South Korean society was initially polarized or monolithic about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions to impeach or praise the government for its handling of the outbreak by Chuji, which has enabled the country to enact emergency laws in response to the pandemic.
Some critics have expressed concern that this may give governments an opportunity to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, their parliament has voted to allow their Prime Minister Viktor Orban to govern for an indefinite period of time by decree, to dissolve parliament and elections, and to govern those who are believed to have spread misinformation about the virus, and to confront the government with a crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for a number of incidents, including a shortage of supplies, which is generated by the increased use of tools to cope with the outbreak globally, panic buying and factory and transportation disruptions.
The United States Food and Drug Administration warned of a shortage of medicines and medical supplies due to increased consumer demand and disruption to suppliers.
In many areas, panic buying was observed and as a result, essential grocery items such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from the fruit of the shop, resulting in shortage of supplies.
The technology industry has been warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
As a result of this increased demand, prices have gone up to twenty times the usual price and there has been a delay of four to six weeks in the supply of medical supplies.
This has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO has warned that it could put health workers at risk.
With the pandemic in Australia, there is a new opportunity for Daigu shopkeepers to sell Australian goods to China.
This action led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high number of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan, and the high demand for upcoming food items, both parts have survived from severe food shortages.
Measures against China and Italy's illegal trade in stockpiles and essential commodities have been successful, and the acute shortage of food, which was expected in Europe and North America, has been avoided.
Since agriculture production in northern Italy is high, there has not been much reduction but the prices can be increased according to the representatives of the industry.
The shortage of food grains in the shop was only temporary in Wuhan, while Chinese authorities opened up pig meat stocks for adequate nutrition for the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food manufacturers to reserve food supplies for such emergencies.
According to a March 16 media report, China's economy has been severely impacted by the Chinese government's measures to contain the spread of the virus in the first two months of 2020, and retail sales have fallen by 20.5%.
China's mainland is the main economy and the center of production, with the outbreak of the virus being seen as a major threat to the global economy.
Economist Intelligence Unit's Agathe DeMarais has predicted that markets will remain volatile until the potential consequences are clear.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the global economic slowdown caused by the disease would surpass the time of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis estimates the world’s supply chain will be impacted by $300<0x2B> billion and could last two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been hit hard by the sharp fall in oil prices due to China's low demand.
The global stock market collapsed on February 24 after a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, amid growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed their worst fall since 2008, with a Dow 1191 point collapse, the biggest one-day fall since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices closed below 10% for the week.
On February 28, the Scope Ratings GmbH accepted China's sovereign rating but maintained a negative outlook.
In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the stock fell again on March 16th.
Many people think that there is an economic slowdown.
Economist Mohammed Al-Erian appreciated the timely measures taken by the central bank and the states.
Central banks are responding more quickly than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to travel bans, closure of public places, including travel attractions, and governments advising people not to travel anywhere around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flyby has been shut down.
The impact on the tourism industry has reached an unprecedented level.
Many railway stations and passenger boats have been closed.
It was during the Chinese New Year holiday that the main traveller of the epidemic came to Chunyan.
Many crowded events were cancelled by national and local governments, including annual New Year's festivities, as well as private companies closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland in person.
Many solar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large crowds from coming together, including the Farbden City in Beijing and traditional shrines.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions have extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to open until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised their infection response level to the highest and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year’s celebrations. The retail market area has had a global impact and shop hours have been reduced or shops temporarily closed.
Retail sales in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, there has been a 50-60% decline.
This resulted in a 33-43% drop in purchases in shopping centers in the foothills in February compared to March.
Shopping malls around the world have been forced by increased sanitation, thermal scanners to monitor consumer temperatures, and more measures such as cancellation of events. According to the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by this global partner led to more than 14 to 22 million people in Latin America living in extreme poverty.
When the pandemic hit its peak in Wuhan, about 5 million jobs were lost in China in January and February.
About 300 million rural migrant workers from China are stuck at home in the inner provinces or are stranded in the Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States could lead to 47 million jobs and the unemployment rate could go up to 32%. Close to ten times the number of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wage payments) in India due to lockdowns have lost jobs since the middle of the year. A survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canada’s households have some sort of unemployment experience.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowance, and one million British workers applied for a Universal Credit Scheme. In Germany, nearly half a million companies sent their workers to work on short-term work plans called Kurtserbight, a government-funded program.
Germany's short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The fine arts and cultural traditions of the presentations have been deeply affected by this global pandemic and have affected institutions and individuals - both employed and unemployable globally.
The Art and Culture Institutes tried to continue their campaigns (many publicly funded) which included giving the community the opportunity to experience cultural traditions, to protect their employees in public spaces and to help artists whenever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, entertainment venues, and other cultural institutions have been closed indefinitely and exhibitions, events and presentations have been cancelled or postponed.
In response to this, there was a strong effort to provide alternative services through the digital platform. Another fast-moving form of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other concerts and social events such as concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that observance of the religious week in Rome which is the last week of Lent’s Christian repentance season has been canceled.
Many bishops have asked older Christians to stay at home rather than attend Sunday prayers, with some churches offering church services via radio, online live broadcasts or television, while others opt for drive-in worship.
While the territories under the authority of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rome are closing their churches and chapels, and other religious institutions have also closed services, except for St. Peter's Square devotees, and have restricted the gathering of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, shrines, and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry canceled Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and closed them later in the day, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from visiting Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused major disruptions in the world's sporting schedule since World War II.
Several important sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021."
This has led to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Several music groups have postponed or cancelled concerts, which have also affected the entertainment industry.
Many big theatres, such as Broadway, have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have explored ways to create and continue to share art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional actual presentations, such as a virtual presentation of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute, and publish their work.
There have been many online memes on the topic of coronavirus, many of which work to create and distract jokes in this uncertain environment.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been xenophobia, intense prejudice and racism against Chinese people and people in East Asia and hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have reported incidents of fear, suspicion and hate.
In the February report (when most cases were still limited to China), records showing that Chinese people were either able to get the virus, or that they were receiving a fair reprisal, have been made in various groups around the world.
There has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
There is support for the Chinese people, both online and offline, and for those in the affected areas.
Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19 after the outbreak in the new hotspot countries, may have also been subject to suspicion and xenophobia. People from other countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially came together and signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the <0x23>ChineseDontComtoJapan has also become a topic of much discussion on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in England and the United States have reported increasing incidents of racism as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics calling it racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhari.
Students from northeastern India, who come from areas along the China border and study in important Indian cities, are reported to have experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state-level president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
Later, the Chinese embassy in Kolkata condemned the provocation, calling it “flawless.” The association of xenophobia and racism against people who are not Chinese residents in China has provoked outrage, where foreigners are described as “foreign garbage” and are targeted for “disposal.”
Current newspapers with paywalls have removed some or all of the paywalls for their coronavirus coverage.
A number of scientific publications have made scientific research available for free.
Some scientists have chosen a way to quickly share their results on a preprint server such as BioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods for detecting the presence of the virus and the antibiotics generated in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is ensured by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is also used to prevent recent or active infections.
The investigation of antibiotics can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very minor symptoms or people with no symptoms to mention.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the group in the population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable information about the spread of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country had conducted more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge gap in the number of tests conducted between the countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is also likely to be largely unrealistic in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be used to test respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
An RT-PCR test can only be done in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then be eliminated from the throat and its number in the lungs continues to grow rapidly.
When testing infected persons in the second week, a sample can be taken by the suction catheter in the deep airway as an option or the catheter can be used after coughing.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the infrastructure component of the 250,000 test kits available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England had also developed the test by January 23, 2020. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company CogeneBiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection set (Powerchuck coronavirus).
This test detects the RdRp gene specific to the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. BGI Group was one of the first few companies to receive emergency use authorisation from the National Medical Products Administration of China for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 distribution in China.
One in three of the older versions of the test kits were genetically modified due to faulty reagent causing inconclusive results and hampering tests at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in fewer than 100 samples being successfully processed each day throughout February 2020.
Till 28th February 2020, testing using two components was not considered as reliable, and till then state-level and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On 5th March 2020, Lab Corp. announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 tests across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country.
There were no limitations declared on the scale; sample collection and processing should be done only as per CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and manufactured in Russia by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, Vecter.
The test was registered by the Federal Service on 11th February 2020 to monitor health care. Mayo Clinic had developed the test to detect COVID-19 infection on 12th March 2020. On 13th March 2020, Rose Diagnostics received FDA approval for a large scale 3.5 hour trial, thus allowing one machine to conduct an estimated 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbot Laboratories to test on Abbot's M2000 system; such authorization had previously been granted by the FDA to Holographic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Safed received the EUA for a similar test to be conducted by the FDA in about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved such a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid application technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can produce fixed results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbott is expected to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. The monoclonal antibody test that binds to the novel coronavirus’ nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is expected to be developed in Taiwan in 15 to 20 minutes, with the result expected to be developed in Taiwan at the earliest.
A review of the information concluded in March 2020 that while "chest X-rays are less useful for diagnosis at an early stage, findings of CT [computed tomography] may be present before symptoms begin."
Typical features of CT include secondary heterogeneous lateral distribution with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominos, crazies, and aggregations develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan at the core of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less characteristic as it incorporates many of its imaging features, including other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "Citizenship should not be used as a priority test to check for or diagnose COVID-19." The CDC recommends PCR for early screening by March 2020.
Antibiotics with IgM and IgG are produced as part of the immune response to the infection.
Those tests can be used to detect infection, determine immunity and monitor the population approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Tests can be carried out in the Central Laboratory (CLT) or through Point of Care Testing (PoCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test a large number of automated systems that have been processed over a certain period of time, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although several samples can be used to track an immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
For POCT, a single sample of blood is usually obtained through skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for extraction before testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 components that gave instructions to the agency as needed and, therefore, they are able to deliver their antibiotic tests.
Only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization as of 7 April 2020. Euroimon Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval from the European Union for their test kits at the end of March 2020, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in the background of blood sample viruses.
The test capacity is such that hundreds of samples can be tested in a matter of hours, and therefore this test is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of the virus RNA.
It is usually possible to find an antibiotic within 14 days after infection. England did not find it suitable enough to use any set of antibiotic tests they purchased in early April.
Hong Kong has devised a plan that, in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they spit in it, they send it back and in some cases they get a test result. The British NHS has revealed that they are doing an initial study of the plan to test the suspected individuals at home or to risk others for infection if they come to the hospital.
The Drive Through Centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most-extensive tests of any country. On March 2 in Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians asserted that they had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests a day in a rotating system and 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When a doctor asks for a test, the cost of it is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, these tests were offered in many major cities.
The total number of tests conducted in Germany as of 26 March 2020 was not known, as only positive results were reported.
In the first survey of the lab, it was found that up to 12/2020 of the calendar, and 12/2020, a total of 4,83,295 samples were tested for the virus over the course of 10,000 days, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested together for SARS-CoV-2.
The construction was carried out in 5 days under the supervision of Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, and this modelling has shown that if this testing capacity would not have started on time, then 47% more cases would have been seen in Hubei and the related cost of handling the quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan laboratory has been quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in a total of 12 cities in China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As on 4th March 2020, the total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. The Open Source Multiplex Design published by Origami Assays can test samples of 1122 patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without robotic liquid handlers.
As of March, the shortage and inadequate levels of agents have been a stumbling block for large-scale testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
This led some authors to look at the sample preparation protocol, which included heating the RNA genome for 5 minutes at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F). On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more people in its population for the coronavirus than any other country, and the level of testing was higher to reach a larger population.
This was in conjunction with the drive-through capacity and the purchase of a population-scale wholesale throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency search laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to have such a large scale operational outside of China.
In China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, various testing activities targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed.
The World Health Organization adopted the action of Germany to send production sets to low-income countries without the resources to build their own sets.
Germany's action was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which led to pending trials in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test sets in the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not provide enough sets to meet the testing recommendations from demand and health experts.
In contrast, the large number of tests available in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
A large number of testing facilities in the private sector have been built by the South Korean administration over the years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization ordered the extension of testing programs as the best way to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The large-scale spread of the virus created a large demand for testing led to the backlog of hundreds of tests in private laboratories in the United States and a shortage of supplies of swabs and chemical agents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test suites.
The test set developed by the CDC in the U.S. was "flawed"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test set from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioizi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found its results to be incorrect.
The company explained that the failure to collect samples or use the set properly may have resulted in incorrect results.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would return the wrong resulting set and would instead give a different test set provided by Shenzhen BioEasy. The Czech Republic gave an incorrect result of 80% of the test kits purchased from China. Slovakia bought 1.2 lakh test sets from China which were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that these sets should be dumped in Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the sets purchased by Turkey from China were "large in volume" and they were "not used". The UK bought 35 million test sets from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
The test, followed by isolation of positive patients and tracking of those who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive, yielded good results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Italy, where the first COVID-19 death occurred, conducted two tests on an estimated population of 3,400 with a difference of about 10 days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and those found to be quarantined.
By limiting the travel of society life, new infections were completely avoided.
With aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries, and restaurants and retail outlets have not been forced to impose extreme restrictions.
Many programs have been cancelled and Singapore began advising citizens to stay at home from March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 at a time set after the holiday period.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed the pandemic through aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have found that the mortality rate is much lower in countries that have conducted more tests than the mortality rate, probably because these countries have been able to detect only mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first 10 negative samples to one of the 16 laboratories referred to by the World Health Organization for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 labs referred to, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The "Positive % of Tests" pattern in the table below has the effect of the country's testing policy.
While the other factors are similar, neither symptoms nor symptoms, compared to the testing country of all citizens, the country which tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand washing, is the act of washing one's hands with the intention of removing soil, lubrication, microorganism or other unwanted elements.
Continuous hand washing at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and rashes, which spread to the palm of the hand.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a cold, for example, if they haven't washed their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
The five most important times of the day when washing your hands with soap are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby’s cradle or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before and after eating and cooking food, or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After the baby is washed, or after the baby is washed.
When the nose is sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
after touching an animal, animal, or animal.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or before taking medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and from chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but is also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
This includes reducing the number of child deaths in the household.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing methods can lead to minor improvements in height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by initiating simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
These simple actions can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that stimulate hand washing can reduce diarrhea by approximately one-third and compare it to providing pure water in a low-income segment.
A 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with inhaled soap is the only very effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, which kills an estimated 18 lakh children every year.
An estimated 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, more lives can be saved by using soaps to wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet than by any vaccine or medical intervention, which reduces the death from diarrhea by almost half and acute respiratory infections by one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programs.
Hand washing also provides protection against the spread of Impetigo disease through direct physical contact.
The minor adverse effect of hand washing is that continuous hand washing can cause skin damage by drying the skin.
A study conducted in Denmark in 2012 found that too much hand washing can lead to skin conditions such as hand washing, loss of appetite, which is called hand rub or dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered a symptom of OCD.
There are five important times throughout the day when it is important to wash hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease by touching the mouth: after going to the bathroom (short, defecation), after cleaning the baby’s bowel (long, changing), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking food, or after handling raw meat, fish or poultry-class birds.
To prevent the spread of the disease on other occasions when the right hand washing technique should be adopted, include the following, before and after treatment with a cut or other wound; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching an animal's feces or after handling an animal and touching a waste.
In many countries, there is a shortage of soap.
In a 2015 study in 54 countries, it was found that on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that hand washing rates among children in Saudi Arabia are highest at 95 percent of the time, around 77 percent in the United States, and 23 percent in China. In some cases, hand washing is the lowest in the country.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of action measures aimed at improving children's health and education.
Brushing your teeth with fluoride and washing your hands with soap twice a year is an integral part of the national programme.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microbes from the skin is enhanced by the use of soaps or detergents, including water.
The main activity of soaps and detergents is to reduce the inhibition of solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is insufficient to cleanse the skin because fats and proteins containing organic soil elements do not dissolve in water immediately.
However, the purification is done through proper flow of water..
Due to the nature of our reuse, there is a possibility of bacteria from past use in solid soaps.
In some studies on the migration of bacteria by infectious solid soaps, it was concluded that their migration was not possible due to the destruction of bacteria due to foam.
The CDC continues to say that “a hand-touched liquid soap is preferable to use”.
There has been a significant increase in the use of antibiotics among people who are aware of their health.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of any antiseptic or disinfectant recommended for antibiotic-resistant in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial elements such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotics are not chosen for disinfectant soaps, they may not be as effective as stated.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protecting agents, effective formulations such as pH regulators contain indications of acidity (acidic acid ascorbic acid, lactic acid), pathogenic active benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (corphed, vitamin, menthol, plant extracts) from the common stock.
Warm water that is comfortable to wash hands is not enough to kill germs.
At body temperature, germs grow rapidly (37 degrees C).
However, soft water is more effective than cold soapy water in extracting natural oils containing soil and germs from the hands.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that soft water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Hand Sanitizer or Hand Antiseptic is a hand cleaning agent with no water base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most of them contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulations with a thickening agent such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) in gel form or in moist liquid forms such as glycerin, or easy to use and face to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Mild hydrogen-peroxide increases antibiotic activity. At least 60 to 90 percent of alcohol in hand sanitizers are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol rub sanitiser kills germs, multi-drug resistant germs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain pathogens (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and mold
Alcohol rubber sanitizer contains 70% alcohol, and after 30 seconds after it is applied 99.97% (3.5 log reduction which is equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) and 99.99% to 99.99% effective at 99.99% (4 to 5 log reduction) effective at killing a very small number of pathogens after 1 minute of exposure.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against diseases such as norovirus (or norowalk), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Plenty of hand antiseptic or alcohol rubber should be used to completely clean both hands.
Scrub the front and back of both hands and the space between all the fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, face or gel.
Fingernails should also be washed clean, rubbed on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand sanitizer should be applied on hands after washing when the hands appear to be dirty.
The use of these agents is increasing on the basis of simple use and rapid killing of micro-organisms; however, they should not function as a replacement for hand washing properly if soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based sanitizers can cause dry skin, so it should include skin softening substances and/or moisturizers.
The effect of drying alcohol can be minimized or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin softening substances in this formula.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients in clinical trials reduce skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity to contact gallbladder syndrome or alcohol or substances present in hand rubs are rarely found.
The low tendency to induce sagging contact skin disease compared to hand washing with soap and water became a fascination.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of pathogens because the pathogens remain on the hands.
The efficiency of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends on a very large number of components and formulations, and has historically surpassed alcohol and alcohol rubber to a significant extent.
Recently, the formulation that uses benzalkonium chloride has shown consistent and stored antibiotic action, unlike alcohol, where performance appears to have decreased after repeated use, may be due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in the low-income group do not afford soap and they use ash and soil.
Ash and soil may be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it will increase the spread of the disease rather than decrease.
Like soap, soil is also a disinfectant because when soil comes into contact with water, an alkaline solution is formed.
The WHO has recommended that ash or sand should be used as an alternative when soap is not available.
The exact technique of hand washing recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm water or soapy water.
Flowing water is recommended because permanent basins may be contaminated, and the water temperature did not seem to make much difference.
Apply a lot of soap, rub it on the hands, on the back of the hands, in the fingers, under the nails and prepare the face.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than just water to wash their hands.
Hold your hand for at least 20 seconds.
Bleeding causes friction, which leads to the removal of germs on the skin and the removal of more germs as a result of overtime bleaching.
Wash your hands under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can lead to contamination.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or allow the air to dry.
Wet and wet hands are quickly contaminated back to back. The thumb, wrist, fingers, and lower part of the fingernails are the parts that are normally disposed of by hand washing.
Artificial nails and semi-finished nails can give relief to microbes.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended so that the hands do not get dry; dry skin can cause damage to the skin which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made for hand washing facilities in places where tap water and/or soap are not available, e.g. in a developing country, if required, by pouring water with appropriate holes from a hanging jerrycan or awnings and/or using ash. Limited water supply options (such as school or rural areas in a developing country) such as "tipping taps", "low prices" and other water options.
Tipi tap is a simple technique in which a can is tied with a rope to pour a little water on the hand and on the soap, and the foot has a moving lever.
While drying hands effectively is an essential part of the cleaning process, there is little debate about the most effective form of drying in a public washroom.
An increasing amount of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than electric hand dryers in many washrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster London conducted a study to compare the level of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hot air dryers, and modern jet-air dryers, and the European tissue symposium sponsored the study.
After washing hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingernails increased by an average of 194% and the number on the palms increased by 254%.
After the drying of the jet air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42% and the number on the bottom increased by 15%.
After washing hands with paper towels, the total number of germs on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and the number on the palms decreased by 77%. As a result of each type of drying method, scientists conducted tests to check whether other washroom users and the washroom environment are likely to be polluted.
The jet air dryer that emits air from the unit at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hand and unit and polluting the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters long.
With the use of hot air dryers, microorganisms can spread from dryers to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread. In a 2005 study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand-wielding methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many hand dryer manufacturers are in existence, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels for drying.
In travel, hand washing wipes are an option to wash hands when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made it mandatory to wash hands after discovering its effectiveness in preventing disease in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
Studies have shown that their use reduces the risk of infection.
Medical hand washing is a minimum of 15 seconds, in which a large amount of soap and water or gel is used and every part of the hand is washed.
The hands should be folded together.
A bristle brush can be used to remove dirt from the nails.
It is important to wash hands and wipe them with a clean towel as germs can live in the water on hand.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and to open the exit door if necessary)
This can prevent the hands from getting dirty again.
In health care, the purpose of washing hands is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("animals") and avoid their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine has reported that the lack of hand washing in many medical environments remains at an unacceptable level, where large numbers of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to microbial infections.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple methods can reduce catheter-related blood flow infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet with the ideal method of hand-washing and hand-grabbing in the healthcare sector.
Guidelines on hand hygiene by the Institute can also be found on their website for public comment.
Whitby and others had compiled the relevant review.
If demonstration of regular adherence is required, professional tools can measure and standardize hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has "five minutes" to wash hands:
The connection between blood and body
Prior to the demolition and
After taking care of the patient. If there is an increase of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (“medication” or “micro-antibacterial” soap) the action of hitting the hand in the washing fluid is formed.
Antibiotic-resistant organisms may require such a kill action before surgery or at a place where there is a large number of people, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hand ‘toss’ for surgical walking, a chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a sterilized towel to dry hands after washing, and a disinfectant brush and a disinfectant device to moisten under the nostrils.
All the ornaments should be removed.
For this procedure, it is usually necessary to wash the part from the arm and wrist to the elbow for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long (10 minutes).
When washing, water from the wrist to the elbow area should be avoided on the back of the hands.
On completion of hand-washing, the hands are dried with unsterilised cloth and surgical gowns are worn on the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to use hand washing or hand disinfection before and after taking care of the sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing comes from the first 20% washing, and when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%, there was a slight increase.
Washing hands with a simple soap is more than three times the rate of bacterial infection in the food if compared to antibacterial soap. As every 30 seconds, the alcohol-containing solution compares hand-washing with antibacterial soap and hand-washing with anti-bacterial soap by 26% alcohol than hand-washing with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashing fluid to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium from the hard-to-remove germs. Interventions to improve hand health in healthcare settings may include training employees on hand washing, making hand-washing alcohol-based fluid more available, and giving employees written and verbal reminders.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in various healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is being considered as a cheap and necessary tool to achieve better health and better nutrition.
But the lack of reliable supply of water, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve hand washing behaviour universally.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there is a shortage of hand washing taps near every private or public toilet, despite the availability of cheaper options for setting up a hand washing facility.
However, a lack of hand washing can also be a result of dead habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Incentives for hand washing with soap and its rewards can affect policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and change the long-term behaviour of the population.
For this to be effectively implemented, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that social-based approaches to increasing the amount of hand washing in LMICs are effective, while social marketing initiatives are less effective. An example that encourages hand washing in schools is the “three star approach” by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, along with other sanitation needs.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three stars at the end.
The creation of hand washing spaces may be a part of the initiative to promote hand washing to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is yet another example of an awareness-raising initiative that seeks to change behaviour. UNICEF promoted the adoption of hand washing emojis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019-20.
Some studies have taken into account the relative effectiveness of the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries.
However, a review suggests that it is significantly cheaper to encourage hand washing with soap than with water and other hygiene interventions.
For people in particularly vulnerable situations, such as mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals - first identified the importance of hand washing for human health in the mid-19th century by two pioneers working on hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "English founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people believed that the smell of Miyamas was caused by infection.
In 1980, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health care-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States more actively encouraged hand washing as a key measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, murals depicting "the right technique of hand washing" were placed next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and on airfields.
Washing one's hands is the expression of one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to share the complexities of it.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands about the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this rhetoric came with more widespread use in some English society.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth has to be forced to wash her face in an attempt to wash imaginary stains in order to show her guilty conscience about the crimes committed and committed by her husband.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others when they remember or contemplate immoral acts and tend to give more importance to the means of hand washing.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions are asked to wash their hands for both hygiene and symbolic reasons. Using water to wash hands, but not using soap is symbolic hand washing, this is part of the hand washing ritual, which includes Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD>s, Hindus, Judaism, Tevilahs and Netilats, the Lavabos in Christianity and the Wudus in Islam. Religions are specifically asked to wash their hands after certain actions.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards caused by COVID-19
Workplace hazard control due to COVID-19 are applications of occupational safety and health practices to control risk for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
The proper risk control at the workplace depends on the workplace and the nature of the work, depending on the source of the infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-infection risk jobs have minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which original infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home when sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular workplace hygiene and disinfection.
Medium infection risk activities include activities that are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but which may have been linked to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, workplaces with dense population and some large retail outlets.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures, the risk control for this group includes air-to-air use of high-capacity air-filters, use of snooze guards and availability of personal protective equipment in case an individual is exposed to COVID-19.
The OSHO considers health workers and mortuary staff who have come in contact with a known or suspected person of COVID-19 to be at high risk of infection, including those who are carrying out aerosol manufacturing processes or collecting or handling samples of known or suspected persons with COVID-19, thus increasing the risk of exposure.
The risk controls suitable for these workers include negative pressure ventilation rooms and engineering controls such as personal protective equipment suitable for that particular task.
The spread of COVID-19 can have many effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of a possible infection.
What goods are in demand and the way to get those goods may, in both the sense, change the commercial pattern (such as buying or distributing or purchasing through drive-thru services when there is a shortage of crowd).
Finally, there may be disruption in movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19. Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be used for preventive actions.
Addresses risk levels at various workplaces and workplaces, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from household and social sectors, and risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline contingency plans for the situations that may arise due to the necessary controls and outbreaks required to address those risks.
Preparation and response planning for infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives for responding to an outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of complications that may be adverse to health, maintaining a professional track and minimizing adverse impact on other things in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the communities where the business is located affects the response.
There is a hierarchy of risk controls widely used in occupational safety and health to determine groups according to the effectiveness of risk controls.
While the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without depending on the worker's behavior and can be the cheapest way to implement them.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, should be suitable for use (e.g. respirators) and properly fitted, should be regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and should be properly removed, cleaned and sanitized or properly disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-infection risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended to adopt basic infection prevention measures for all types of workplaces, including upper and full hand washing, motivating workers to stay at home if they are sick, sanitizing their workplaces and covering their mouth while coughing and sneezing, regularizing respiratory etiquette and making available tissue paper and garbage buckets, preparing equipment for telecommunications or other devices to be used if needed.
Immediate identification and quarantine of potential infected persons is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show symptoms of severe respiratory illness should stay at home until they have had a fever for at least 24 hours without taking any other medications that reduce or alter the symptoms, have symptoms and other symptoms. The sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to take care of sick family members at home.
According to OSHA, moderate infection risk involves jobs for which such people are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but due to ongoing community transmission around the business area or the person who has recently traveled internationally to a place where COVID-19 has spread, she must have had six feet (1.8 m) of close contact with people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
These include personnel who have been in contact with the general public, such as personnel who have been in contact with personnel, such as school, personnel who have been in contact with personnel, personnel who have been in contact with personnel, personnel who have been in contact with personnel, personnel who have been in contact with personnel, personnel who have been in contact with personnel, personnel who have been at risk and personnel who have been at risk, and personnel who have to contact with personnel, and personnel who have to train, and train, and train, and train, and train, etc.
In such a situation, it is very rare for the workers of this risk group to use respirators.
Appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers in case a person falls sick on board the aircraft include the separation of that person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person, and the giving of a face mask to the sick person or the tissue paper asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing.
While serving a sick passenger or touching his bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces, it is necessary to wear disposable medical gloves and if the sick passenger has a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, the cabin crew must wear additional personal protective equipment.
Disposal of gloves and other disposable items in a biological hazard bag and then clean and disinfect the infected area. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, the risk controls include delaying travel when sick, and in case of fever or other symptoms on board, self-isolation and immediate contact with the ship’s medical center.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the room of the quarantined person. The CDC recommends a temporary closure for hygiene and disinfection even if an infected person is found in the school and child care centre.
Where there is minimal to moderate community spread, social distancing strategies can be adopted, such as field trips, gatherings and postponing other major functions, including physical education or prayer classes or lunches at restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, changing the timings of arrivals and departures, limiting unnecessary visitors, and setting up separate health centres for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant infection in a local group, with strategies to maintain social distancing, schools may be considered to be closed for longer days. The CDC considers that the immediate risk of health is low for law enforcement personnel who carry out routine day-to-day activities.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact other persons who have been infected with COVID-19 or are infected are advised to follow the guidelines along with appropriate personal protective equipment, as in emergency medical techniques.
If there is close contact during the period of care, employees should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear before reusing them using household cleaning sprays or wipes and follow standard operating procedures for the controlled period as well as for the disposal of used PPEs, for the separation of clothes and for washing.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary staff to be at high or very high risk of infection.
High risk activities include healthcare delivery, relief, laboratory and medical transport staff who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
On known or suspected COVID-19 patients, if the staff is carrying out aerosol-generating operations or collecting or handling samples from such patients, they are at high risk of infection.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cuff induction procedures, brancoscopy, some dental systems, and examination or aggressive sample collection.
Intensive sanitiser work involves personnel involved in preparing the dead bodies of persons with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of death; if they perform post-mortem, they are at high risk of infection. Additional engineering controls in these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including conducting aerosol manufacturing processes.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and toilet facilities.
The biosafety level should be handled with 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who are suspected of COVID-19 should be quarantined in a separate waiting room. As with other PPEs, OSHA recommends that employees working within 6 feet of suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and aerosol-producing processes should be allowed to use respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or better should be used in the context of comprehensive, written respiratory protection systems, including fitness-tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory protectors can provide better protection and can be more comfortable for employees. WHO does not recommend protecting the whole body, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread to other organs of the body.
It is recommended that only those entering the facility wear a mask.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, gowns and gloves for staff who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 without any aerosol-generating procedures.
If the aerosol-producing process is performed, use an N95 or FFP2 respirator instead of a surgical mask.
Due to insufficient global supply of PPE, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows should be used, which facilitates direct access to healthcare providers by using masks only for specific purposes in the classroom of COVID-19 patients, recommends reducing the need for use of PPE for those who do not have access to PPE, and maintaining a single respiratory mask while serving multiple patients with the same diagnosis.

Sending Date/Time : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in a very difficult situation this month.
COVID-19 is a global issue that highlights the interconnectedness of global humanity and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
We have no previous evidence of this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation, and building a group at the heart of our organization.
The remarkable authentication of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with amazing people is the goodwill and care that all of our colleagues see through email, phone, and chat.
I couldn't be more proud to call you my friend.
Last week, someone complimented me on my work.
He reminded me how important it is for the world to read Wikipedia at the moment, and how powerful it is for this important tool to be available online and for everyone.
This has been made possible by your work, whether you are keeping this site up-to-date or paying our colleagues or keeping your group safe.
The world of information that Wikipedia provides is much more needed now than it is now.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it will also have a meaningful impact on the world.
The importance of this campaign and your role in it will lead to some significant changes in how we work together, starting in the coming weeks.
Changes in our work and work schedules
As Robin noted earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss its approach and schedule in the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we thought about what response would be appropriate to what we are facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this period.
We have a strong desire to relieve stress and help our mission in the long run.
If you want to change it, don't change it.
For all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Our daily working requirement will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can use this campaign.
However, the world cannot be predicted at the moment and if you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't take your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
You don’t have to say it, but we’re saying it.
You don't need a sick leave or PTO - just tell your managers and help your team make adjustments to the schedule and schedule, so as to ensure that important parts of the work are completed.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Brian from T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and take care of your situation with proper attention from the management.)
Full pay will be given to the employees.
We have already said and reaffirmed our commitment to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid according to their usual working hours.
If you are sick and unable to work, this may include.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to express their stress about the world around us.
Especially during such a period, what we do can be incredibly beneficial.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to communicate with your manager, so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Fundraising Teams (among others) do important work, which may require additional help.
We will start the process with all departments to evaluate the current targets and focus on supporting the essentials for your campaign.
We have a lot of work to do for all of you, we will only focus on the most important projects.
If you work slowly, you won't get lost.
Once this world has gone along, we don't have a plan to "do double time work to get the job done."
You don't have to work extra hours to get the job done.
We accept that the situation has changed and we will work to set new goals and schedules when appropriate.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
While adjusting expectations about our new realistic and day-to-day working hours, we aim to adjust the time frame for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual planning.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will allow employees more time to prepare budgets to prioritize important tasks, self-care and care for their loved ones while including those who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This extension of time limits will greatly reduce the current planning workload and stress throughout the organization.
We will be submitting our proposal to the Board next week and as soon as we get confirmation of this, we will update our representatives and teams for further action.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office Status, Infection and Hygiene
Last week we learned that one of our SF-area employees was likely to be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, with extreme caution, we have appointed an anti-viral hygiene team to disinfect all areas in the offices of San Francisco.
They use a high-quality antiviral solution used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby, and the edge of our floor vents.
In this building, she adopts her own precautionary measures by using products that help in the safety of her tenants.
We are happy that these offices will be fully ready to work when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork area, where their solutions for COVID-19 have been shared with us and all other DC-area staff.
Last week, our DC office was completely transformed into a remote set-up in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC-area know, we're talking about renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are going on, but we can get tired of it.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Long-distance colleagues know that this will only be an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of your meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, think about how they can be divided into several days.
Explain the agenda of the meeting and send the materials to them in advance.
Make this video by default with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connection.
To make each meeting easier, ask someone to lead it, who will monitor the chat for the questions asked, check the list of speakers, and ask someone else to help you take notes (or take notes in collaboration with each other).
Send an email to a technical support team if you need help.
Use your money for the welfare of the poor.
Join the <0x23>remoteies channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the assigned work.
The Human Resources Operations Team is looking at 'Webinar Based Argonomics' to support the growth of the work that has been delivered throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to postpone Wikimedia-funded public gatherings such as "Editathons," until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we knew that our request for adjournments and other restraints would make it impossible for them to fulfill their agreed grant-in-aid, and also that no one would be punished for delaying and altering that goal.
Next week we will follow the additional guidance provided for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general feeling of the global community as a whole is sad about this disruption, but at the same time, it seems that both this clarity and the ability to focus on our own community, Wikimedia and others are pleasant.
As we move forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to allow communities to monitor this impact and provide space for the community to track our communication with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will send you an invitation to a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all here to help and to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, continue to receive information through this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office-Wiki.
The CRT will keep the page up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, ceremonies, a major workflow, or the challenges considered, or need help with anything else, don't hesitate to notify the CRT and work with them.
We are here to help and cooperate and establish contact if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive material, please send an email to Brian Juddan, Director of Human Resources Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment and obligation of our work.
Instead, they have to give official recognition to the fact that at this point our work and obligations will need to be adopted in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that, in our opinion, are necessary to cooperate with each other, so that we can continue to work, provide them with the needs they need, and provide them with the services they need.
When the time comes, we will be able to help you.
Now is the time to work together and create space for important work, which will be tackled in the coming weeks and likely months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so you need to take care of yourself and your family, so that you can give your best when needed.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K., Amy V., Brian J., Dorian D., Gregory V., Joel L., Linnet L. Ryan M., and Tony S.) and the rest of the leadership team members (Grant I., Heather W., Jamie V., Jenine U., Liza M., Robin S., Robin A.
B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 resists the action of related angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of angiotensin-II and thus it is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. For some coronaviruses, ACE2 acts as an entry point into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc metalloenzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collocation renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type of skin protein that is activated by the action of your enzyme on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extra muscle domain of ACE2 is broken down by a second transmembrane called Shedase, and the resulting solubility protein is released into the blood and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells in the arteries and heads, and smooth muscle tissue in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
ACE2's primary function is to act as a resistance to ACE.
ACE angiotensin I gives the hormone Vascoconstricting angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 breaks down the carboxyl-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into a vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr
[des-Arg9]- A number of other peptides, including bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dianorphine A, and ghrelin, can burst ACE2.
The neutral amino acid transporter also regulates the transport of SLC6A19's membrane ACE2 and is involved in heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19).
Interestingly, the binding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the surface of cells with the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis and the transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosome located in the cells.
The admission process also requires prioritizing S protein by host Serine Proteins TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is ongoing as a potential treatment in current investigations. This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in cells will help fight infection.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control”.
In addition, those who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, their risk was reduced when treated with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia, the use of ACE was also related to reducing the mortality associated with pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and this has shown to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and it takes 30 minutes to start the effect, and the effect lasts for 24 hours.
A number of findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with chronic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or intolerance to high-status angiotensin. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b-COVID-19 apps are software applications in mobile, designed to help you get in touch as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying an infected person ("contact").
Numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to create contact tracing apps.
There have been concerns about privacy, especially in systems that track the geographical location of app users.
The less intrusive options include using a blue tooth signal to log in with other cell phones of the user.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that such Bluetooth-based apps would be integrated into the functionality to support their Android and iOS operating systems directly.
The Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay in China, has made an app available so that citizens can check if they have come in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, the app called Trace Tugether is used.
The app was developed by a local IT community and made available as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched the Blue Tooth-based app “Stop Corona” to contact potentially infected individuals and quickly respond to healthcare officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on 12 April 2020 that the app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available in a few weeks. A similar app is planned in Ireland and in France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth Protocol. Russia aims to present a geofencing app designed to ensure that patients infected with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including the possibility of low effectiveness if the use of false positives and apps is limited to only a small proportion of the population.
While expressing concern over the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, limiting them to "authorised" or otherwise reputable institutions.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed serious concern about the impact of large-scale surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially on whether the infrastructure for surveillance designed to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance in a statement.
The Institutes have issued eight conditions for government projects:
The monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Sunset clauses will have to be extended for monitoring and surveillance;
The use of the data should be limited to the causes of COVID-19;
Information security and anonymity have to be secured and shown to be protected on the basis of supply;
It is necessary to avoid extreme discrimination and neglect due to digital surveillance;
The sharing of information with third parties should be defined in the law;
The right of citizens to protect against abuse and to respond to abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and neglected groups, need meaningful participation. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Ohne Grenzen)(RSF) have also released a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of permanently removing the tracking system from their device operating system once the need for tracking is over.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-protected systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication.
A system was used to present contact tracing in South Korea that was not based on the app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected various tracking information, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and collected potentially-infected individuals to create notices through text messages.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the Government has made location information publicly available, something that was allowed, due to far-reaching changes in the Information Privacy Act following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, considered both central and privacy-protected systems.
Details are not available as of April 6, 2020.
Privacy - Protected Contact Tracking is a well-established concept, with at least one research material since 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log on to other cell phones that are user-friendly.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized systems and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy - proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and other mobile contact tracking mechanisms (CAT).
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device and all matches are on the device.
Privacy groups at MIT Media Lab are developing SafePath, a platform to use privacy-protected techniques while collecting or using location or path-breaking points to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research of the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a technology developed by Enigma MPC, which was originally set up at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace allows the user to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of that data, using secure data hardware technologies.
On April 5, 2020, the World TCN Alliance was formed by groups that had basically come together around the same approach and largely covered protocols, and their objective is to enable the functionality of fragmentation, manipulation and alerting apps, which is a key aspect of widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol open source used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for contact tracing based on Bluetooth low-energy technologists and a combination of private cryptography, in which they claim privacy will be maintained.
He also highlighted the features of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be implemented in three steps:
Roll out of tools to enable governments to create government secrecy - to protect coronavirus tracing apps.
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS, Android, and Apple's first operating system updates by distributing the system, and then removing the threat again in the same way.
B'drug repositioning (also known as drug reuppersing, re-profiling, retasking or therapeutic switching) is the use of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease or disease in children.
This is the same kind of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and quality treatment for COVID-19.
Plasma Infections for Vaccines and Resuscitation. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 druggable proteins, each of which has several associated binding locations.
The analysis of such bonding location provides a suitable scope for the preparation of a potent anti-viral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Husain A A and others studied various candidate compounds followed by a similar analysis of its similarity with the approved drug so that it could be recommended in the clinical study framework by developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-qualifying drug in their preclinical studies.
Chloroquine is an anti-hypertensive drug that is used against some autoimmune diseases.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests in the state of New York on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be conducted from March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA.
The approval for these treatments has not been obtained through the FDA's clinical trial process and has been authorized under the EUA only for experimental treatment for patients who have been hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial.
According to the CDC, the "use, quantity, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been certified.
Doctors have said that this medicine is used when there is "no other option left."
A small study has been conducted by the Turkish research team in Istanbul, in which chloroquine is being used with zinc, A vitamins, A vitamins and D vitamins.
A large number of studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and quality of hydroxychloroquine is being tested as a preventive measure by NYU Longon Medical School.
Favipiravir has been claimed to be "fully effective" by Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen.
While 35 patients tested negative in 4 days at Shenzhen, the duration of illness of 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In the study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminded the public that the existing quantity in support of the drug is inadequate and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for stockpiling, and take the help of the army and distribute it to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe held formal talks with the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in patients with severe conditions because the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (caletra) in which a joint study of anti-viral lopinavir and ritonavir was carried out concluded that "there was no benefit"
The drugs were developed to prevent the production of HIV replication by binding with proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to find a binding compound with the protein of SARS-CoV-2 by modifying these drugs. The use of the drug developed by HIV/AIDS for a new purpose has been criticized in the scientific field.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. The Gilead Sciences then discovered that Remdesivir had shown intravenous anti-viral activity in filo-, pneumo-, paramexo-, and corona-viruses.
One of the problems with anti-viral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations that result in more serious diseases and infections.
Some pre-trial studies have shown that remdesivir is likely to have high gene resistance to resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, with two trials ongoing at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild illness and the other for people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are under way for patients with severe COVID-19 and hospitalized; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

The role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 is currently being studied by researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada.
More than 6,000 adults with mild symptoms who are 40 years of age or older, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and do not need to be hospitalized are being recruited for a study called "Calcorona."
Pregnant or lactating mothers as well as women who are not following the effective method of contraception are not eligible.
A number of clinical trials are being carried out in Italy.
Heparin with a low molecular weight is being used to treat patients, which encourages medical institutions in Italy to publish guidelines.
Italy on April 14 announced a multicenter study of 300 patients to research for the prevention and therapeutic dose of anoxaparin sodium.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention is being paid to the use of anti-viral drugs that were previously approved for the new target in MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment with COVID-19 as per the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Umiphenovir: Umiphenovir was recommended for treatment with COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Some antibiotics have been found to be usable for the new purpose of treating COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor): approved by China
Also see tests in China and Italy and Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is an anti-coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.
Although clinical trials of any vaccine have not been completed, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said at the end of February 2020 that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which causes the virus, is not expected to be available before 18 months.
Phase I safety studies were carried out on five vaccine candidates in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The outbreak in the world in 2020 led to large-scale investment and research into vaccine development.
Many organizations are using the published genome to produce a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the CEPI initiative's prerequisites for developing vaccines are speed, manufacturing capacity, magnitude planning and global reach.
CEPI scientists were informed in April that research and development was underway on 10 different technology platforms in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of Phase I security studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Cansino Biologics, Adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to information received by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in development stage, out of which 78 projects have been confirmed to be in progress (79 according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 have been announced, with very little information being made public (assuming it is planned or planned).
Phase I-II trials have conducted a preliminary examination of safety and antigen potential and are usually randomized, placebo controlled and at multiple locations to determine the exact, qualitative quantity.
Phase III trials generally have more participants, including a controlled group, and the efficacy of the vaccine is checked to prevent disease, and with an adequate amount of monitoring for side effects.
Out of 79 active development vaccines (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (preclinical research is still underway).

In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cloud computing resources, along with Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the United Nations government, industry, and three universities combined to access IBM's supercomputers.
Some vaccines have an odd effect, which can also be called an unintended result.
This means that it can also have other benefits in addition to treating the disease.
Further, 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomised trial in Australia.
The vaccine that is being developed is likely to be not safe or qualitative.
Previous research conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine on COVID-19 specific animals, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals and other primates other than humans, suggests the need for biosafety-level 3 regulatory measures for handling live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Anti-SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animals other than humans.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine for SARS or both safe and effective vaccines for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, finding and developing novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority task for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is also no standardized vaccine for MERS.
When Mars became more powerful, it was believed that the ongoing research on SARS would provide a useful sample for finding a vaccine and medication for the MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines were in the works, all of which were viral-vaccinated vaccines, two adenoviral-vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-GAMVAC), and one MVA-vaccide.
The post on social media has sparked discussion of the conspiracy, according to which the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and the vaccine is already available.
Patents, which emerged as evidence from various posts on social media, refer to the genetic sequence of other coronaviruses such as the SARS coronavirus and the existing patent for the vaccine.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Fever, cough and difficulty in breathing are common symptoms.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhoea, cough, shortness of breath and abdominal pain.
The duration of onset of symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to 14 days.
While most patients have mild symptoms, some patients experience an increase in the disease, resulting in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 have died.
More than 5,68,000 patients have recovered from the disease. The virus is spread mainly through direct contact with people, often through coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
While breathing, these tusks are thrown out and fall to the ground or to the surface, they do not carry infection for very long distances.
People can also be infected by touching their eyes, nose and mouth by touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can live on any surface for up to 72 hours.
The first three days after the onset of symptoms are highly contagious, but it can be transmitted both before and after symptoms appear. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the nasal solution is the standard method of diagnosis.
Those suspected of contracting the virus are advised to wear masks.
The general public is advised to use masks differently, some officials are opposed to the use of masks, some are advised to use it and some say that it is necessary to use it.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19.
The disease has been reported in most countries in all six regions of the WHO.
Patients infected with the virus sometimes do not show symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty in breathing.
Sudden symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant chest pain or stress, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and feeling pale in the face and lips; it is advisable to go to the hospital immediately if these symptoms are found.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.
In some patients, the symptoms of anaphylaxis were less severe, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some patients in China initially showed symptoms of chest ache and heart ache.
In some patients, pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death were reported.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some people it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who developed symptoms showed up within 11.5 days after infection.Reports show that not all infected patients develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet clear; however, they are said to be involved in the spread of the disease from an early stage.
While the proportion of infected patients who do not have symptoms is not yet known and are being studied, 20% of confirmed cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) are reported to have no symptoms until they are in hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic patients in daily cases from April 1; out of 166 infected cases reported that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of testing.
Both the nose and the mouth carry a large amount of virus.
It's easier to talk than to talk normally.
According to a study conducted in Singapore, a non-covered cough can cause the tussle to go up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.
Even if the virus is not produced by air, the National Academy of Sciences has ruled out the possibility of bioaerosol transmission, and positive virus RNA has been found in samples taken from gas collectors located outside people's homes.
Some medical procedures, such as inserting a tube into the body and resuming the function of the heart and blood vessels, can cause the discharge to fly through the respiratory tract and thus spread through the air.
When there is concern about the spread of the virus, the risk is considered to be low. People with symptoms are most susceptible to the virus; moreover.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three people. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
The virus has been found on paper cartons for a day, on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) for three days, and on surfaces with 99 percent copper for four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the environment and changes accordingly.
They can be effective if soaps and detergents are used properly; soap products degrade the thick preservative layer of this virus, inactivating it as well as separating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other measures, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a kind of disinfectant for surgery) are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, red samples were taken two days after being admitted to the hospital.
Of the six patients, five were found to have the highest number of patients in the first sample and the sixth was found to have the highest number of patients tested on the second day.
Civil Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the Center for Severe Respiratory Diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corona virus associated with it in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that creates its own protected bubble. SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The greatest impact of COVID-19 is on the lungs, as the virus reaches the original cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the second type of cells in the airways of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spikes to bind to ACE2 and enter the original cells.
In China, 12 per cent of the patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan have also been found to have severe heart pain and it is often found in severe illness.
Symptoms of acute heart injury due to the inflammatory response of the body system and immune system during the spread of the disease are widespread, but severe heart muscle injury may also be related to the components of the heart receiving ACE2.
The ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are included in the function of the heart.
Examples of blood clotting (31 per cent) and blood clotting in the veins (25 per cent) have been found on a large scale in severe COVID-19 patients. They may be associated with an unsanitary prognosis. Post-mortems of patients who have died due to COVID-19 have found their lungs to be dysfunctional (diffuse alveolar dams).
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tendency to infect cells in the respiratory system along with the mediterranean cells for ACE2, severe cases of COVID-19 show signs of hyperinflation.
The appointment of inflammatory IL-6-infectious monoocytes and acute lung disease was found to be associated with the presence of particularly pathogenic GM-CSF-injector T-cells in COVID-19 patients.
The post-mortem also showed the infiltration of white cells.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several guidelines for testing the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the accepted method of testing.
Respiratory samples obtained by the strands of the throat are usually tested; but respiratory secretions or sputum samples can also be used for this purpose.
The results of the test are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but this requires two samples of blood done at a two-week interval and its results are of immediate low value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the virus and publish its genetic sequences, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that identified the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose the current infection and also tell if a person had previously had the infection) were being developed, but they were not widely used.
The accuracy of the tests in China is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first Point of Care test for use at the end of that month on March 21, 2020. Diagnostic guidelines announced by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods of identifying infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of disease.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass ambiguities were common in early infection with peripheral, asymmetric and background distribution.
As the disease progresses, it is possible to develop subplural dominance, bizarre pelvis (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar fillings) and condensation.
There is little information available about the physiology and microscopic injuries of COVID-19.
The following are some of the important aspects of post-mortem diagnosis:
Things that can be seen with the eyes: inflammation of the lungs, pain of the heart, swelling of the lungs and swelling of the lungs
There are four main types of pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary inflammation, exacerbation of lung cells, uncomplicated large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammation of white cells, and formation of multicellular large cells
Acute pneumonia: Impairment of the lungs and uncontrolled discharge of the lungs
Diffuse Alzheimer's disease is caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and acute lack of oxygen.
Healed pneumonia: uncontrolled discharge in the pleural cavity and interstitial fibrosis in the pleural
Bleeding: internal secretion of blood vessels (desaminated intravascular coagulation); leukarythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
When coughing or sneezing, it is recommended by the CDC to keep a handkerchief in the mouth and nose. If it is not sneezing, it is recommended to cover the nose with the corner of the hand.
People are advised to wash their hands after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has suggested wearing face coverings in public places to limit exposure to asymptomatic people. The purpose of social distancing is to reduce contact with infected people. Schools, offices have been closed, travel restrictions have been imposed and mass gatherings have been banned.
People have been asked to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other.
It is not yet known whether the drug will be effective for COVID-19. The vaccine is said to be the earliest, but it is not expected to be available until 2021, so an important part of the management of COVID-19 is currently being brought under control. It has also been called 'Flatting the Curve'.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear to be damaged, before eating and after touching the nose, after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends using hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. The World Health Organization (WHO) has given two formulas for local production in areas where commercial products of hand sanitizer are not available.
Antibiotics in these formulas are produced by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to prevent the growth of microorganisms in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand germination."
Glycerol has been included as a moisture-resisting ingredient.
Supportive care is administered to patients, including providing oxygen, fluid treatment and supporting other vital organs that have been affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are carriers of the virus should wear a simple face mask.
The treatment of oxygen from outside has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits of it are still visible.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in those with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Critical pathologists and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies and given them under a single open source, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals from the symptoms suggest the use of paracetamol initially instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the process of spraying of bodily fluids in the air, such as in the use of a body tube or hand ventilation, while using medical facilities.
The CDC recommends general precautions, contact care and airborne spread precautions for health workers taking care of COVID-19 patients, as well as keeping such patients in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). The CDC has also outlined guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Preventive equipment recommended for preparedness: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be given priority instead of face masks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved the use of masks under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against dust-like particles in the air but, in other uses, its effect cannot be guaranteed for a particular biological medium.
When masks are not available, face coverings or homemade masks can also be used as a last resort as recommended by the CDC.
Most COVID-19 patients are not as serious as medical ventilation or some other option, but a few of them are.
The type of medical respiratory facility that patients are getting due to obstructions in the respiratory tract due to COVID-19 is being studied continuously for people in the hospital. The process of tubing in the body can be avoided through high-passenger nasal or bilevel positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two benefits are equally beneficial for patients with severe illness.
Some doctors prefer aggressive mechanical ventilation treatments if available, as this technique limits the spread of pathogens in the air as compared to overpass hoses from the trachea. The severity of the disease is very high in older people (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, so a sudden increase in the number of severe cases of COVID-19 can limit the capacity of the healthcare system in handling the question of hospitalization.
According to a study in China, 5 per cent of the total patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3 per cent needed technical support for ventilation from outside and 1.4 per cent died.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in China were eventually admitted to the ICU department.
Due to the development of acute respiratory tract problems (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes more complex and becomes more and more difficult to deliver oxygen.
When ventilators with pressure control capabilities and high PEPs are supplied with oxygen, it is necessary to reduce the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by ventilators.
High capacity PEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and many antiviral drugs have since gone through trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it will take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the tested drugs have either been approved for other uses or are going through further trials.
Anti-viral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization participate in trials to study the impact and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval for treating convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine that they are effective and safe treatments for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can show 'close contact' on the monitored data and it can detect the possibility of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app suggests self-isolation if a potential risk is indicated. Not only does it provide information to local health authorities. Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are all used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to monitor infected patients and their contacts.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security departments to check mobile phone data of people who may have been infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to enforce quarantine and to protect those who may come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom handed over the location of the phone to the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, which will be used to prevent the spread of the virus and for research.
Russia has established a face recognition technology to detect people who break the quarantine.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Julio Galleria, said he was receiving information via mobile phones.
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 partners.
Estonia's President Kirsty Karluleid has called for a global response to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may find it distressing due to quarantine, travel restrictions, fear of adverse effects of treatment or infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress, and economic decline are the root causes of a threat to people's mental health and well-being."
These diseases may have little or no symptoms at all, which is compatible with other respiratory diseases such as colds and coughs.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while severe cases can take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on information from other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, it can be said that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but there is no information available about COVID-19. COVID-19 can affect the lungs in some people, causing pneumonia.
COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can develop in people who are severely affected, which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure, etc.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage, etc.
Six per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have been diagnosed with blood clotting, an increase in the prothrombin period, and four per cent of those in these groups have been found to have impaired kidney function.
Close to 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been found to have high liver enzymes.
The same report states that the period between the onset of symptoms and death of the disease was ten days, of which 5 days were to be admitted to the hospital.
However, patients admitted to the intensive care unit were admitted to the hospital and the time between their death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the median time between onset of symptoms of the disease and death was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) said that men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Post-mortem pulmonary sample histopathetical tests show diffuse alveolar lesions along with cellular fibromyal oxide in both lungs.
There have been cytophytic changes in the cytoplasm.
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is associated with pulmonary embolism.
Of the deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, 11.8% showed a high level of troponin or heart failure.
According to the U.S. March report, 89% of people hospitalized already had some complaints. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affected the deceased.
The regional gap changes the mortality rate in this situation, but also due to systemic difficulties.
Reducing the number of mild cases can lead to a higher mortality rate.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of cases that have come in contact in the past may mean that the current mortality rate has been reduced.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers, and an estimated 2.4 times more likely to require hypertensive care or die. Concerns have been raised about the long-term frequency of the disease.
Officials at the Hong Kong hospital found a 20% - 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who had recovered from the disease, and a lung scan showed organ damage.
This is likely to lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, it can be said that immunity is likely to appear, but there are cases in which the coronavirus test has been reported to be positive in the next few days after recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that in such cases, there may be a longer infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be a natural one and its origin is believed to be an animal and its spread is due to infection.
Its exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the infection was entirely caused by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January in 'The Lancet' showed that December 1, 2019 was the earliest date for symptoms to appear.
The official release by WHO has listed December 8, 2019 as the start date for the onset of symptoms.
A variety of measures are usually used to calculate the deceased.
These numbers vary from region to region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the period from the initial outbreak and the population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO provided an emergency ICD-10 code of U07.1 for deaths confirmed by laboratories from SARS-CoV-2 infection and the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection not confirmed by the laboratory. The number of deaths confirmed by medically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 during the course of the disease is U07.1.
The global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
This number varies by region. Other measures include case mortality (CFR), which displays the percentage of people who have been diagnosed, who have died from an illness, and 'infection mortality (IFR)', which displays the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed), who die from an illness.
These figures do not have a time limit and tend to depend on the specific population infected through the case version.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can hardly inform how many people have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, 4600,80 (1.7%) people have died so far in a small village called Castiglian d'Ada.
In Gengelt, the disease was spread and spread to young people due to the Carnival Festival, which had a comparatively low mortality rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19-infected deaths could be formally classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system is not so much a burden.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, as reported by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rates of this pandemic are different for women and men.
Studies conducted in China and Italy found that men had a higher mortality rate.
Men in their fifties are most at risk. The lowest mortality rate between men and women is in the nineties.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of these gender differences is not known, but the cause may be genetic and behavioral.
The gaps in gender-based immunity, the low prevalence of smoking in women, and the development of co-morbidities such as hypertension in men at a younger age than women, could all have been the cause of higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not getting gender-neutral information among people infected with COVID-19.
The research found that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at greater risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of the disease hit the target: December 31, 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a particular geographical location (such as, China), animal species, or group of people, which was in line with the international recommendation of the nomenclature, and was intended to avoid stigmatizing anyone. The virus that caused COVID-19 was named as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communication, the WHO uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in addition to this.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases as interim names for this virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidelines against the use of the site in the name of this disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Some digital manufacturers are printing health care materials as water swabs and ventilator parts due to the limitation of capacity in the standard imperfection circuit.
For example, in a hospital in Italy when there was an urgent need for a ventilator and the supplier was unable to replenish it on time, a local startup company did reverse-engineering and printed 100 valves at night.
In the wake of the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the origins, magnitude, treatment and other cases of the disease created a conspiracy, inaccurate and distorted information, and quickly spread online.
It has been found that humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence that the virus was replicated in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
The government is conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the WHO launched a "Solidariity Trial" to assess the treatment effect of the four existing antiviral compounds that are most effective.
There is no vaccine available at the moment, yet various agencies are actively producing the vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurotransmitters to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccines have been developed.
The goal of the researchers is to develop a vaccine for the virus.
The purpose of the use of such a virus, whether it is a passive or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the human body's immediate immune response.
Another strategy is the sub-unit vaccine, which aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to a certain sub-unit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such detection focuses on the S-Spike protein that helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme neurotransmitter.
A third strategy is about the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, an innovative technology to create a vaccine).
The safety and efficacy of any of these three strategies require clinical trials. On March 16, 2020, a clinical trial of one vaccine with four volunteers was launched at Seattle.
This vaccine has a risk-free genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enrichment has been suggested as a potential challenge to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active medical tests are being conducted.
Seven tests were being evaluated through treatment already approved for malaria, including four on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese search operations include multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine tests on Phase III on Remdesivir in many countries, according to a report submitted at the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of medical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is present. Several existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remedyvir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta.
According to the March 2020 report, temporary evidence is present for the effect by Remdesivir.
Medical improvement was observed in patients treated by RemedyCivic.
Phase-III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, this research requires a comprehensive review.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending one gram of its daily dose, noted that its double dose is very dangerous and can even lead to death.
The FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on March 28, 2020, based on the doctors' discretion to treat COVID-19 patients. The Chinese Seventh Edition Guide also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Primary data suggests that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in testing.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further testing following the demonstration of low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have noted that ACE-2 interacts with the technologist to initiate transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Spike protein is very high in protein content.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major difficulties that prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can cause complications in the next stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guide by the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
In Italy, non-surgical Phase 2 trials are underway at the national level after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
When combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm, it means resisting such development, which has been thought to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, Interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine-releasing syndrome, a different cause called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no random, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The search is underway as a non-vaccination method of inactivated vaccination of people in need of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it did not yield any special results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action, through which passive antibody treatment against SARS-CoV-2 can be carried out.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are under development, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which contains the blood fluid protein of cured patients and which contains antibodies that are specific to this virus, can be extended for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
