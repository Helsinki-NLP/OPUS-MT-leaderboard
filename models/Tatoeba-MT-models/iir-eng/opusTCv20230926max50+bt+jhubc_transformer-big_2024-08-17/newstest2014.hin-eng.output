Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to repair the collapsed highway system, many are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driver and transmits that information to authorities, has become a controversial issue for the Washington and State Planning Office to renovate the outdated system to finance America's major roads.
In general, boring work, such as highway planning, has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
Keeping details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive — and then using this information to prepare a tax bill — have teamed up with Libertarian environmental groups to mobilise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The Tea Party is amazing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states were not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can go into a system in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor-drivers have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a very important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether or not we're elected," says Hassan Ikhranta, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, who plans to begin tracking every mile set by motor-drivers in California by 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost gone bankrupt, financed by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
Now the car in a gallon of gas runs more miles than ever before.
There has been no increase in federal taxes in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians refrain from raising even a penny in taxes.
“Gas tax is absolutely not sustainable,” says Lee Munikh, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
“In the long run it will serve as the most rational option,” he says.
WONX calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, because it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars drive, which can help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
California planners are keen on this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set out in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (IPA), also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favour of the payment per mile by the driver.
“It’s not just the doing that’s going into the blind well,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries who, in their report in 2011, favored Congress to move in the direction of per-mile payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a 90-million-dollar test project last year that would have involved 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural law-makers, representing persons who have to walk a lot of miles to go to work or to the city daily, the House leadership ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
It has the most aspiring oregano, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed preliminary testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers some time ago, the drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation, says “Concerns about the Big Brother and other similar things were the major problem.”
This is not what people wanted.
As the trial progressed, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It will be fairly easy to convert these devices to a full-fledged tracking device.”
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology infrastructure, which must necessarily be spread to keep a record of every person's daily commute.
Nevada is one of many states that is making every effort to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details on how many miles the car is running per day, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it's testing was good for highway planners, because it doesn't use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modems at fixed time intervals.
“If you don’t track people’s speed and their location, they’ll be more willing to adopt this approach,” said True Mileage chief executive Ryan Morrison.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-interference ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to give drivers.
They can choose a GPS device with or without GPS.
Or again choose not to take any device, but instead choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be determined by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are attempting to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay according to your drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motor-drivers can use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, “Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it because of the benefits it will receive.”
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payment by mile is a major distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the problem of the Insolvency Highway Trust Fund very easily by increasing the gas tax.
Drivers of hybrids or other cars can also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
"What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work," said Randy Rantschler, the commission's legislative and public affairs director.
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of concealing the belongings of the deceased.
The police have submitted the final report of the investigation to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum river.
His family had accused his friends of killing him as he was missing his mobile phone and other belongings.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were checked and it was found that her phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
The woman, during interrogation, said the phone was given to her by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in the Padshahi garden and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail had gone to Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Zumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the stuff on the side, while Ruhail went to the other side to smoke cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, only his clothes.
Ruhail searched for Zahid, but he could not find him.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other things and kept them for his use.
He didn’t tell anyone that he had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid died due to drowning and it has been confirmed in the post-mortem.
However, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 of the IPC for concealing the facts and belongings of the deceased.

MRF wins J.D. Power Award for 10th time in a row
Chandigarh: India's largest tyre manufacturer and one of the top 15 global tyre companies MRF has been awarded the JD Power Award for the tenth time in a row.
The award is widely regarded by peers in the automotive sector as the equivalent of Oscar and holds the highest recognition in the industry.
Very few companies have received this award consistently for so many years.
The MRF has increased the limit for high-end vehicles in the range of performance radial tyres called MRF JLO
Low-profile tyres of 40, 45 and 55 category are now available for many other vehicles ranging from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The 13 size range now includes models of more than 70 premium vehicles from Indian roads.
A water purifier has been gifted by the Du Guard Company for clean drinking water at the Bhagwan Valmiki temple in Naya Nangal.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has married a 28-year-old girl.
This was revealed by his family friend, Martha Polanco.
According to him, three-time Prime Minister Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francesca met Balsoni when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia party.
This is Francesca, whose relationship was being said that her relationship with Balrussoni is just a hoax.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Martha Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to the secret wedding.
The event took place three weeks ago.
When asked what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place at a private chapel in the former Prime Minister's residence.
Nothing else can be said.
However, he did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjot Singh Sidhu.
The couple got married about three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, she got engaged to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman 50 years younger than her.
In order to avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi had based loneliness behind his decision.
In low-lying areas too, the rain continued intermittently between the eye-middle of the sun.
With this, cold wave has started in the entire plaint.
The minimum temperature in Srinagar was recorded at 4.8 degrees Celsius, Gulmarg minus -0.2 degrees Celsius and Leh -1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coldest place in the state.
Meanwhile, the Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed for traffic due to heavy rains and snowfall.
There is heavy snowfall on the Jojila pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
The activity of the Western Disturbance led to the onset of snowfall and rain in the high hills and low lying areas of the plains early in the morning, which continued till late evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People were forced to stay at home to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was disrupted in many areas.
Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
In Jammu too, the night temperature has gone up due to heavy rains.
Jammu recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the western disturbance has started to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lotus, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather is likely to remain dry in the plains from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who is lodged in jail on charges of sexual harassment, was again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage that Asaram has argued, he is being projected as a child blood drinker Dracula, but the court rejected his demand for a stay on the media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop broadcasting news about Asaram, saying they have seen every word reported in the media and see no reason to interfere.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and others?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer had accused the media of spreading rumours about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had more options.
Earlier, the court had turned down Asaram's plea for a ban on media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case to date.
The group operator of the mall cut off the TDS and paid to the financial institutions concerned, but did not pay it to the government exchequer.
By doing so, the TDS money continued to be deposited with itself.
The group, which arrived in Mumbai on October 17, had teamed up with the Jaipur investigation team.
During the investigation, it was found that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the team of TDS had started the action of the Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, the mall operator's group was raided and the survey was conducted.
Angry over the action, the businessman has made it clear to the officials of the Income Tax Department that he is not ready to pay TDS money to the Income Tax Department at the moment.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking action.
Officials investigating the case have clarified that in case of non-payment, the account will be sealed and recovery action will be taken.
Due to Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
Due to this, the sale of cheap and fake nuts is increasing.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mava and chemical sweeteners.
The department has seized Rs 70,000 from Maava and Rs 5,000 from Quetta Colony in Madhya Pradesh.
With the increase in the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for low-cost nuts from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department was informed about the garbage being brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The goods are being transported from Nagpur to Nagpur.
The department took possession of the mave, which was valued at Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not put anyone right on the road.
The department destroyed it by treating it as an unclaimed (undeclared) property.
The police recovered around Rs 5,000 in cash from the spot.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to shine brightly and last longer.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
Joint Commissioner of the department SS Deshmukh said that the search operation for chemically-processed sweets and substandard and fake ones will continue.
In the next few days, the information of this campaign has been given by the department to speed up.
The use of these sweeteners can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the sweet traders to make sweets from good milk, mave.
The department has appealed to the people to beware of fake sweets and mave.
He was received at the airport by 42 senior BJP leaders.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar on a BJP-led visit to the state.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is planning to organise a yatra to console the families of those killed in the Patna blasts.
A total of seven blasts took place one after the other during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna on October 27.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts had intended to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people could be killed and an atmosphere of terror was created in the state.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The leaders of the party left their village on Thursday for the yatra.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will flow together in the Ganges in Patna.
As part of this journey, Santhana Yatra is organized.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
They will visit the villages of the people killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday and meet their families.
During the visit, he will also provide a cheque of five rupees to the families of the deceased.
This financial assistance has already been announced by the BJP.
India will look to win the series when they take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
India had to win the Nagpur ODI to stay in the series after two consecutive ODI matches were washed out due to rain and its batters gave it a record win, thus levelling the series 2-2.
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the sea of the team will be on the batsmen.
The Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the biggest target is also proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have high hopes for the team.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got such an opening pair which is making the rest of the batsmen's job easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he made a brilliant opening partnership and gave Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
Virat Kohli is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar because of his performance so far at number three.
In fact, many cricket pundits have called him better than Sachin.
The 25-year-old, who is set to hit 17 ODI centuries next week, has won 16 of them.
Chasing the target, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive reliance on these three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj had been flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open his account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, for them, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can be a lifeline.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding that he be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impression in the opening.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling can be overwhelming for Australia.
Johnson, who has so far performed brilliantly in the series, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of a show-caused peace.
Citing intelligence agencies reports, Singh said in a statement issued here today that Pakistan is pushing for a high-altitude infiltration of around 2000 terrorists ready in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has been in turmoil ever since the separatists' plans to incite the people of Kashmir to worsen the situation on a large scale failed.
Referring to the visit of the separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizb chief Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be unleashed in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand to abolish the privileges of the Army in the state as lethal in such a situation, the BJP leader said such things are also anti-people till there is permanent peace in the state.
These are anti-national elements.
He stressed that the statements of the leaders of the army, the security forces should be stopped.
Snow Dane ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, American intelligence informant, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fails to respond about his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Bale, met Mr. Snow Dane in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum, to speak about testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted by Mr. Snow Dane to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: “Although the results of my efforts are overwhelmingly positive, my government party – as a change – considers dissent, and does not provide any defence that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of hooliganism.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dane said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abdicate criminal charges against him.
Charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit online: “If Mr. Snow Dane has been willing to talk to German authorities, we will have to find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims to have bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees the intelligence. He said that if Mr. Snow Dane had the opportunity to hear as a witness “without completely ruining the relationship with the United States and putting them in danger,” it should still be taken.
Mr. Straw Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter feed.
He was on a trip to Russia with two German journalists.
According to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Snow Dane is not able to return to Russia if he leaves Russia.
If Snow Dane testified in Germany he would be "safe" there that assurances would be needed, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Dane said that he had to leave home "for a gruesome and sustained campaign."
He, however, said he was "happy and overwhelmed" by the world's broad reactions to his work of political expression.
World citizens - including the United States - as well as high-ranking officials - have judged the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines Carries - On Baggage Charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to carry luggage for passengers on its aircraft board.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said that $25 will charge if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if the passenger waits to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be achieved to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
The airline started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid the passenger charges are filling up as much as they can carry - on baggage which is stashed in overhead compartments, this means there is often less space in this compartment.
The fee is a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It has become increasingly difficult to find the place of the overhead bin that is about the most loyal customers of Frontier.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fees will not start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline prefers them.
They argue that it costs money to handle baggage, and travelers who want service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of deficits.
Although most of them are not even touched by carry-on bag charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started carrying the on-duty first three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with one such fee, another airline is Hungarian-based Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, and which tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year that was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines official, recently flew into Spirit and expressed surprise at passengers having to face carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process was comfortable with what I had seen in my airline career," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and see a fight at the gate.
"The plane was full and he climbed it leaky-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that travelers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and will give it free coffee only once.
It will still give water away.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months later they retreated after passengers complained and followed no other main airline there.
This move by Frontier to charge a fee on Carrie-on if Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is its latest attempt to operate customers towards their own website.
The airline pays the online travel vendor Orbitz such $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September, many often started paying half the flight mile for customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows the sole passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenues fell 9% and its flight capacity fell nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released by the corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republicans are trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA accuses "internal error" instead of hackers for website crashing
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical glitch, not because of hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not in access for several hours tonight, due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-scheduled update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
The claim is not true that this obstruction, the delivery of service [D.D.O.S.] came due to attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was shut down for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still inaccessible.
A NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not even in agreement" with the agency.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a high volume, until the site is closed due to the server being overloaded.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly secretive NSA, which was once named "no such agency", has become the subject of widespread debate and bitter criticism in the past months with the emergence of a large number of foreign and domestic spying programs - which were collectively disenfranchised by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to secret NSA files.
Due to the growing controversy about the agency, there was speculation after tonight's incident that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the plot of 'Another Dronacharya', showing harmony between the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's context, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path by being tied in chains.
The function was jointly inaugurated by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Cantonment Council Vice-Chairman Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The play depicted the similarity of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and the circumstances of Arvind, currently a professor.
Directed by Anil Sharma, the play features Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Besain, Hemant Goel, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun among others.
The play was designed by young artist Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
On the occasion, various cultural and literary awards were presented to the winners.
Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, president of the Urdu department of Charan Singh Vivi, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and painter Jitendra C. Raj were present on the occasion.
Among the officials of the executive committee, Surender Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi and others contributed in making the event a success.
Bombardier's profits decline as aircraft delivery, orders drop
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter in its train unit and as pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on the issues that would release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or complete its ambitious program of going into commercial service from next September.
About one and a half months after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has just flown three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell short of the forecast and the stock has sent for more than 8 percent sliding on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, downgraded his rating for "field performance" from "fat" on Thursday to "field performance" during the next one or two quarters when the stock is limited.
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are obviously disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, the market will be skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now chop it off at the low end of the Boeing and Airbus-dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
Potential buyers wait for the test result of the flight to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as per the firm's orders for CSeries, the averages are up to 177.
With 15 customers and operators of 403 complete orders and commitments are available.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time it first put the jet into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going as per schedule.
"The test aircraft lived on land longer than anticipated," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that land testing and software updates were also scheduled during the aircraft's intermission.
Each manufacturer makes a different set of plans.
We decided to do a first flight and have an updated period and said what we have done.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second remaining of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said it evaluated the entry-in-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the service in-entry will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
The adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues dipped marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenue was expected to reach 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on Sept. 30, with no change since Dec. 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenue fell 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said revenue in the world's largest train manufacturer, the division, had grown by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Order backlogs in the transport unit were $32.6 billion of approximately September 30, up from a modest 31 December.
Some large contracts in the margins of the transport division were also affected by the execution issues.
Executives said the new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Among Bombardier's shares, which Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Picchet announced the board's inclusion, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday as well.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
They don’t lie to anyone and don’t think like stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our minds change and we keep the ideal aside and start walking against the rule.
Researchers from Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business at Utto have given many interesting facts in this research.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values without the stress of work in the morning, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or high pressure in the evening.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point is higher on the left or the right.
Participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they will be paid.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while conducting experiments on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in check.
This allowed the researchers to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not matter to our honesty, but we stop focusing on morality in the evening.
The study was published in the journal Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the miscreants fled the spot.
The injured have been admitted to a hospital in a serious condition.
Sunder, son of Sohanvir, a resident of Madhi village, recently retired from the post of Under Engineer from the Department of Power.
On Wednesday, he was returning home by bicycle after withdrawing Rs 44,000 from a branch of Syndicate Bank at Bhola.
Two bike-borne miscreants robbed Rs 44,000 in cash from Sundar.
When Sundar protested, the miscreants shot him in the stomach, causing him to be injured.
His family members and villagers rushed him to a hospital in a serious condition.
No case was registered till the filing of the report.
Three days ago, Jasvir, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot dead by two bike-borne miscreants while returning home from the same bank.
The police have not been able to make any further arrests in the case so far.
Meanwhile, SHO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incident would be revealed soon.
When the hotel staff protested, they started beating him up.
RK Singh, the younger brother of the hotel owner, started a scuffle with the son of a drunk MP.
In the meantime, many more people came.
When he tried to catch the youth, he opened fire from the revolver.
The firing spread panic in the area.
The hotel staff caught hold of him and informed the police.
Munna Singh, the owner of the hotel, lodged a complaint against Anand Pandey, son of BJP MP from Berwa Paharpur in Bhadohi district.
The police arrested Anand and took him into custody.
According to Handia Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, runs a hotel called Rag Darbar on the national highway.
Around 8 pm, Anand Pandey reached the hotel and ordered a meal.
When the food was delayed, he started abusing, assaulting and firing.
Anand was under the influence of alcohol and threatened to kill hotel staff.
The inspector said the hotel is close to Bhiti village and is adjacent to Bhadohi district.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer jailed for giving secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
42-year-old Basharat Ditta had informed the notorious criminal Neel Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people might find out about his secretive drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
The defence's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he feared people would find out about his secret addiction to his drug, has been jailed for three years.
42-year-old Barasat Ditta, after compromising on his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information to the notorious criminal, Neil Scarborough, about his drug-trafficking activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash," and who was praised as a "top brief" by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Authorities saw Scarborough, 32, carrying three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
After the discovery of cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, his wallet, and his credit card, investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of A-grade drugs.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by police as part of the main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Among them were 32 others, who were jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million during several raids, and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared people wouldn’t know about his cocaine addiction.
Detta, who works for state law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was facing a failure in Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of obstructing the course of justice after a three-week trial in Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to having cocaine at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad time began when while investigating Scarborough, the police found that he had been in regular contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and placing more than 60 per cent purity drugs under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta after he was drugged, who went out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
Upon reaching home, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and there was a conversation between them nine times.
The court heard that Datta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine during the trial when he found traces of A category drug on his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client and said his discussions were a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Detta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by taking out his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run office from his place of work as well as from his house, and his clients used to call at his house for legal matters.
After the main accused were informed by the arrested persons about what the detectives knew about them, the court said that Ditta used to call the key persons of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier presented the case.
Anne White, on behalf of the prosecution, said: “The criminal lawyer should know best about not breaking the law.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate, associating too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the general drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing the drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits of the lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting it.
He made much closer contacts with certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said that: “Mr. Ditta transformed himself from a criminal lawyer to a criminal lawyer at the same time as Mr. Detta began to receive drugs from organized criminals.”
Due to his cocaine addiction, he was highly compromised and became too weak for the purposes of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape from his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, who was also found guilty of three incidents of possession of cocaine and now obstructing the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a client with a death sentence in the US, to be his dinner guest of Mohammad Ali, and to be an inspiration for his work of inequality.
Kenya's Press Condemns Controversial Media Law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying “this is a frightening place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in the future?”
"This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it,"" said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and the operator of the news website CapitalFM."
He said the new media tribunal would "always remain biased, because it is part of the government" and that banning content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject the bill and send the MP people back," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will give the government "strong control over the media" while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "has been a severe blow" and described the bill as "brutal."
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an Islamic gunman attacked the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media broadcast security camera footage of the squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them purposely looting the mall, prompting authorities to anger Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimyo had summoned two journalists and mediapersons for questioning, although the summons were withdrawn after the media created a ruckus.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings and individual journalists one million Kenyan Shillings, and there would be an additional risk of being "deleted from the list" or not being recognized by the official press.
In case of non-payment of penalty, the Tribunal also has the power to seize the property of the violator.
According to the Daily Nation, “One sentence is enough to shake the foundation of most FM stations.”
It also said that these measures could lead to what is described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By shutting down the media, politicians know they can make their own mind up.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew describes Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing “no one will ever know.”
“If left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and lead us back to an era of hunting and hoarding.”
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the wrath of the people.
In May, he voted in favor of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and reinstated about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free bodybuilders salaries, which are considered among the highest in the world.
The birthday of the wife of the world's richest Indian Mukesh Ambani is on November 1, but as the clocks ticked twelve on the night of October 30, the whole Jodhpur became buzzing with Nita Ambani's birthday.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration was completely made up of the performance of AR Rahman's team.
In this musical night which started at 8 pm, Rahman gave a presentation of his signature songs.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage to dance with her fans.
Around 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for Nita Ambani's birthday celebrations.
Due to the low parking space at Jodhpur airport, the charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars, including BMW and Jugar, were procured.
Sood said that the cleanliness system, street lights have completely failed in the city.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that Panchkula should be completely removed from the house.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Sood said that after the municipal elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors, but they do not have the power to get work done.
The city has become a place of refuge for the wicked, and the city has become a place of refuge for the wicked.
Sood said the municipal corporation has crores of rupees, but all the money is being deposited in the banks as FD and interest is being charged.
But no steps are being taken to invest money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of a dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in the Ghaggar Par sector have been forced to live a hellish life for the last several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in village Jhuriwala for the last several years, but the people of Barwala area are already suffering from a serious problem of flies.
He said that the condition of health and education system in the villages has deteriorated.
Till date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in the rural areas.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is about to begin work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
In order to replace the MDD that ends in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” just before the Sustainable Development Summit that began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to "rise above national interests."
“I am very happy that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for setting up the Universal Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development roadmap.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to meet our far-reaching objectives of sustainable development goals based on the success of MDGs.
Mozambique’s security concerns rise as powerful figures clash
With a statue of Mozambique's founder President Samora, who was staring down at them, thousands gathered in central Maputo for a rare public demonstration to raise the slogan of peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Souza, chief executive of an investment company.
Frightened about his country's future, he changed his corporate dress from a "we demand security" printed T-shirt in a portuguese and joined the crowd at Capital Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, the conflict between government forces and Ray Namo has been reported almost daily, more than 20 years before a peace deal.
Ray Namo was once an infamous rebel of the movement supported by white-dominated Rhodesia and South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have encouraged foreign investors and locals.
Some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil’s Well, Eni, could bring in investments of more than $50bn next year, after discovering Northwestern’s vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves are high for the fast-growing economy.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namo says the government launched the latest conflict by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Ray Namo stronghold, on October 17
Attacks on former rebels and then increased government forces attacked Renmo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Majang, Ray Namo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Djibouti has called for de-escalation of concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" "whatever it was, his forces continue to try to prove that he can enforce his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mazang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace deal was cancelled by Ray Namo but later again became a matter of concern.
He told FT that that agreement is not being honored by Free Limo
Our vision is to return to the negotiating table, but seriously," Mr. Majang said.
The last round of talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease the raging tensions of this year's conflict.
"It's about the two big men (Gibuzhan and Dhaka) fighting together," said Yusuf Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are willing to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of the municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an attempt to win concessions and economic loot from the government.
Ray Namo's share of voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Ray Namo member, is expected to improve its performance in the Mozambique (MDM) Democratic Movement, elections.
Mr. Majang, who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want to give up presidency because he doesn’t want peace, he doesn’t want transparent elections,” Mr Mazang said.
It is not clear what kind of capacity Ray Namo has, but it is a major hit-and-run tour of police stations and vehicles on the North South Highway.
Most of the clashes are in Sofa La Province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with host Beira Port, which relies on exporting miners, coal, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week after threatening to attack the Ray Namo line.
Whether Ray Namo would be able to repeat this threat or not, Mr. Majangvinit was almost asked.
"Things weren't going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," Mr. Majang said.
The government of instability further exacerbated frustrations, says Fernando Lima, the head of a media company that is an independent, many are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and recent floods of kidnappings.
"The people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and think he should be the one to find solutions to problems," he says.
Omar Sultanate, an exhibitionist, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace then, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Children should be taught "as a model for a way of life", Myths and Legends.
Thor's stories could show that "in the cruel power there is no combat for all subtle tricks," while in the Arthurian legends the importance of having a dream is revealed.
It would not be appropriate to teach many of the myths "exceptionally far away even in the wild and in some cases even in porn and in schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" of appropriate actions of the age.
"I find it amazing, in America, myth and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I've been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more persuasive" and it is "a new turn" for children, with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, together with writing the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folklore, said: “Your intentions may be many but it would be better to keep it out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between writing an adult writer for a child and writing an adult writer for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything has to be simplified or come to a happy end, because but it is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than being told through a story revealed.
The old base is not showing.
Head Constable Om Prakash retires after 32 years of service in the police department at Ghoomarwin.
On the occasion, officers and employees of the police were present.
Om Prakash is a resident of village Bhaparal of Gram Panchayat Bani Bhaparal.
He provided better services during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People may argue that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: About a hundred years ago comic playwright Frank Fey, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to direct jokes from the way people in the crowd interact.
Fe's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Designed and operated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute, Carolyn Hirsch, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners appeared in Carolines, and became huge successes, to a level where they became too big to play in the club,” says Hirsch.
We built this celebration as a way to continue to work with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which included Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians who participated in this year's festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as coming shows on small networks like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Crawley, from Deep-Cable sitcom (F.X.'s hilariously ranchie fantasy-football theme "The League"), now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall the Shell with Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate, (anthony jesselnick, a sarcastic, ethnically focused w. kamau bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the most highlights of the celebration will be an interview: David Steinberg's talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a stand-up comedian, but has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, she hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry’s works,” Steinberg said.
They were telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go to the street between the two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would be here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as a report offsets concerns over more supplies, as China's power-hungry construction sector continues to strengthen.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel in Europe until late in the morning in electronic trading on the U.S. crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 5.8% for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In more than five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 2.5 million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand activity showed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came on Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a two-decade-long 7.8 percent decline in the third quarter.
Brent crude, also a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
The court blocked the New York Police Department's pause and action on sports policy.
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring the New York Police Department's pause and sports program to block changes and remove the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2 and Judge Shira Shindeller said the judge's ruling would be pending on the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city had ruled in August that it violated the Constitution in a way that prevented people from being detained and excluded from his programme of questioning.
The city's police department has appealed its findings and its remedial order, including its policy and decision to allocate a monitoring to help with the training program change associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request on Tuesday.
The appeals court has said that since he compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews and the public misbehaved with the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges, the judge's case should be removed from the case, the statements should be publicly held accountable for criticizing the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers wrongfully violated civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and sports program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some premises where most stops occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stoppage.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for sometime after 14 March 2014.
The pause and sports device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and sports policy has been around for decades in some form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, recorded an all-time high from 684330 in 2011 to the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration that has dramatically prevented growth.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men from all minorities and became a class action case.
Supporters of NYPD’s pause and change to the sports program have said that inappropriate behavior will end up having a more reliable and effective police force mold and may affect others to use the police department’s policy.
Opponents say the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but will solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after the crime, money wastage and not shrunk by thousands of officers during the past decade.
The judge noted that the termination was not for pauses and sports, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of NYPD's stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were given information about various disciplines including tent pitching, flag poles.
The training is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Esha Ghosh.
In the spirit of unity, all the participants are joining in the worship of all religions.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is extending his special support.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Colson, a former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clarke's affair when he was home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Poulby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcahy to hack Polly's voicemail and "keep watch" the male, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of the NOTW, is not known for standing outside people's homes and keeping an eye on them, but for keeping articles in front of people, to see how people react to it," said Mr. Addis.
He said the NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one included the editor himself.
He certainly knew the other way around, of course.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew exactly."
Rumors about Clark's romantic relationships were first introduced by the AOTW's feature desk at a time when a sexually inclined source in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
In August 2006, a tape of voicemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Polby's phone, from her home in Mulcahy.
Investigators also found entries in the personal investigator's computer on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named "Projects."
During the period during which she was being examined, Ms. Polby's grandparents were called anonymously and asked for information about her.
Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup witnessed Ms. Paulby’s arrival and departure.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said Colson's involvement in the case is only in Parton with other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blinkett about a romantic relationship with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to negotiate with others to hack phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlbeck and WeatherUp have accepted phone hacking.
Promote corporate fear from NSA disclosures about state surveillance.
Late in August on a quiet day, a German police helicopter rang the bell at the US consulate in Germany's financial capital Frankfurt.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the lissing antenna and signaled an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin..
James Clapper, director of U.S. national intelligence, stressed that the U.S. should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and to increase American companies' international competitiveness or increase their bottom line" again in September.
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began telling American surveillance the treasure of his secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if the director will keep his word.
The US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo, expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe’s most powerful people can be targeted, certainly business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible for these data to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMI, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies consultancy, the U.S. has now become almost a bigger risk than China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that the U.S. has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the EU. And it should make efforts to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are suspicious of this.
Someone in the German Parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
Hasso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP, said "it's no way,"
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he didn’t have to die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's exposed revelations about U.S. technological sophistication and spying access have proven to be a blow to some companies who previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing arena where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to that jurisdiction and have therefore become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the data prism mining program.
“We saw a new question that customers didn’t come across a year ago – that is – my data said stored? And can you guarantee it will be physically in that jurisdiction?” says Jim Snabey, SAP’s co-CEO.
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore these should be guarded at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
It has always happened.
“It’s been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussions, nothing has changed,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
At the US commercial and industrial level, we spy on and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it’s been a long time since message records have been around whether it’s unwise to leave a business from home by carrying a USB stick, or to say the least to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of car manufacturer Audi, says that this is an age-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to the risk on foreign trips.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown away.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, this many companies topped the global market in a special place.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of its own companies.
According to the France The Washington Post, US national intelligence in February was named in a second tier of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence, which is behind China, along with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company when it comes to economic espionage, “French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in the interview that: “The services know well that all countries spy on their allies, even if they cooperate in non-terror battles.”
At the US commercial and industrial level, we spy on and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one is stupid.
The parents of the Georgian teenager killed in an "unsolved accident" believe his son was murdered
A Georgia teenager whose body was found wrapped in a restling mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found trapped in a mat standing directly behind bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators at the Lawrence County Sheriff's Office concluded Johnson had died in an "unfortunate accident" but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Benjamin Crump, a lawyer who represented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that he "absolutely believes his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in the death of the sheriff.
“They believe that this is beyond the logic of physical laws and common sense,” Kramp said.
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He had sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mueller said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many of the key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he killed for a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring the truth to the fore.
“I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation.”
Moore told the reporter that the initial autopsy showed signs that Johnson died as a result of "situational asphyxia."
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.”
"There are a lot of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do it.
The representative was not immediately available for comment from the Landage County Sheriff's Office when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some clues as to how he died.
C.D.C. issues Children's Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control children's food allergies in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the U.S. government, as the number of school going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in every 20 children in the U.S. now has a food allergy.
The CDC found that there was an 18 percent increase in food allergy cases in children between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children’s food allergies and how to handle them in case of any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep a stock of epinephrine to cope with potentially deadly acute reflux (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the epinephrine brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep stock of higher amounts of epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms to be transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is sticking in my tongue," "It feels like I have hair on my tongue," or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their Children’s ‘Gender Unscheduled’
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for children born with a vague genitalia.
Newborn babies will no longer be traditionally designated male or female.
The new law does not require parents to declare gender for such children, which allows them to declare gender ‘undefined’ or ‘unspecified’ on a child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make gender-specific surgical decisions for newborns in a hurry, and combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, “Neither am I a man, nor a woman.”
I will continue to be a wounded, stained ligament made by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children a year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under scrutiny for sexual development disorders, a collective term used to refer to abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testes), or abnormally developed sex.
Wells Simpson may have been intersex.
While gender identity is still not well understood, most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify gender when sex determination may not occur and observe the psychological and physical development of the child before performing surgery, if such a situation occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-identity issues, said Germany’s new law “appears to be a good thing.”
Intersex children create moral dilemmas.
“Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but that’s not the case with most children,” he said.
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of how a penis will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
This is a kind of puzzle as to why people are gay.
The report, filed before the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related but biological, which is neither explicitly male nor female, but is either a joint form of either or both, or neither is clearly defined.
These characteristics may manifest themselves as secondary sexual traits, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark men, women or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal for having an "unspecified" gender status to life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passport will also have the third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender are still controversial in neighboring France.
In 2011, dozens of French law-makers from this strictly Catholic country signed petitions to withdraw “sex theory” from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany’s law, saying, “While the world is moving into a state where gender is the choice itself, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would love to see the babies being gender-specific at birth.
On the website, he said, "Childhood without extra boundaries is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and security.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (female), named after the handsome Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the penis as a slate that could be erased and then written down.
But now a lot of people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are realizing that gender identity is a complex task, and sometimes even a mistake can be made by doctors who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Drescher says "in the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a "psychological emergency."
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The existing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, who considered the penis to be well-manufactured.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental cues – how parents raise a child – interact with the child’s genes and hormones to determine whether he is recognized as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan”, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had been accidentally sex during lingagracharm - removal (circumcision) that they should take the child's test and take him out as a girl and rear him as a girl.
“Money presented that case as a successful case of transition, but that didn’t happen,” Drescher said.
At the age of 15, the child transformed himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, individuals undergoing these sex surgeries began to come out "not happy with the result."
The same was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with an X.Y. male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Physicians clearly did not understand that his penis was small, or that his clitoris was large, but they were certain that he could never live a “satisfied life” as a man.
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce 's external organs and testicles were removed by surgery and she was raised as a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, she was going to have vaginoplasty with her.
But depressed and feeling something wrong, she demanded medical records.
This led him to discover the terrible truth.
I was tied up at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, he took testosterone supplements and removed his breasts.
He was discharged due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people in an organization called the Interface Project to normalize their perception of intersex individuals.
However, Anne Tamer-Mattis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany’s law “invites chimpanzees and stigmas.”
“Many activists feel that Germany’s law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and specify the child to be “unspecified,” she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We think that rather than waiting, it is better to specify the male or female gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,” he said.
The law of Germany is concerned with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Pittsburgh breast radiologist Dr. Erlen Bartz, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany’s law would “give power” to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen receptors had defects, female traits developed in Katy.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries in her body.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“This law facilitates parents not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Bartz said.
It provides them with the proper understanding and time by some trial before writing, ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you live well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a loving child and have fun with it.
We don’t need to have surgery in a hurry that can’t be reversed.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that they feel they're doing right," he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he or she is more comfortable with—and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
The legal awareness camp was organised by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Ramnagar under the chairmanship of Ramnagar Sub-Judge Sandeep Kaur.
In which students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for the economically backward people.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj and sarpanchs were present on the occasion.
A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Report: Biden considering dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton as Biden's replacement for Vice President.
The most notable of the revelations is the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, by Mark Halperin and John Hellemann, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to find out what dumping Biden could help in Obama's hope of re-election.
According to the Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book gives complete information about the efforts made in the campaign of the chief executives and the White House, the former White House staff chief for the name, to find out how the former state secretary Clinton's shift from the vice president affects the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the Chicago campaign’s infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s close advisers – including Dal<0xC3><0xA9>, former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlord and David Palouffey – knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Dal<0xC3><0xA9> tried to change Biden despite his personal rapport before finally making a decision when his information was telling that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dal<0xC3><0xA9> confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said keeping an eye on the whole scene, and one of them, it was," Dal<0xC3><0xA9> told the newspaper.
You remember when the presidency was in danger, we were in a position like, "Holy Christ, what more shall we do?"
While Dal<0xC3><0xA9> described the research as a "caution," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments to find out how much dividend it would claim if polls were held.
"The campaigns don't spend on voting and focused groups like money unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, Halaki, did Obama know that his team was looking for change?
Martin told CNN that he asked Dalle if his boss was aware of a possible reshuffle.
While Dal<0xC3><0xA9> said he "didn't think the president knew about the potential change," the former chief of staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew it.
"Double Down" sure: Won't answer if Obama's desk was hit by a political investigation? Martin further explained.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama wasn’t aware of Biden’s dumping ticket research.
"Maybe," said Martin.
Glow-in-the-dark ice cream likes?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the finest breakfast.
He came up with this idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical glow to re-grow proteins.
Ice cream, which reacts with the tongue, will increase the pH level of the protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream is ignited by reacting to the heat of the mouth, that is, the more licking you win, the more it will be ignited.
Charlie, the founder of the Lick Me I Am Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: “It’s an incredible thing but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from <0xC2><0xA3>200”.
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms, the protein will raise the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been experimenting for the past few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween because it gives amazing glow effect
It will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've made because the glitter of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
Ikea is very good.
The experimental company based in Charlie's Bristol, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf, is famous for its unusual flavor.
But his next creation is going to be even more ambitious.
He said: “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is inherently impossible because of the ice crystals that create refraction over ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the anti-inflammatory properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was full of customers at Rani Bagh Market.
Recently, people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same was the case in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
Similar scenes were also seen at Pitampura, Ashok Vihar and Sarafa shops in Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver ornaments and coins.
As a result of this, there was a jam in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more of a fan.
I haven’t even signed up to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably won’t this year either.
But statistics show that there is a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating $158 million Halloween this time, $6.9 billion will be spent on candy and costumes and decorations.
One of the things I've always wanted to see is all the Halloween costumes.
According to the NRF, the total cost of the dress is estimated at $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion.
This year, we're all obsessed with sex toys.
Women don't have to be prostitutes; they also have to eat sexy food like pizza, hamburgers, and carrots.
I hope a lot of zombies for the men, and thanks to that, the dying space will make our Instagram feeds for the men this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be zombies, Batman, robbers, and thieves.
I don't think there is anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed up as dogs and were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend $330 million on pet costumes.
This is the reason why there are a lot of hot dogs with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don’t look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairdressing bars, lollipops, milk dads, twislers, and Clark bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, this is good news that 41 million trucks and trucks are going to take part in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and the jokes we're making, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we will not use during Halloween is candycorn, but that too will sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion of Mecca's personal guts.
It's a mystery. To solve yet
There is nothing more important than the home of the iconic Halloween spirit.
They are best named, "Terror Behind the Wall" (which, in fact, is a prison), "Chic-O-Cheek" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to the American government, there are 1200 officially sanctioned ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenue. And those awesome good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the guy who likes and comments on your face.
Finally, let's talk about the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o'-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
For us, luckily, "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" began last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving out these guards and not staying with them.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack-o-lantern slowly on its front porch probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you’re looking for additional loans, try Phone Tim and Susan Matisse in Napa, Calif., and above to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin.
"""It was decided that a postage stamp containing a photograph of Sachin should be issued during the pre-match presentation,"" the MCA said in a statement."
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
Apart from this, a special coin will be used for the toss which will be handled by MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page brochure containing articles related to Tendulkar and statements about him from the business, sports and journalism fraternity.
The limited number of these brochures and coins will be distributed to MCA and BCCI members, the association said.
He said that 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 caps will be distributed every day which will have Sachin's photographs.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point harness belts, as well as an intercom system.
Its options include upgraded brakes, service packages that provide access to the vehicle collection between bowler works mechanics, logistic support, and events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Rally customers coming into the bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure and a path that can lead to world-class events.
We are delighted to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format provides a new way to experience different rally modes in the UK and abroad, and prepares the contestant for the rigor and truth of the rally raid.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it's going to be a really fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenger will also offer an option to compete in the training and testing day in February, as well as desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The dream of the firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area was not realised.
The firecrackers are stuck in the Mazdar after the High Court order.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary firecracker market built at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licences for doing business in the transport area.
The commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on the deputy commissioner of Amritsar for not having proper arrangements.
In its order, the High Court has sharply reprimanded the administrative authorities of Amritsar for the work of which such an administration has not been able to solve even a single problem of firecrackers for nine years.
They could not find a suitable place in the city.
After this, the firecrackers were asked to issue licences for trading in the market at Shipgarh by making proper security arrangements.
Even though the firecrackers were happy with the order, their happiness was returned by the police on Friday.
A team of the realha licence branch of the police reached the firecracker market and sold the farm by putting a counter there.
It was impossible to complete the conditions which were given to them in one day.
ACP (East) Gaurav Garg, Aslha Licence Branch in-charge Anoop Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma and others reached the spot.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecrackers.
Hence, licences were not issued to firecrackers.
Diwali is just one day away.
Due to this, the traders are facing problems.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will sue the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry firecrackers took out a protest march from Shipgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
After this, the business in the floating firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue was also stopped.
A fire brigade was called to rescue a lost puppy at the mouth of a critical mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker spaniel ruby ran away after a short road collision
He was spotted by a dog walker trapped in the mine three days later
Firefighters pulled down the front part of the rock from the rope to save the dog from death.
After Papi somehow got stuck on the face of a troubled mountain 50 feet above the ground, the call to firemen gave him a happy life.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappie Mine in West Yorkshire to meet with Ruby again, and they have blessed the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away after a small accident, he searched like crazy for his lost dog, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, 50 feet above the ground, on a mountain in a mine.
A technical rescue team from the Clayheatan Fire Station rushed to the spot and lowered the rope to save Ruby and used a stomach tube to bring her down from the rock.
Andy Clayton, an expert technical rescue officer, said: “She was in a critical condition.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
She did not make a single move during the rescue, she was made of stone.
But now he's good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It's incredible to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby is fortunately survived."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see rescue work"
At first I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It's amazing to have him back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell down, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a very good job.
What they have done is truly remarkable.
We are very proud of them, and they are all great.
Mr. Alderson from Kigali also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade has done an excellent job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says when Katy Perry was 18, she didn't hit him
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the Pawn star said that he had sung backing vocals for Jaeger's 2004 song "Old Habit's Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with senior rocker, and ‘When I was 18, they hit me.’
"That thing got old, and he treats me well," he said.
The 70-year-old Jaeger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies ever striking Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Possibly Perry is saying about them in someone else's misunderstanding."
Perry was one of the singers who came as guests on Rolling Stone's Tour this year.
His new album "Prizm" reached the top spot this week.
George Keravan: Euro dissolution gave the Scots a choice
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom.
This time we have been warned that an independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
The passport control over Barwick and the barbed wire border on Hadrian's walls indicate stories.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - forecastedly - did not describe it in Headlines.
Nor did anyone describe how EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules to suit their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen area, Brussels will be an affordable discount for continued non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long is frozen. The first time I heard the "freedom means passport control" baseless news almost 40 years ago.
Still, the interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect independent Scotland to bid for Europe?
Why should London’s Yoke be bought and sold to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the EU, dedicated parties are gaining strength to oppose the EU or to close the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Alternative for Germany Party - founded this year - suddenly received nearly five million votes in the September federal election, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
The plan to build a federal Europe has always been a domestic opposition.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be radically transformative.
As well as the stringent regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think that Project Europe has gone too far due to the constraints placed on national economies through complying with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not have much of a role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in an inherent disadvantageous state of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public spending - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
European productivity is much deeper than the current budget and currency problems.
To provide concessions to French and German energy firms at consumer expense - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times for gas than the United Nations.
This is the crushing cost loss, which we have already seen in Granmauth.
Even if all the salaries in the world are frozen, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be saved from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, there has been a sense of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a way to keep Germany in control, and Paris as a means to provide the world with a billing equivalent to that of the British.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to falter.
Results: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won the recent by-election by pushing the ruling Socialist to third place.
The front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't walk away assuming the disruption for the left would automatically benefit the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his new found fame among French whites, the working class?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-monopoly bloc in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections then this type of coalition could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon the union of anti-EU and anti-universal currency sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not be completely exhausted, but it will return to a fragmented form of "Europe of (sovereign) nations" supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its following economies may maintain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of increasing its closeness with the US.
However, the growing interest of Vansigton in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What's next for Scotland?
We can choose to remain (necessarily) the territory of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic independence while walking the Norway route.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - has been the most successful anti-feminism political campaign in Europe, winning an astonishing majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dem coalition that opposed (and implemented) the cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the rules of frugality imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Childhood: Growing up too fast.
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls achieve puberty at a younger age than white girls.
Physical change does not mean that the youth is near.
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of puberty at a young age.
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Pat Etheridge, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts at the age of 7 or 8 and her genital hair begins to grow?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz made it clear that these early physical changes are common in American girls, a new trend.
“I spend a lot of time convincing parents — that generally it doesn’t show rapid progress toward full puberty,” says Caplovitz.
Direct signs of development such as breast spores, genitals and armpit hair and physical odors are seen prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of menopause (first menstrual period).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
“It takes at least two to three years in the first menopause when the breasts begin to develop,” explains Caplovitz, who is also the author of “Preterm puberty in girls: the necessary guide to dealing with this common problem.”
The most accurate test of the development of puberty is the time.
There is debate about what the onset of puberty is, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8 years two call it “child-adult.”
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - which can be closely monitored by a pediatrician.
In the event of rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to be examined to eliminate the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: premature ageing of the bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and stamina as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, “Suppression of youth can exacerbate behavioral issues, and girls may begin to feel isolated from their peers.”
The second big problem can be understood: parents simply don’t want their young daughter to have a menstrual cycle.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene,” Caplovitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruating at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and worried that her first menstrual cycle had begun in her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that hormone in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexually-oriented messages in the media can be blamed.
Boys - just like girls - are getting premature puberty.
Caplovitz sets the rule that the main cause of this is an outbreak of obesity.
She helped conduct studies on girls aged 6 to 9 in the year 2001, which linked body fat to the time of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty earlier than white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
On a global scale, the pattern of premature puberty seems to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of full puberty is not as clear as girls in them.
Other doctors who attended the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician endocrinologist at Goreeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician to get an opinion on how to talk to their children.
“This may mean negotiating ahead of the expected time,” advised Caplovitz.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond appropriately.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
On Thursday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 3.1 degrees Celsius.
On Wednesday night, the rain and cold winds made the people feel very cold.
On Sunday, people dressed in sweaters went to the markets and to their destinations.
During the first week of winter, people have also taken out the quilts.
In the morning, people were enjoying the sunshine.
As the weather changes, cold will also be a great relief from the disease, but after that, the sun continued to shine throughout the day.
The children also came to their school wearing sweaters.
The maximum temperature was recorded at 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum at 13.7 degrees Celsius, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).
The city received 7.8 mm of rainfall.
According to the Meteorological Department, the sky will remain cloudy.
Disputed for seat width from jet manufacturers to large orders at stake.
This month's Dubai Airshow has sparked a flurry of fights between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy focuses on the width of the economy class seat on long-haul flights, not always as provided by airlines, but whose allotted space efficiency has been claimed to be key by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and the Boeing Company.
Airbus is expecting such an industry standard to have a wide range of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin this week, but it should be fixed by the airlines, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute comes amid aircraft manufacturers when a large version of the twin engine of the long-range aircraft came to be sold from the potentially recorded order after the 17-21 incident.
How has the rear section of the aircraft been built - especially whether the seating is 9 or 10 equal to the design of mini jumbo jets, taking into account the high capacity claims?
Boeing says it has created a "777 X" that will put 406 people in the 17-inch-wide and 10 people in a row in the economic department.
Airbus says that competing with the A350, it will take 350 people into the 18-inch 9 equal seats.
Aircraft giants often strike trade deals on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X expected to dominate more than 100 orders in the Dubai Airshow, it is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that the Vigyapan war is beginning to be anything but this show to Finanero that all three of them together in a restaurant together, will you accept this?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "Boeing is also offering long-haul flights from regional turbos to narrower ones."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way the plane sits has not changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo ne modern long ki travel was defined, and the average American male aged 40-49 years increased by 10 percent.
According to American Health Statistics, the average American male waist is 39.7 inches in the 21st century.
Airbus says its rival sticks to a 1950s seat concept when the average circumference of the new name "Jet Set" was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent improvement in sleep quality in seat width.
Boeing disputed Airbus seat measurement data, saying it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fares and facilities.
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin more than the width of the seat.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Kraver said, “It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility and the things they believe they need to do to succeed.”
"They don't want to tell us what the benefits are."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's about the elbow room, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The dispute is estimated to be worth at least $700 billion in trade, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports in the coming decades.
Reuters reports that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a battle point between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed a 20 per cent performance per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Er, the leader of that segment in their new twin-engine design.
Boeing's claim to performance depends on the 10's 777's comparison with the original 9's 777's design.
10 is now used as a comparison with the profit in the unit cost.
Kevin Kensington, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility, says "This aircraft of Boeing is making our products more competitive, with more seats to occupy".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the current 777 S suggests that many passengers are in favor of the Denver layout, which can go with cheap fares as well.
"The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for travelers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of proposal 777," said cabin insider Marie Karby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet sellers around the world should also take precautionary measures to check on this layouts competition.
Resting more, all builders are also offering low-cost airlines and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10 equal A350 but says it's not sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus insisted on extensive cabin seats on some of its jet planes for the need for more cabin facility.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard, without the support of another manufacturer, but it could deviate from the 777 X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun that comes with smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which may take years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weil Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs were positive.
"We very much hope that the strategy of this type of vaccine can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available on the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction to nicotine, far more powerful than these existing methods," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which is designed to deliver genetic information aimed at making anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent the nicotine from growing inside the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the vaccinated mice who were later given nicotine continued their normal activities.
But the rat who was not vaccinated "feels good", the researchers say, was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be administered at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved costly and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children, before the temptation to try cigarettes, so that they can be protected from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by people who smoke to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again they will not enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the post-mortem, the actual cause of the tiger's death could not be ascertained.
The forest department has given a go-ahead in this regard, prima facie, describing the tiger's death as natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tiger near the Pawalgarh conservatory reserve khichdi drain.
All the organs of the dead body of the tiger were safe as well as there were no marks of any injury or injury etc.
The post-mortem of the body was conducted on Friday in the presence of forest conservator Vivek Pandey, CTR deputy director Saket Badola, DFO Kakasha Naseem, SDO GS Karki, CTR veterinarian Bharat and Kotabagh veterinarian Hema Rathore.
According to sources, the internal body of the tiger is said to be damaged during the post-mortem examination.
The exact cause of the death could not be ascertained.
On the death of the tiger, the departmental officials continued to give a befitting reply.
However, the internal organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for a topsychologic examination to confirm the poisoning.
Vivek Pandey, the conservator of forests, said the death of a tiger could be termed as natural.
No signs of poison etc. were found from the body of the tiger.
However, the area around it has been searched and a probe is underway to confirm the poisoning.
Tripods deny that we are being influenced by the Obsidian.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripody will be examined by the State Carpetson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to deny the marine leases that policy was at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obaid, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed investigations into whether Mr. Obaid had approached several state ministers for violation of the circulars of the Leases Policy, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid, were renewed without tender, after their expiry in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, the former Deputy Chief of Staff, after the evidence given on Thursday, alleged that Mr. Tripodi knew Mr. Obaid's hidden interests? is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had put pressure on the government to start public tenders for leases.
The leaseholders were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprise for leases, which made Obaid $25 million a year, was renewed from the tender without leases.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the minister of dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change at Mr. Obaid 's request, Mr. Tripodi had requested a change in the government' s lease policy
In August and September 2007, Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. Obaid’s Fisheries Department after working in the Ports Ministry
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely asked Mr. Tripodi. “Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case,?”
"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets have launched strikes in Syria.
Israeli warplanes targeted Syria's port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the motive was, but there was at least one motive.
The Associated Press reports that the target Russian missiles were SA-125.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas can undergo a “certificate” test
The government is considering a "certification" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to expand a rigorous process.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent the 457 used to fill in unskilled positions in Australia or to pass on to family and friends in a covert manner.
Condemning the government’s word count on foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McQueue today said it could anger Australia’s neighbours.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreigners are arriving at the end of the queue" and loud rhetoric about "Australians job first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labor market."
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been provided with protection - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the region had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about people smuggling, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "Authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined "whether the nomination is true under circumstances in which the nominee is the owner of the visa sponsor or the relevant person's relative or personal partner."
Businesses may need to keep a count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after coming on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distressed nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after his father's death on Wednesday, one of his adult cousins, who was on the same ship, has tied him up.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Works by HS2 indicate high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer told that the project "will make Britain one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "very excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include the new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider rail capacity for Northern England and Scotland and the possibilities of further improving travel times.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: “Our goal for HS2 is to have a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.”
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael to return Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown pointed out: “High-speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the case of high-speed rail throughout the UK.”
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to explore options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all, and meet the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the ministers of the British government next year and taking a decision together on the further course of action.
The aircraft's electrical equipment rules will remain in effect in Australia
Despite the softening of equipment-related regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers must continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to U.S. airline companies to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided the equipment remains in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this on many flights right now, but many people do not like being unable to access their e-book etc. while flying and landing.
Australian airline companies are considering the decision, according to which US airline companies will have to do a lot more to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at critical stages of flight are still effective in Australia.
“Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft,” the authority said, “the issue falls under regulations that require airline operators to ensure that the safety system is always fully in place, and that passengers must comply with safety instructions given by crew members.”
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is set to follow this change, but she asked for further action on the regulator's directive.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel it will provide customers with a better experience, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would follow current rules right now.
"According to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. allergens.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each U.S. airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as modify their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and briefs to passengers.
The FAA said it would allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes after the airline verifies their aircraft's endurance.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during landing.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely placed under the seat or in the upper compartments while flying and landing.
Silver of Pondbrokers due to perceived difficulty by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by giving her gold bangles, rings and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees at a pawnshop at the Bendmeier shopping centre in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, “My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it.”
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is on the rise - with ValueMax becoming the third pan-shop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Mortgage jewellery isn't the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in Ms. Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Generally in Singapore, Ponnbrokers charge 17 per cent per annum, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender that has branches in the same shopping center.
However, Pondbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and they can provide loans more quickly than banks.
Millions of people in the region are turning to the Pon Shop due to the difficulty faced by families due to rising cost of living and increase in domestic and consumer loans.
After five years of strong growth following the global financial crisis, and a simple monetary policy in developed economies, after cheap credit, low- and middle-income families are turning to PonShop to meet their needs due to the slowdown of their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard's Ange Poors, described rising domestic profits mainly due to rising mortgages as a risk factor for Asian banks' indebtedness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt ratio in Asia, it said.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP as against 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged mildly from the tech meltdown this week.
On Thursday, data showed a sustained export slowdown and a decline in consumer demand.
“The decisive point is that with rising prices, people from the middle to lower classes [of the income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way,” said Song Seung-won, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
The historically high values in gold values over the past two years have led people to pledge personal assets, as they take advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family’s jewellery.
In Singapore, gold accounts for 70 per cent of the mortgaged items in the city-state's 200-pon outlets.
People are saying, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge the grandmother's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Ejimani, Thailand's largest panshop operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
There is so much growth in the mortgage business that the operators of the outlet in Bendimir, Valuemax and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighborhoods, in Malaysia where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yah Lee Ching, executive director of Valuemax.
The company will fund it using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders (lenders) have been criticised due to higher interest rates, Ms. Yah says that mortgages not only get cheaper rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase the loan.
"Customers pledge items they already have, and cashing out personal assets does not increase domestic debt," she says.
Social acceptance of Ponnbroking for short-term and secure financial assistance is on the rise.
It’s not that punbrokers are only used by financially weak people.
In Singapore, wealthy people also use valuemax outlets, pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can pay up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all sections of society.
“These include wealthy individuals who need a short-term loan for business ventures or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements,” says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani are celebrating their 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a big party on the occasion.
Many Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party. On the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching a flight to Jodhpur at the Mumbai airport.
The film stars Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapur, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, among others.
Of course, you can imagine how big the water will be when such a big name joins the party.
A $325 million rescue package for the health of the Taji
The union government has insisted that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system is also tied to strict conditions that will ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibbersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The four-year funding decision was made after consultations with the government of independent Tasmania MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the particular challenges the state is facing," she said.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgery plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving past aggregation cases.
It also includes funds for a walk-in clinic at Hobart and Lawnsetts, better after-hospital care, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of a personal electronic health record system at local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the best practices I’ve been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania’s health system,” Ms. Plibarsek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government will face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report each month where additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be constituted to ensure that the service is provided by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said the $325 million would not mean much, “unless real reforms are made to bring Tasmania’s public health system to a more sustainable level.”
Yet he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.”
“I hope the federal aid package will be very helpful in separating the state-republic health system from the crisis-hit list,” Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will primarily undo the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."
"We are here for this reason because the Labor State government has taken $430 million into its health system," he told ABCTV.
You can’t count the state government taking about half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving 300 million dollars as a day of good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibbersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel by Giloum Nichols has a description of the best production design and the time period, but it has become much more than it should have been.
The novel, which dates back to 1760 in France, tells the tragic story of Sujan, a young nobleman who is sent by his family to Convent.
When she revolts, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluptuous paranoid Mother Superior, and becomes the object of erotic attraction for the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensations - and that's the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narrative, there is also a risk of making a boring film for the audience.
CSA Vice Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose entry fee in the garden due to the garbage spread in the garden.
At the same time, a 15-day ultimatum has been given to rectify the situation of the departments.
The vice-chancellor made a surprise inspection of the seed and field and director research with the garden department at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees in these departments, including the director, out of his seat.
After being reprimanded, he warned of a pay cut next time he was found absent.
Dr Naushad Khan, the media in-charge of the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 will have to be made for a month-long tour.
People will be able to walk in the garden at a fee of one rupee per day.
The system will work: files pertaining to various functions in front of the Vice Chancellor will be accessed under one system.
Not every employee will have the right to enter the Vice Chancellor's office with his file.
The concerned officials will reach out to their final Vice-Chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to build chemical weapons.
The group, which monitors Thursday, said Syria has destroyed vital equipment to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while fierce clashes erupted in northern Syria, which is very close to where toxic agents are believed to be kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian movement group said about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) comes a day before the November 1 deadline
The Hague-based organization set out to decommission or destroy all chemical weapons production units and chemicals in toxic gases, and machinery used to fill war materials.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, in particular, is a significant milestone in this ambitious development that aims to destroy all of Dumska's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damaskus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came at a time of heightened conflict in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The movement group, which keeps track of the number of deaths through its network of movements in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
The government said 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad’s military, 18,678 were fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said the dead included 2,202 army absconders and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this conflict, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's army fought rebels in Safara for several weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties from both sides, but did not say anything explicitly.
This war reflects the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons who, in a very short time frame, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team "has just been satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared significant production and mixing/filling equipment - destroyed."
It also said, “No further inspection activity is being planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of the confirmation process by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by the Dumschus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres due to security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers "have been abandoned and... chemical weapons products placed there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where inspectors of OPCW were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
"I salute the resilience and courage displayed by you people in completing the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,"" said Ahmet Uzumku, Director General of the Monitoring Group in a statement released by OPCW."
The three-year civil war is mainly a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, including members of the Shi'ite sect, as well as Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a powerful explosion at the Air Defense Center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered a laptop, a laptop and a photocopy of the fake registry from the possession of the accused.
The police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the accused have been identified as Rajeev Agarwal alias Bindtu of Chandra Nagar, Kamal Krishan Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gagi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of Registrar Office (East) fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused along with the clerk and recordkeeper of the registrar office, Balbir Singh, used to extract papers from the records of vacant and old lands and then buy new stamp papers and prepare a forged registry on them.
Not only that, the original registry would disappear and the forged registry would be placed in the record.
Thereafter, the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on forged papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these forged papers.
After this, the real owner of the land used to be under the shock of the police and administration.
The accused, who had got the forged registry prepared, were keeping a close watch on the NRIG lands.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said the accused told during interrogation that they have prepared around 150 forged registers so far.
According to the police, a case of cheating and theft has been registered against Rajiv.
Controversy over the execution of a bomb blast plotter in Bali
The families and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombings have expressed anger over the punishment given to the mastermind of the bombing, saying that Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who ran away as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men for nearly 10 years, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosive device used in the bombing.
If parole is granted, he can be released in 15 years.
Umar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many others.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings at a church in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could also demand that the man, known as the infamous "destructive man" who made the bomb, be executed.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of June Cortin, a woman living in Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack carried out by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Withholding his tears, he said that Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel he should have been punished like the other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Cortin told the AAP, “She should be put in front of the firing squad.”
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the club's name was erased after a bomb exploded in a loaded van parked outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the paediatric bar when a bag packed with explosive material was detonated just 20 seconds before the suicide bombers.
He went into a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and died three times while on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment that three other members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terror group responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra - were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
You see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding countless others, a 20-year sentence is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of bomb blasts.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore contacts between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
“She didn’t surrender,” Ms. Cortin says.
Even to this day, the pain of hurting so many people is not really there.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Ms. Cortin said.
Patek can still appeal against his conviction.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in aircraft (but cannot call from cell phones)
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music, from entering the gate to getting off the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - as part of the highly-anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect this change immediately.
At a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said that how fast these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meets the new guidelines, and how they are updating the training manuals and rules for the collection of their crew members and devices to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
The FAA said in a statement, "Depending on the status of the plan, we may very quickly approve the extended use of electronic devices."
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected not to turn on the aircraft till it reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when they land, and not turn it on until the aircraft is fully decommissioned.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use the device when they fly, when they land and when they are taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
“When the policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with airlines companies to do so – it will be a win-win for both sides,” Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we're bored with feeling like "Hall Monitors."
But surfing by connecting to the Internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversations with friends, online games like Scrabble, the famous phenomenon associated with which is that in 2011, when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while he was at the airport at the gate, and American Airlines dropped him off the plane after he refused to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment, such as laptops, etc., will still have to be collected because their bounce will worry about hurting the other person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Mark Rosencon of the National Transportation Safety Board last month, who is the CBS News' national transport safety expert, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, not just because they can potentially disrupt navigation-related devices, but also because they can disrupt cell phone towers when they are in the air," Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to probe the issue has recommended last month that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
The FAA has been under increasing pressure in recent years to reduce restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, have stated that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
These restrictions are becoming even more difficult to enforce because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that nearly a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when reports of disruption to navigation and communication equipment were received due to the carrying of FM radios and high-tech gadgets by passengers at the time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
The modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huarta said most airlines must meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less power radio transmission than previous generation electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a fairly nominal transmission during page turn.
But transmissions prevail when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been among those favored to ease restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded its entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but found no such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association said he believes the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device being disrupted in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order the passengers to turn off the device at the time of landing in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common-sense facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said: "We are delighted that the FAA has recognized that traveling with joy is not incompatible with passenger, rescue and safety.
Learning from the series of bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police is gearing up for the celebration of Diwali in the wake of security and quick reaction during emergency situations.
A total of 1,800 constables, including vehicles and pedestrians, will patrol all the main points of the city, crowded markets and other places to arrest the perpetrators of other incidents, including smooth running of traffic, prevention of incidents of snatching, teaching lessons to the people.
Women police personnel including PCR, traffic unit will be part of these jawans.
Police personnel and commandos at hotels, guest houses and other places in the city, including the PG, will also carry out a vigilance check and record check.
The SHO has been directed to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the matter.
Apart from this, the DSP has been entrusted with the responsibility of checking the markets, malls and other places, including the VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the higher authorities have also fixed additional police personnel in police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police, along with the director of the fire department and the principal director of the PGI, the director of the DHS and the staff of the other dispensaries, including the Sector 16 GMSH and the Sector 32 GMCH management, have been asked to remain on high alert in case of an emergency.
To teach a lesson to the Manchalans, the departmental officers have now hired women police personnel and others under the NGO's leadership as 'Anti-Gunda Staff'.
Police personnel of the Anti-Gunda Staff Team will be camping in plain clothes at crowded places, including markets.
On Diwali, all the SHOs have been ordered to install 44 nakas in the interiors of the city.
Police personnel will also be deployed at 38 naka points on the city's borders.
The bird was released back into the wild by air transport to protect it from the North Sea Rig.
The bird found stranded on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released back into the wild from the coast by air transport.
The bird, named Water Rail, was flown to Aberdeen by a helicopter before the Scottish SPCA recovered back to their rescue centre in Eloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon explained: “This water train was probably the winter migratory bird of Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that this bird was tired and he took refuge on the oil rig.
He further explained that: “It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help.”
Before leaving, the water rail had become healthy and fit.
Is Europe’s upper class ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring the business together and determine what changes the UK employment and prosperity creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of the UK business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1,000 business leaders representing the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU member states are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not engage in a long-term and vicious process of reform of the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas, such as from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
While general dissatisfaction with the single market could easily be seen, businesspeople say that the price of regulation in Brussels far outweighs the benefits of being part of Europe's trading region - even 40 percent of the huge businessmen who traditionally favored European companies agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wanted Britain to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
The findings, which were seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are driven by a "meaningful change" that would give the UK its lost power back.
It has a very high price – a treaty change for Britain and the issue of getting a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote, in the referendum, in favor of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey states that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate the terms of UK's membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate the current balance of power by making a meaningful change in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly imperative, as the eurozone moves forward towards a closed economy and a fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses, this means a new focus on business and fundamental changes in the regulation practices of Brussels.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom described the pipeline as the beginning of a new era in Bulgaria
The beginning of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.
“Today is a historic event: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will provide diversification of Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said a dispute over a contract between Gazprom's Counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where Russia holds most of its gas to Europe, presents a risk to conventional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant an "forever" end to the gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
After the entire project is operationalized in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, hearing by Royal Commission
Two employees of the YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offences before they were charged with carrying out child care at Caringbah Child Care Worker Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in its statement before the commission, it said it had "never reported a case of child sexual abuse inside its organisation", the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which YMCA Carringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr Hare, a lawyer who assisted the commission, said he was aware of the first case, but did not know about the second.
He also admitted that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that "YMCA has been externally examined and has found YMCA to be at the forefront of child protection" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it achieved the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is 21 years of age with YMCA, admitted that the reason for the Lord's appointment was a failure of management "including myself," and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations related to reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 children during a two-year term at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years imprisonment.
But Mr Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the staff did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the breach was evidence that included Lord spending time alone with the children, getting them babysitting privately, putting them on the lap, telling them that he loved them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's supervision, and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Y.M.C.A. Caringbah, Lord's supervisor, had been "very intimidating and difficult to get most of the time."
The CEO stated that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
She said, rather her friendship with the Lord led her to mislead her decision to inform about him.
Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW Board that, from the "Jonathan Lord incident" the text was "about not giving information" to the organization.
Mr. Hare said that soon after the allegations surfaced, the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees was taken by Liam Whiteley, YMCA’s Child Services Manager.
He said it was intended to avoid the blending of evidence, but it was "excited" and not executed correctly.
Stephen Smallbone, special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said the YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the appointment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes there is no chance of a comeback.
In a night-long interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, the 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and peacekeepers of the Middle East group.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister's post, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper, saying: "Yes, of course, but that's unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When there was a crowd of experts performing horses for the best horse of the year in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school yet and a few months away from taking his first step, this little boy and his pet Shetland's pony taffy easily completed three stages and won the top prize - leaving behind his 30 adult competitors.
At the annual competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudri, near Cardiff, the irresistible pair - which is the same length - was highly praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
In front of the men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, she slanted her flat hat at a slanted angle and circled her two-year-old toffee around the ring.
The decision makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee received the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given a toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has practiced with this pony from Shetland daily ever since.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are a fantastic pair."
He faced the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most unique in this arena, he found everyone so amazing that they wanted to take a photo with him.
The little boy from Nantigo village near Ab Well, South Wales, is walking on the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: “The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was cheering and clapping.”
He was running on sand all over the countryside, and despite looking so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is an animal lover – she loves horses, tractors, and farm, and she has raised two chickens that she takes care of.
The way he's started, he'll be at the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I'm sure he'll perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his pony.”
They are a very good couple.
The decision-makers gave points considering the manner in which Fenton and Toffee performed and how they performed in the show ring.
He saw good team work between the pony and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m pretty sure Fenton’s cute clothes helped him, he really looked very different.
The "revival" of the Chinese newspaper will be argued
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
The New Express newspaper in Guangzhou had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that, Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write a fabricated story about the state-owned company.
The regulator said that the new Express now has to go through a "complete correction."
The "correction" order came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group published a lot of false news about the listed company Jumlaion in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was cluttered," the regulator said in a statement.
It said it had decided to impose "an administrative penalty by cancelling Chen Yongzhou's reporter's license."
It had "instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete overhaul of the New Express, recommending that the New Express investigate those responsible for it and immediately revise the New Express' leadership team."
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Jumlaion.
After he was impeached, his newspaper published two home page appeals for his release, saying it supports Mr Chen's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen came on state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Jumlaion as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realised my mistakes.
Following Mr Chen's apology, the New Express issued a cover apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
In recent times, many high-profile suspects have confessed to the TV broadcasts.
Experts say that from time to time there is a forced conviction, despite the fact that a law in the latter part of this year prohibited the authorities from forcing a person to blame themselves.
National President of Anti-Terrorism Front, Maninderjit Singh Bitta, along with 10,000 children, will recite the text of Hanuman Chalisa at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar bypass on November 23.
This information was given to the gathering after an invitation was extended by Shri Hindu Justice Bench Chief Spokesperson Pravin Dang and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma.
He appreciated the efforts made by Shri Hindu Nyay Bench to connect children with Sanatan culture.
He said that religious education, including secular education, is also necessary for the unity and integrity of the country.
U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel finds its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S.A. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot-tall three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel is about the same length as a six football pitch, connecting the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being drug-filled.
Officials said it was closed before a drug passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
The three men, who officials said were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing it.
If convicted, he could face a jail term ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of the vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered since Central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, posing a challenge to drug mafia groups capable of delivering the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found a route of about 700 yards equipped with rail tracks, stretching from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to the San Diego warehouses.

British police send extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "submission notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, adding that he would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sexual offences charges, and his options under British law lapsed when the Supreme Court turned down his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand him over to the U.S., fearing he had requested asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had “sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, which required him to be present at the police station on the date and time we selected him.”
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited to the United States from Sweden to face possible espionage charges, due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks.
<0xC2><0xA3>1000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) fine for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs
The driver has been fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by placing a hot drink between the legs.
Tiptree, Essex's 35-year-old Andrew Howie was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink of their feet.
Howie has pleaded guilty to negligent driving in the Colchester Magistrates Court.
Seven points were added to his license, resulting in him being banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>90) and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>100).
Tax on foreign property owners will put an end to London's artificial status
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who had introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million in the 2012 Budget and for individuals who prefer to own a house in a company instead of a separate one.
The stamp duty on residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in 2012/13 was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr Cook pointed out: “After the increase in stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property has a reasonably low tax, which has nothing to do with the influence of the old council tax system.
“But this move is silent on some foreign investors buying property in London and may make current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prime Property, the top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market by value in wealthy south-west London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8 percent last year.
According to Savile's research, prices in central London continued to grow at a regular rate of 5.6 percent each year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic market", as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) saw a surge.
Scientists have further shed light on the topic of what is the relationship between dog tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while restless dogs move their tail more to the left primarily.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and react to it.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
“In humans it’s all well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved differently in the stimulus that generates positive or negative emotions,” explained neuroscientist Professor Georgia Velartigra from the University of Trento.
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that, like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for left-handed movements and the opposite order, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral sneezing by other dogs, researchers tracked down animals watching other dog movies.
They measured the heart beats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take long to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side or on the other.
Prof. Vellartigra pointed out: “We introduced dogs with dog movies – in the realistic version or in the shadow-picture to deal with other issues that were confusing, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw a helpless dog moving its tail to the right (with a dog's sight), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail turning to the left (from the dog's point of view) primarily, their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these acts.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what actions they should be concerned about and not on what.
He said: “If you’ve met other dogs many times, and if they constantly move their tails to one side it’s related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
Researchers say these findings can provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with better information about animal emotions.
John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, they reported: “Unlike the Italian study – when the tail of a robot dog moved to the left rather than to the right, dogs were more likely to approach it rather than be restless.”
He said that this difference was due to the fact that in various studies dogs did not fully understand dogs as dogs in movies.
He explained that studying how dogs react to real dogs in it can help.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be obtained - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems likely that it will not take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side or the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
A rock bank named Arctic Monkeys has postponed gigs in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered a concussion.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But his lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to re-evaluate the show's date.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were forced to postpone gigs in the same manner at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the show tonight at the Birmingham LG Arena after medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
“The investigation found Alex Turner to be congested, and he’s sadly not capable of performing.”
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now be held on November 20, and the show at Glasgow Hydro will be held on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused to all ticket holders.
For any other assistance, contact the customer service at the box office where you purchased the tickets.
Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make the Catholic Church's new cardinal for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking pastors in the Catholic Church, whose rank is only below the Pope, and these people choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of individuals who will ultimately help him choose his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals there at present.
By the way, Cardinals are not allowed to participate in the pope's election after reaching the age of 80 - they fall into the group of 120 "Cardinal Electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardy said that before the ceremony to promote the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which is called the papal assembly.
“Pope Francis has decided to inform in advance of his decision to hold the Pope-Council of February, to make it easier to plan other meetings involving Cardinals from different countries of the world,” Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease by February.
In general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the number of cardinals, and the names of cardinals over the age of 80 as they wish, he said.
Valero said the next year's papal meeting would be important because it would be the first papal meeting since Francis was elected in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new popes also nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of South America has Roman Catholics, but their number in the cardinals is very small.
The Cardinals Council by Francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to find ways to reform the church - will also be the first cardinals to be elected after being formed.
Before that, the Pope had to decide everything on his own.
“Right now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "possible" for Francis to seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's completely new.
Valero said that generally the pope gives the bishops of large places the post of cardinal, but Francis was "totally surprised - so we don't know whose name they'll announce."
GM Calls Back Pickup Trucks in U.S. to Correct Seatbacks
General Motors has recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a shortage of hand-drawn seatbacks in its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, according to an information from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.
In some trucks there may be a decrease in the front seat rotating system.
As a result, the union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding the seatback, head restraint.
According to an information posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, "if the vehicle is stuck in the back, it is possible that the headrest may not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks started being shipped in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, it marks the most important Wahhan launch for the top U.S. automaker.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The NSTMA could not review the notification letter due to a 16-day government shutdown, which disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
GM sold 42,660 silverados and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks in October.
On Friday afternoon, GM shares were up 1.4 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange.
The disappointment of Obama's voters.
I've voted for Obama twice.
He says that Obamas great efforts have been hampered by the GOPs blocking policy
Obamacare website woes, drone attacks cannot be excused
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a lot of sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during my second year of medical school and give me a ray of hope.
It’s called “The Courage to Win,” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I wake up at night from my patient’s slips and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of that time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A group of young visionary men were on their way to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
Obama had an 82% approval rating when he became president in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, as if coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
There was a real change after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, I could not imagine any of it.
I owe a lot of achievements to Obama, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask" and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the policy of partisan opposition has prevented many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public options for healthcare, closing bases on Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the number of times in which I took myself to the side of the Obama administration in front of colleagues and colleagues, I have an answer that I can give them.
I have come to the point of political disappointment.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency storing data about the private lives of ordinary U.S. citizens, nor can it respond to prosecutions of people exposing government wrongdoing.
This cannot be the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar El Awlaki without trial, nor the reduction of public funds and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says that the White House’s efforts to silence the media have been “the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it cannot afford to fail to design a simple website even three years after it was signed into law by the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I was expecting that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is apparent that the elected office is not a predictable path, as opposition political parties and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet most of the examples I have given above seem to have been chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you the most.
I re-voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice that did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I thought a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we’ve long heard of.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is below 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to the year 2008 through that book.
When I look at him, I remember his lost words.
This week a section of the book was reading, describing how Clinton did not suffer a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain loyal to their objectives.
"I want to get my mojo back," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years later today, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Claims PM Tony Abbott's Interest Conflict About Parental Leave Plan
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral holiday plan is a conflict of interest as his daughters can get pregnant and take advantage of it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while attempting to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining whether to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the interests of ministers can be a conflict, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from policies.
“He can have a significant interest conflict in terms of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get a leave,” Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a renaissance of the counting of votes to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters Franz and Bridget.
Should the results of the election come two months after the vote we cast?
"We should have a better system," he said.
Why can’t we have a system in which we fill out our dissection on the computer, vote immediately and have results at 6:30 in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballot papers.
This is because, if a person does not like it, he can erase it?
In today's time, using pencils seems completely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint consultation paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new work "very seriously."
Public office is for public service.
“We don’t want any other award other than the award of history that we can serve the community at this crucial time,” he said.
This caused inconvenience to the litigants.
Addressing a public meeting on the occasion, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anguish over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said the increasing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that the criminals have become fearless.
They have no fear of the police and the administration.
Referring to the recent incidents in different places, he said that when the lawyer society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily guessed.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, the case learned from two people, another sign that the global investigation by regulators into suspected manipulation of the currency market is moving at a fast pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in their investigations into the world's largest financial market in which $5.3 trillion is exchanged each day.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the probe proceeds in the case that appears to be a recurrence of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, “Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators.”
Last month, people familiar with the case said RBS had sent emails and records of instant messages sent and received from the former trader to the UK Regulatory and Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from his current position as the European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
According to experts in the case, Mr. Usher's instant messaging group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after the Swiss regulator, FINMA, was informed that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, the Competition Authority of Finland, the Competition Authority of Switzerland, the VCO, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations that bankers have been mishandled for their favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
People familiar with the case said HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks are closely examining instant messages and emails equivalent to several years in search of clues to a wrong activity.
The news about the investigation has created a stir among traders in such an area, who have been among the top earners in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, as low volatility in the currencies has reduced the opportunities for bookmakers.
Some bankers tried to stifle the case by saying that it was impossible to manipulate a very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use of their own platforms by banks, despite the extremely large volume of forex buying and selling, meant that "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced the Trader was to be serviced this week from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London, which reported a loss of about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
“We believe the trader acted alone, and has been controlled,” said Credit Suisse.
Students studying technical and management courses on the campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The university vice-chancellor has written a letter to the governor seeking permission to hold elections.
With the start of the admission process at the university, the demand for holding of student union elections began.
To reach out to the university administration and college management, he had also launched a signature campaign on the selection of his representative.
Students taking admission in nearly two dozen courses, including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science, will be able to choose their representatives this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will get the opportunity to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice-Chancellor Prof Ashok Kumar said that the Governor has sought permission to hold elections in the university.
The date of the elections will be announced once the permission is granted.
"""It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many college managements do not want student union elections to take place on their campus.
At the same time, due to lack of unity among the students, elections are also not being held.
The Council had launched a signature campaign for the election.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Convenor ABVP
After Diwali, the district administration will seek permission to hold elections in colleges.
There is also a lack of clarity on the university's decision.
People have bought a lot of gold and silver from utensils in the capital on Dhanteras.
Such purchases have increased by 20-30 per cent compared to the previous year
A large number of people gathered at jewellery shops in Shimla.
A large crowd was also seen in the utensils shops decorated from the lower market to the Mall Road.
Although this year the price of such items was eclipsed, people still did not show any weakness in making purchases on the auspicious occasion.
On Friday, the auspicious occasion for shopping was from 7:52 am to 10:12 pm and from 1:56 pm to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm.
During the said three Muhurats, a large number of people gathered in the suburbs, including Shimla, for more shopping.
In Shimla lower market, there was no place for people to dharna.
The same goes for every small shop.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Dhanteras of the Krishna Paksha of the Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which would require citizens to purchase or punish health insurance before 2014 that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Roberts supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also upheld the remaining 2,700 pages of the law, saying that the condition of the healthcare law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states and the National Independent Business Federation to stop the legislation.
The legislation was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates during the opening session of 2012, including project nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that our work cannot be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to assume everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the day of Krishna Triyodashi in the month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshipped as Kuber, the god of wealth and Yamraj, the god of death.
Money has an important place in our lives.
No money is good.
We have a bad attitude towards money.
There is nothing more valuable than the wealth that comes from the well-being of humanity, but the wealth that causes arrogance makes no sense.
Let us make money with a holy purpose and spend it with a holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
There must also be a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to accumulate unaccounted wealth or to make money in the form of yen - can - idem destroys our conscience and personality.
The spirit of giving should always remain in the mind.
Even a fraction of the money you give can become the basis of one's livelihood.
We should all think for many people in society who are living in a terrible lack.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the malefactors of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and success, and according to their effort, they also get money and success.
It is the wealth that is associated with honor.
No matter how rich a criminal is, he can neither consume it properly nor benefit others.
Do not give money to someone else if you have money.
The true wealth is the one who makes the way into the innumerable hands of wealth.
There can be no better use of money than the creation of jobs for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of that money.

The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed that there was a fraud in the PMT of 2012 a day earlier.
The STF has found irregularities in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
Of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be cancelled.
Following the STF's disclosures, the medical education department has started a brainstorming to cancel the admissions of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting to meet the STF list of all these suspected students.
A list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
Departmental officials say that since it has been a year for students who took admission in the year 2012, it is necessary to seek legal advice in this case.
As the matter is now confined to the STF probe, the officials of the medical education department are in no position to say anything.

Aijaz Jan, MLA from Poonch constituency, inaugurated the water cooler at the Gurdwara premises.
The MLA said a large number of people come and go in the gurdwara, but due to lack of proper drinking water system, water coolers have been installed here.

Clean water will be available during the winter season.
This will solve the problem of drinking water for the devotees.
Members of the Gurdwara Committee and others were also present on the occasion.
After the general elections, if the new government continues its policy to stop the sale of kerosene through ration, then kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where the sale of kerosene will be stopped are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, the sale of kerosene is also going to be stopped in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the northeast.
According to sources in the petroleum ministry, the decision will be taken to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two basis.
The first is the rapid power connection being built in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS Kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural households have been given cooking gas connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has made elaborate preparations in this regard.
The sale of PDS Kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced considerably in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota for Punjab has been reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to 1 lakh kg.
Haryana's kerosene quota has been reduced by nearly 40 per cent while Uttarakhand's allocation has been reduced by 70 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of kerosene shortages from these states.
The ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene is being used for adulteration.
The price difference between PDS Kerosene and diesel is currently Rs 37.
This gives a boost to those who indulge in it.
In states where the sale of PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are incurring a loss of more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
In 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore.
The accused used to open the accounts of the investors by referring to the trading firm and fraudulently in the name of buying and selling the shares.
This is probably the first time in the state that such revelations have come to the fore in the amount of crores of rupees.
The police have not been able to reach him yet, but seven people, including the accused, who had seen his work in the state, have been detained by the police.
The gang operated a fake commodity market called Metatrader 5.
The promoters of the company used to take cash from investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
This was seen by the investors buying shares of the accused when they were trading.
It was then that he realized what price he was going to buy.
In fact, no shares were bought and no transactions were made for it, as no demat account of investors was opened and shares were shown to be false on this fake software.
Police suspect that hundreds of people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
Each investor was required to invest between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh in the name of making a profit.
While its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, his six other accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this, the company can trade shares to investors through its own.
Then the demat account of the investor is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but this company called MetaTrader 5 was neither associated with any exchange nor did it conduct stock trading.
The company bought the server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been fooled in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight Indore-based traders have come forward to lodge a complaint with the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, their amount was not transferred to the account.
He then started asking the company's shareholders for a profit.
Investors are even saying that on the fake ID given to them, the price of their purchased shares was always shown less.
The accused used to fix the price at their own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Agents advised people to join the company by lured more profits.
After this, up to two lakh rupees would be deposited from someone and up to five lakh rupees from someone.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) is earning crores of rupees every day at the gate of the city circle office building.
In such a situation, all the employees are forced to work in fear of accidents.
There is an atmosphere of fear among the staff who work due to the cement falling from the roofs of this building.
Built in the British era in 1913, this building had the office of the first municipal corporation.
The building was handed over to the Electricity Board in 1995.
In the name of its repair, the department is doing a lot of work by doing a color  pathology.
The condition of the building has become so bad that employees are afraid to sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that the plaster often falls from the roof.

BJP<0x60>s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election rally in Pune to inaugurate a section of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital.
"""In many states and at the Centre, sometimes there is a coalition government, sometimes there is a Congress government, sometimes there is a communist government, sometimes there is a BJP government,"" Modi said."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the team do?
If there is a comparable result, then the question will not come before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever and wherever the BJP government is formed, efforts have been made to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the low inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had two meals.
But when the Congress or its supporting government was formed, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is responding to what has been done in nine-and-a-half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even respond to the media.
Elections are Lok Sabha elections and you have to answer to the people.
Congress leader Kapil Sibal said, “Questions are being asked to Modi on this day. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, they will present their accounts before the people every year.
In a democracy, a servant should sit, not a ruler in Delhi.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only Das.
Friends of the Congress party are leaving the balloons for the day.
Friends, we have given the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people are accountable.
An economic lawsuit has been filed against Google, Samsung and Huawei in the case of Nortel patents.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, has filed numerous patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone makers, which it beat in the Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
Rockstar, a consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The lawsuit said the patents also include technology that combines words searched on the Internet with relevant advertising, which is a core part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be immediately contacted.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased the bid several times and eventually proposed $4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar in the Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had a long list of patents.
"Despite losing the bid to acquire patents-in-suits at the auction, Google has violated, and continues to violate," the lawsuit said.
Rockstar has sought enhanced compensation against Google for alleged infringement of Google's patents.
Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi has been sworn in, but his victory day hardly ended the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted 16 months ago, promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president.
On his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president, and Egypt's fifth president since the monarchy was removed nearly 60 years ago.
He was sworn in on his chair in front of 18 judges dressed in black, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and another Republic," Morsi said during a formal ceremony shown live on national television.
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organization, and which has been the target of previous governments, said 60-year-old Morsi, a trained engineer in the U.S. of the party, “today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – full independence, true democracy and stability.”
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Since Mubarak's time, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new president, with traffic being halted for a while, so that his motorcade would leave the normally busy road that connects the city centre with its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal reputation, ridiculed as the Brotherhood's non-character "empty tire," grew after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him as a candidate not only for the Islamists but for all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against the dictator Mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi, sitting in a wooden panel chamber, took the oath of office before the judges, saying that "Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation today."
Morsi then moved to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by the military band playing the national tune while they stood in a cautious posture.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture hall at the main university there were greeted with the slogan "Army and people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a bastion of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and vowed to take back the president's powers taken away from him by the military council from the leader who was removed last year.
But traditionally by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court rather than the competent oath of Parliament they would bow before the will of the Army, which is a sign that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases U.S. spying has crossed the line.
He also claimed that innocent people were not tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.

I assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in an attempt to obtain information, improper methods have been adopted in some cases.
Meanwhile, a key committee of the US Congress has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust among people that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
The move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also broken into data centers of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on the NSA by 4 votes to 11 against.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapping under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, the deliberate unauthorised collection of data and its use will be considered an offence and a provision of 10 years imprisonment has been made for this.
The bill will become law after it is passed by both the houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate.
"""The NSA's phone recording program is in accordance with the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country,"" said committee chairman and Senator Diane Festin."
But there should be more transparency.
The safety of the people should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill, angered by the NSA's disclosure of its internet surveillance program.
In a letter to the senators, the companies said they welcome the proposal of the lawmakers who have curbed the NSA's large-scale phone recordings.
It is worth noting that documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden have removed the cover from the NSA's actions.
The NSAs telephonic surveillance of 35 countries, including Germany and France, has sparked outrage in the international community.

The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full-year pre-tax underlying profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to the previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.

A recent media report has said that the NSA blew up information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post made the disclosure on the basis of documents gathered from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was named Muscular, which it ran in collaboration with its British counter-part-GCHQ.
Both the agencies stole data that passes through the vast fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document from January 9, 2013 as saying that more than 180 million documents were collected in just three days of the program's launch.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run the program outside the US because such campaigns in the US require court orders.
"NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, ""As far as I am aware, this has never happened."
The NSA has always collected all the information within the ambit of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the U.S. administration has assured not to monitor its communications system.
The US has also said that the UN's communications system is not monitored.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's close aide Amit Shah were among those who attended the ceremony.
The programme was attended by district president Jainendra Kumar, national convener of non-traditional energy sources Krishna Kumar Singh, Nawada's Hisua MLA Anil Singh, Anil Swamy, Shyama Singh, Mukesh Kumar among others.
District President Kumar said that the family members of Shah reached the Shaktipeeth Maa Kamakhya Temple in Assam by offering prayers at the airport in a special flight.
From there, he directly took the steps of Shakti Peeth Maa Mangala Gauri.
After offering prayers at the Vishnupada temple, he left on a special flight.
District President Kumar said that due to security reasons, Mr Shah's Gaya programme was not made public.
The schools were keen to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage greater reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be discontinued.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects to undergo a revolutionary transformation.
It will also change the other main topics next year.
In a separate step, the Exam Regulators will demonstrate the changes in the structure of GCSEs with an offical, new grading system, and shorter curriculum.
Speaking in the summer, Secretary of Education Michael Gove said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore people's trust", adding that "GCSEs will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to math - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours a week during the session than most countries.
According to the comparison, Australian schools offer students an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there would be no formal requirement to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that combining the subjects with the GCSE - League table for overweight was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools.
This course will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The apex court said it cannot ask the media not to report information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called as Dracula in this case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
To this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments in such a way that you can use.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular that make him more upset.
These people are damaging their image and unilaterally reporting.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to restrain the media from reporting but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies which he could use.
Pawan Bansal, who is surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, put the opposition in one place by saying that he has not looked at a woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised where the woman’s talk finally came from in the middle.
Perhaps Bansals gesture was towards the domestic relations of a big BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter on the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to lodge a complaint against him by implicating a woman during the last parliamentary elections, which did not materialise.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said he has been questioned by the CBI in connection with the railway bribery case.
If they were made witnesses in the case, would it be made only after thorough investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam he was talking about, he had written a letter to only one person in need.
If their sins are forgiven, they will receive eternal life.
He said though the corporation did not have a constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development works are concerned, a list of 15 years development works will be given to the opposition.
The way Chandigarh is being developed or is going to be developed, these people cannot even think there.
The two exchanged greetings at the Cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for his retaliatory attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan camp.
He also said about his speech that he has no other feelings in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be addressed.
The Chief Minister also had the same feeling on his face that he took Singh's speech in a positive manner.
Singh had urged the chief minister to honour the workers at the Chintan camp and protect them from the alleged harassment of officers.
However, he had also said that he was also ready to be sacked from the cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a possibility of fresh consideration in the matter of the placement of workers in government posts.
JD(U) state president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the party would soon announce the names of its workers in the 20-point committee.
They also indicated that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will himself inspect the list from his own level.
They will also check whether the opinion of the MLAs and MPs has been taken in the making of the list.
If necessary, the list will be extensively redesigned to accommodate old and committed workers.
The MLAs and MPs have alleged that they were not consulted in making the list of nominations.
While the names of those who came much later from other parties have been included in the list, many important activists active since the days of the Samata Party have remained neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, was born on December 28, 1932, in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat.
Among the five siblings, Dhirubhai was third.
The five children of the family are Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of high school.
Dhirubhai started providing financial support to his family in his early childhood.
At this time they used to set up a Bhajii shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists visiting here.
Speaking of Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he reached the city of Aden in Yemen by a ship called Cabota.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had made all arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to Watan.
In 1955, he arrived in Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket.
This is where his professional journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name is not only known in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At that time, he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of his kingdom.
Today, like his father, the two brothers are among the world-class businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, Mukesh Ambani, Anil Ambani and wife Nita Ambani.

SRINAGAR: The security cover of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party, has been reportedly withdrawn by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security has been withdrawn for political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan, who won the 2002 elections on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was part of his cabinet when Mufti Muhammad Sayeed was chief minister.
Gulam Hasan Khan said, “I have got a security cover since 1996.
I live in a place called the "Terrorists' Citadel."
A CRPF security team was deployed at my house under the command of a sub-inspector.
I also have bodyguards with me, but on Virwar, all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security squad was going from my house, I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted, Kashmir IGP Abdul Ghani Mir refused to divulge the details of the case, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will personally examine how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been removed.
"State Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz told PTI, ""There is no such thing in my knowledge."
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and will be visiting Kashmir in the next couple of days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In contrast to Modis claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure as prime minister came at a time when no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002)
Laying the foundation stone of the 182-metre-tall 'Statue of Unity' statue of Sardar Patel at Kevadia in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Earlier, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayanti.
While DAVP records show that UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements of Sardar Patel
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in the year 2008.
He said that this was due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is much less than the amount spent every year on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of the Nehru-Gandhi family members
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When Manish Tewari was asked about the difference, he said, It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, whose opponents are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in a rally in Patna last Sunday.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has accused the BJP of trying to destabilise the state.
Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr.Georges Well is providing free healthcare in rural areas of Cameroon
Wells and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
West African countries don’t have too many physicians; there’s only one doctor for 5000 people
Give your vote here or via mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for him or someone in the other top 10 to make CNN the hero of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father go to the hospital, fainting and unconscious, who was not properly equipped to help him.
Jamel Well was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
Initially, only his hand was broken, but an infection spread to his brain, and he developed a hemorrhage, which affected the rest of his life.
“There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon,” says Georges Well.
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well took his father to a very crowded clinic and hospital and received whatever treatment he could.
"It's not easy," Well said.
You leave home at 5 a.m. with the hope that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that doesn’t happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people can get stuck in death while waiting.
The situation hasn't changed much since Well's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If compared, there is one physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon can't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the private sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of healthcare spending in the country.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Well says.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Vel resolved to resolve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He also became a physician himself, and began working as a vascular surgeon at Yonde's Center Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization Escowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped around 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie up medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they actually get the honor of heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
The free medical service in these villages is indeed a reason to celebrate, and the well - with its big smile and endless energy - includes happiness.
The next morning, his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people on each trip," Well said.
They come from a distance of about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All of these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates—this document is required in school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, town hall, or at home; after the procedure, the patient moves to the recovery area, making room for the next person.
The group's generator illuminates the operating room and the sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers wake up early on Sunday morning.
It’s waist-to-neck speed, but village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
"They play drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Well said.
On Sunday his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group - which includes Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students - has had 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said he would be able to go back to work as he received free hernia surgery.
The man said, "It will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in a hospital, Vel also works at a private medical clinic around the Yonnede at night.
He pointed out that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
“I don’t know when they sleep,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Well’s group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity they can never get in their home country.
“In surgery we’ve been able to gain experimental experience in which we help Dr. Well to catch tools or clean blood stains,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S. you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students typically spend from their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after they reach Yonde, they come and go, and pay the cost of the instructions.
"There's no doubt they're heroes," says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Well, almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them so much joy.
"I'm very happy when I'm doing this," Well says.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I’m doing.
I’m doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

You won't believe it, but it's true.

"""If you look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done,"" Modi said while addressing a rally."
“The Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media,” he said.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants a controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to have a face-to-face debate.
“I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms the government in 2014, we will present the report to the people every year,” Modi said.

Obama's health care bill has been withdrawn.
Amid a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday retracted his often repeated misleading promise that “you can continue if you like your health plan.”
With millions of people receiving cancellation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
“A lot of people who have health insurance, and that’s useful, can continue that,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Addressing what he calls a "news flash" about the repeal, Obama has favoured buying new coverage in the market from US citizens who receive these information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, as much money or even cheaper a comprehensive healthcare plan than proposed.
"You'll get a better deal," he said.
It should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population, who buy insurance with their own money, may be forced to change their plans as their coverage is not in line with the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, ""I tell these American citizens directly, 'You deserve better than this.'"
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the online market launch has been "unfortunate" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," he said.
I want to gain your trust again.
Sebelius, who sat behind him at a House hearing yesterday after a sharp nod to the Republican, said the sentence in anger, which was caught by a mic. Billy Long, R-Mo, about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In a hearing that lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.

A proposal in this regard has been sent to the government by the ADA.
In this historic city surrounded by the Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, there is no longer a plot on which the ADA could make a big residential plan.
In such a situation, he has now made a plan to plan a residential plan from the east ahead, from Phaphamau in the north and Naini in the south.

In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said the U.S. spying has "inappropriately gone too far"
John Kerry has signaled the U.S.'s protective attitude to his surveillance program by accepting unintended forms that sometimes its spying "inappropriately goes too far."
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty of being on a "automatic pilot" in the form of a rebuttal disclosure to informant Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities.
This secrecy has brought the U.S. government to a diplomatic crossroads in relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, me, and others in the government were really aware of some of the things that happened to the automatic pilot, because looking back, World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11 had its potential.
He has become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying has exceeded its limits, but insists that no one’s rights have been abused.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone far beyond improperly.”
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is currently conducting an in-depth review so that there is no sense of abuse in anyone.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that the NSA, however, was striving for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He further explained: “We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We have saved the plane from actually falling, destroying buildings, and killing people because we have been able to learn about the plans of others in advance.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said U.S. lawmakers would go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and try to convince European countries about the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threat of their participation in counter-terrorism organisations being blocked by the National Security Agency because of their frustration over surveillance.
Murphy, who was first elected to the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington: “It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that European countries stand with us in the context of our counterterrorism efforts.”
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have brought bitterness to relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said the reports were not entirely accurate, and reflect a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has monitored the cellphones of 34 other world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of spying on allies as necessary and said it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the ruckus, Murphy said his office was making arrangements for a Congress visit that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include both parties and members of both chambers.
The names of other participating law makers will be released in the coming days.
He said that work on the yatra programme is still going on.
While Murphy said the trip was intended to improve relations, he said some "impractical relationships" would also have to be abandoned.
European leaders will also have to be honest with their people, with their spying programs that have been used for years, he said.
“While we can revise our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones doing the spying,” Murphy said.
During this time, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend, where he will address the animosity about U.S. surveillance activities from U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy of making board changes in municipalities has started.
Recently, Trinamool was converted into a board due to a change in the party's board of councillors led by the Congress in Saithia municipality of Virbhum district.
The change came as most of the Congress councillors, including the chairman of the municipality, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but a few councillors of the CPI(M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also seized control of the TMC here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy termed it as a good sign for the party.
They said 10 Congress corporators, including Saithia municipality chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some left-wing councillors, including the CPI(M), have also held the Trinamool flag.
All of them have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the number force, the Saithia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Mr Rai also claims that all agree with the roadmap laid out for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, CPI, CPI, and Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome in Trinamool.
The TMC's takeover of the municipal board is being seen as a major political issue in the wake of a change in the party of Congress corporators in the municipality ahead of the November 22 municipal elections.
Earlier, the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Rivera were also examples of the Trinamool taking over the Congress-ruled municipal board.
Those joining the party are accorded a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata when the party takes over the municipal board in the districts due to change of party.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break away from other parties and join the Trinamool.
He says those who break away from any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
He claimed that people's faith is growing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, which has resulted in people wanting to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the CPI(M), says lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated and threatened.
People are scared to join the Trinamool Congress.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen by the CPI(M) as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is inevitable to question the justification for changing the vote in favour of power.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Thai Imprisonment Period
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely accusing the taxi driver of assaulting her, she has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Phuket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false allegations against Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver, along with two other men, attempted to stop him on Sunday morning.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned safely to the hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
When the Phuket police interrogated Bamfort for two days, he admitted to making up the story.
He was kept in a local police cell before being produced before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is "extremely concerned" about their daughter's care and that they want her back in Australia.
"It's certainly been a worrying time for us, but we hope she'll be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamfod has appealed against the sentencing order, and has secured bail on 50,000 Baht.
Meanwhile in Australia, the report said that she was vacationing at a place in southern Thailand where Crabby is vacationing.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being contested by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in the court extending his sentence to two years and force him to live in an adult prison.
However, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also offer an amnesty in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
