Rapid increase in cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The surge in cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend between the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom that ensures that even though the country is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in all countries.
Based on available knowledge from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to ramp up preparedness for the rapid growth of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia related to unknown pathology was reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus as an effective ingredient is now being referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the illness as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, there is evidence that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
Of the 14% cases, COVID-19 becomes a more serious disease that creates a need for hospitalisation, while 6% of the cases experience a serious illness that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we are reviewing the trend of the cumulative cases of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and comparing them to the Hubei province of China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK to the number of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
China's backward COVID-19 spread more geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently followed by this country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the number of Eurosurveillance 2020 on March 5, Spiteri and her colleagues reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan in China's Hubei province were reported by France on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of 31 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.
The number of COVID-19 cases and the number of confirmed cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is only informed of the number of COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, derived from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO, which is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess trends in the EU/EEA and the UK for COVID-19 and to compare what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated a short 14-day increase in COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each country in the EU/EEA and the UK for the period of 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We have also presented the cumulative numbers of documented cases in each country as of 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. and are compared with Italy's cases for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the 14-day short-period increase in COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK followed the trend in Hubei Province (China) in general (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative cases of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then sharply increased around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary Material).
This was mainly driven by the rapid increase in Italy's reported case numbers, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 increases (complementary materials).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of Italy's numbers with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported a comparable total of cases in Italy in just 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend noted in the increasing cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is moving at a relatively fast pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, despite the variations in national public health responses, and possibly in countries with different definitions of cases and different protocols for the selection of patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in Italy's infected areas described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources said hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
The data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or an intensive care unit is currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (the data is not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to supplement current surveillance data, which focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 in Germany in a 4.2-bed format per 100,000 population of Portugal showed a large gap between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (in 2010–11, 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people).
With the prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK, the modelling circumstances relating to healthcare affordability have shown that there is a <0x3E>90% risk of overburdening the capacity of intensive care beds and are provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 by the ECDC.
Since the cases are up to date in some EU/EEA countries and in some areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically provide a specific regional service to the user population, information on affected and intensive care beds is recommended to be available in the method of naming regional units for the Level 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is making rapid progress in the EU/EEA and the UK.
So the ongoing community of SARS-CoV-2 in the country, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the situation of infection and the need for health care and in particular the need for intensive care, as happened in the affected areas of Italy.
A quick, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, is essential, with changes in the mitigation approach from suppression, since the expected rapid increase in the number of cases, if not implemented ahead of time, may not give the decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and respond accordingly.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity that countries have the potential to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and further increase their control efforts to reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, there is a possibility that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
More than 3,000 people have died and more than 80,000 people have been infected in China and the rest of the world due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Actuated Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, a catastrophe on mankind.
SARS-CoV is similar to the compound virus that caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be infected with bats and cause the same symptoms through the same procedure.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are lower than that of SARS but are much more contagious and more prevalent in older people and men than in young people.
In response to many of the fast-growing publications about emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the subject of rapidly developing research.
We will include the epidemiology of the disease, epidemiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, motion indicators of the disease, and primary factors about prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate the dreaded disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were told to stay indoors for the whole of the holiday and even for many weeks, due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its corresponding disease was named COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to more than 50 countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 caused by the virus, of which more than 40,000 patients have been released and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"The WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""the number one enemy of the people"" and possibly more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 articles on COVID-19, including viruses, epidemiology, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published in less than two months since the first reported on January 7, 2020, which has set the sequence of viruses isolated from multiple patients.
The review seeks to summarize the progress of research in new and rapidly developing areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 epidemic).
We also discussed what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis and some of the remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non- lethal pathogens in humans that cause about 15% of the 4 common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered high pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which respectively began an epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and which soon spread to many other countries with appalling symptoms and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, the sources of clusters of pneumonia that were unknown were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal case in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, health care providers were notified of infections, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down and all its public transport was closed.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 stated that only 21 of the 41 confirmed patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered to be the starting point of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to about 50 other countries in China and around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation rapidly escalates, the final magnitude and intensity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centred survey on 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has mainly been found in the 30-65 age group.
About half of the infected people (47.7%) were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 of those infected were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 days (2-9) from onset to diagnosis.
The incubation period for the average pathogen was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had risen sharply before January 23, 2020, in line with the period of mass transportation ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the cumulative mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subset of large and enveloped viruses containing a single source of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four categories or genera, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect people.
Glycoprotein (S) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binds to its cellular customer angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptideyl peptidease 4 (DPP4), respectively, and then membrane addition occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replicating the viral genome, Envelop forms the genomic RNA virion-containing vesicle or spleen with glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins, which then merges with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity among the 10 successive samples collected from the Wuhan marine food market in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is much more similar to SARS-CoV than MES-CoV.
Through a compression electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the superficial part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 disproportionately weaker than SARS-CoV, which is in fact equivalent to causing less severe infection in SARS-CoV-2 patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms a novel tiny protein encoded by orf3b and can also produce proteins encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the ability to cause viral diseases and inhibit the release of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional areas or strains.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 at a 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in mixed components, including amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the open and closed-adapted mixed material was combined as a dimmer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixed material could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and transmission of CoVs.
For the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing.
Original and intermediate costumes
It has been reported that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and have spread to humans through civet cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus was 96% similar to the two SARS-CoVs derived from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVX21.
However, the extent to which an intermediate host virus helped to overcome the barrier of the species to infect humans is still unknown and the transmission path is yet to be explained in detail.
Ji and others who presented the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that is involved in the homologous recombination of S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that often used in traditional Chinese medicine, the longitudinal pangolin, anthocyanins found in mammals - SARS-CoV-2 and CoVs - 99% of which are likely intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology.
However, the 1% difference in the spread of the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the conclusions are still awaited for very strong evidence (Fig. 33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 5 days in a dry environment outside the body for 48 hours and at temperatures below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents can effectively neutralize the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks the immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore they are at risk of contracting the novel virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).
Usually, after a virus has entered the host, it is first identified by the host's innate immune system through receptors of the pattern (pattern) marking. These receptors include receptors such as C-type lecithin, toll-like receptors (TLRs), and NOG-RIs.
Through various pathways, the virus provokes the manifestation of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the transmission of the virus and accelerate the macrophage fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from the immune system's response.
Soon, the useful immune response also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in the prevention of T lymphocytes.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T-helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokine to help the immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the action of T cells by inducing the death of T cells.
The body's immune system, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infections.
For example, separate antibodies from recovered patients prevent MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive sensitivity to the immune system locally produces a large number of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ abnormalities can even lead to death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by early onset of glaucoma, is more likely to cause harm to the elderly and pregnant women with pre-existing diseases.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immunity is weak are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the research of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, studies on 1,099 patients showed that the incubation period for the disease was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
According to the above description, a recent study showed that the incubation period of the pathogen based on the population of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting the effective quarantine time based on the incubation period of the most accurate pathogen is very important for health authorities, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected but asymptomatic people to others.
As a general practice, people infected or exposed to the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period up to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients felt dyspnea (breathing) and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and quantopathy.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of shortness of breath and even pulmonary imaging abnormalities need to be tested for the virus in case of early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that 98% of the percentage of symptoms were fever, 76% had dry cough, 55% had dyspnea, and 3% had diarrhea; 8% needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies have reported similar findings in a class of glaucoma (family cluster) and a glaucoma (cluster) caused by infection from a person with no symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, they needed ventilation support of 80%, which is much higher than COVID-19 patients and is consistent with a higher mortality rate for MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients were also found to have diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
In SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and about 14-20% of patients required ventilation support.
As of February 14, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2% while confirmed cases reached 66,576.
In comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate, with 8,096 confirmed cases accounting for 10% of the total cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
A previous study reported that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than R0 6.47 with Confidence Interval (CI) at 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only from 2 to 4.
In terms of symptoms, mortality and R0, a comparison of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 is presented in Table 1.1.
The numbers above indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
The onset of the disease is often in the same family or from vehicles such as ships in the same collection or sea.
Patients often have a history of contact with infected people or patients who have traveled or lived in Wuhan or other infected places or have symptoms in the past two weeks.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have recovered from the hospital can carry the virus again, sending a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the patients is normal or low.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1 <0xC3><0x97> 109 / L was found in lymphocyte count <0x3C> 4 <0xC3><0x97> 109 / L including lymphoprene and 10 <0xC3><0x97> L with elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia <0x3C> 1,099 <0xC3><0x97> 1 in COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscular arousal and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients had increased droplets of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes in the blood.
In patients with severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a fibrin-corrosive product present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
Abnormalities of chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral uneven shade or opacity of glass in the lungs.
Patients are often diagnosed with asymptomatic pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid secretion, and progressive fibrosis seriously threaten the gas exchange.
Unusual action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface-tension, thus reducing the ability to expand the lungs and increasing the risk of weakening the lungs.
Therefore, the worst types of test radiographic findings are often seen in the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, pathological analysis of COVID-19 has shown the dissociation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated synsital cells in the lungs of the deceased person with the disease, which is consistent with viral infection and the pathology of ARDS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to extremely high mis-negative rates, which can accelerate the pandemic, in China, clinical or clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which are no longer dependent on RT-PCR alone).
A similar situation has arisen in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the connection between the history of the disease, diagnostic displays, laboratory tests, and radiological investigations is essential and necessary to determine the effective disease.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of a CRISPR-based Sherlock (Sherlock) technique to determine SARS-CoV-2, which uses dipsticks in less than an hour without the need for extended materials, ranging from 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L-A (micropots per input).
It is hoped that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and usefulness when diagnostic samples are verified.
With other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases due to lack of experience with Novel CoV (Table 2), doctors can provide primarily supportive sleep to COVID-19 patients as they have been previously used for treatment or have tried various suggested therapies.
This therapy includes antiviral drugs, immune response suppression, steroids, recovered patients' plasma, Chinese medicine and psychiatric support current and potential treatments.
It was also suggested to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and also possibly attacks other organs at lower doses that exhibit ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Still, respiratory dysfunction and disability are the leading threats and causes of death in patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and saves lives, and this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, ventilation that does not have to be cut, and mechanical ventilation that has to be cut depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory disorders.
It is also essential to maintain electrolyte balance in SARS-CoV-2 patients, prevent and treat indirect infections and septic shocks, and protect the functioning of vital organs.
It has been reported that excessive response to the immune system in SARS and MERS patients results in a cytokine disaster.
The cytokine catastrophe is a form of inflammatory response of the system that appears through the release of cytokine classes, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines release a large number of free radicals through immune cells, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ disorders.
Repression of the immune response is essential in the treatment of cytokine disasters, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine disasters.
Other immune response suppressive treatments for cytokine disasters include correction of T cell-directed immune response; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF inhibition; JAK mitigation; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
Although high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteoarthritis, dramatically affecting the likelihood of recovery.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids from low to medium doses have been advised to be used judiciously for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
No effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed at the time of writing.
However, intravenous application, including remdesivir, nucleotide analogues, have proven to be effective for a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, I also showed remdesivir, a possible prevention of other single-source RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided this compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
Baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Therapy combined with lopinavir/ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
There is a long history of blood collection from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in terms of pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other external objects, and they detect individual molecules of pathogens and directly mitigate them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it, inflammation and viral load were reduced, and the involvement of oxygen in the blood was improved.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed and prior verification and clarification are necessary to propose methods for mass use.
Also, in terms of medical effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to quickly develop and manufacture antibodies at a certain stage in the fight against the global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and fruitful to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes to monitor effective antibodies against the virus's essential proteins or to encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple elements in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most of the effective ingredients are unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify the optimal combination of such ingredients.
Currently, in the absence of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients returning from severe stages.
For example, it was known that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In many Chinese states, where TCM was used for treatment of COVID-19 patients, 87% had the highest recovery rate, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where TCM was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the recovery rate was 13%.
However, this is quite a gross comparison because many other influencing factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing WM and TCM combined treatments to Western medicine (WM).
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, symptoms to go away, and hospital admission was significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most interestingly, the marginal decline rate (light to severe) was significantly lower than that of the WM<0x2B>TCM team only (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower than that of the WM<0x2B>TCM team only (8.8% vs. 39%).
Despite this, the effectiveness and security of TCM is waiting for more and more controlled testing at greater levels and more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the working process and, if possible, clarify the effective ingredients or combinations of TCM treatments.
The majority of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are highly contagious and even have a fear of life-threatening illness, and people in quarantine also experience anxiety, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to further anxiety and stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychotic symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor seizures, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and individuals who have come into contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of a mental health team from multiple branches of medicine, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak and medical planning of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the chain of infection from animal reservoirs and sensitive hosts from infected people and are often supplemented with antiviral treatments to control the epidemic caused by the exposed virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-term and strong immune antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested on animal models of SARS.
However, before starting a clinical study, the efficacy of these vaccines in the elderly and in the life-threatening-challenge model and their protection against virus transmission from animal sources to humans has not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, outbreaks and swarms of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the existence of zoonotic sources in the diseased region.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Preparing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-infectious people is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the need for a long time (average 18 months) for vaccine development and the dynamic change in CoV-types.
As a novel disease, the complete diagnostic course of COVID-19 has just begun to be fully developed for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly except for a pre-existing disease.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with much higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is essential for health-care agencies to create a predictive model of the disease to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the speed indicator of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the outcome of SARS disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 patients described above, COVID-19 mainly occurred in 30-65 years of age, including 47.7% of patients who were over 50.
Patients who needed intensive care were at the same time more likely to have other conditions and complications, and were significantly older than others (66 years of age versus 51 years of age), indicating age as the disease's speed indicator for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: Men have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 more than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
The existence and complications of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer severe heart attacks and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to the ACE2-positive colongiosite, which may result in faulty liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying diseases are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Unusual information found in the laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to the tissue and have been proposed as a potential disease speed indicator for disease, therapy response and final recovery.
The correlation between the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 with the CRP level was also suggested.
In addition, raised lactate can also help predict the consequences of dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK).
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are excreted during cell damage.
Thus, these are traditional markers for the dysfunction of the heart or liver.
Major symptomatic symptoms: Periodic progress of chest radiography and symptomatic symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the complexity and consequences of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an accessory treatment for infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteochondrosis with long-term disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic often suffered from prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and were under unusual psychological stress when they saw patients falling in the face of death, including family members and patients.
It is essential to give psychological advice and provide long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seem to be different from that of SARS.
In addition to replicating the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate on the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs responsible for common colds.
Thus, patients suffering from early stage or disease outbreaks, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic, can produce a large amount of virus during daily work.
However, SARS-CoV infection was considered to occur when patients became seriously ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more acute and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities in the hope of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and continuous quarantines of almost the entire population.
While these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowness of the pandemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the downward phase of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others had speculated that COVID-19, which is proving to be more infectious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital 2 weeks ago were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in both the mid-turbine and throat-derived salivary, indicating that the newly identified virus would become a similar cyclical phase as influenza.
However, there are optimistic signs in China based on the falling number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may continue to work.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been kept under control until the end.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become vulnerable to infection and eventually be destroyed or become a relatively less contagious virus in living with humans.
Below is a comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and also through direct contact with potentially contaminated material by the virus.
The virus was also found in the mole, which highlighted the new possibility of an infection from the mal-to-faecal.
A recent study on 138 cases said that 41% of the cases were likely caused by nosocomial (hospital origin) infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, adequate precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even those close to patients or infected people.
Masks may be used as the first stage of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (Series <0x23> 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of liquid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or sticking to the surface of the object, from which they could spread to others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23> 1860s) masks can protect against breathing smaller virions such as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virions are able to fully penetrate; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is the same as that of SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can even enter through five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series <0x23> 1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks worn by health care providers to further reduce contact with the virus, people should also wear appropriate isolation gowns.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face coverings or goggles while working with patients.
In public areas affected or potentially affected, everyone is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, to try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet between people is considered appropriate for a patient to stay away from.
These measures adopted are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus in the human world, China's high alert should have been taken based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high resemblance to SARS-CoV, according to a January 7, 2020 report.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control had reassured citizens that the novel virus was less contagious and limited in human-to-human reproduction and that there was no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
This message significantly relaxed public outcry, especially when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival and a significant amount of time was wasted to suppress the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can take this strict learning and make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations need to be more careful when making public declarations (1) because each word will be considered by citizens and it can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to practices that are unwanted from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more responsive to practices that are not effective; (3) be more proactive at the initial stage to try to suppress potential epidemics and (4) to increase public awareness of epidemic disease.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and has spread to more than 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this report.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and is also similar to the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of the return of SARS.
However, there are some noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary to suppress the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than young people, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients also transmit the virus in asymptomatic conditions, while SARS patients typically do so in severe illness, making it much more difficult to suppress COVID-19 infection than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more quickly and more massively than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluations for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can again be positive in the case of the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Considering the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be resolved as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS- righteous CoVs has been found, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, such as bats to humans?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the spread of the infection and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cell and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also block the ACE2-speaking cells of other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus spread in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will there be a death like SARS, or will there be a re-emergence like flu at some point in time?
This is important, but it takes some time to find answers to the above and many more questions.
But no matter what the price it demands, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and take our lives back to normal.
The Origins of the Human Coronavirus
Transformations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including mankind, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as common colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown the coin upside down to reveal how devastating and life-threatening the HCoV infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back to the top of the discussion, and it has surprised us by showing us high transmission and low pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-borne disease and understanding of the zoonotic source of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs have emerged from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Some HCoV-mediated aadhaar shelters have also been reported.
Animal nutrition has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating the interaction of CoVs in animals can also provide important insights into the CoV pathology in humans.
In this review, we are giving an overview of existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, their history of discovery, as well as their animal sources and interrelated infections.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the point of view of virus evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was discussed.
In addition, the need for a successful host change and the effects of the virus' evolution in the severity of the disease is also noted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the coronavirus family, which consists of a group of wrapped, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses harboring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases of RNA viruses were called ""CoVs"" because of the crown-national organelles beneath the electron microscope."
Structurally, CoVs have integral genomes that belong to the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1b replication polyprotein (translation).
Polyproteins are processed to produce 16 more non-structural proteins, which have been named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins that include the worm (S), the wrapper (E), the membrane (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which beta-CoVs contain mostly HCoVs and are divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Ethnic evidence has shown that bats and rats serve as gene sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the mainstays of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually overcome interspecies barriers and emerged as some of the major human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severate Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly detected SARS-CoV-2 caused acute respiratory infection symptoms (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS) and a higher likelihood of exposure outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from nasal discharge in patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the idea was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak that the transmission of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and had a crude mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused epidemics to continue on the Arabian Peninsula and spread dismally throughout the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the effective agent of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people as of March 3, 2020, and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal origin from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary source of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses show well-adapted and non-communicable but great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
HCoVs provide a framework for exploring animal sources to understand the causes of natural history, driving force, and species-to-species (spicy jumping) limitations.
It can guide or guide the search for the base, intermediate and amplifying animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important factors involved in preventing future spillovers.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal sources, interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we would like to take this general context into account and discuss that the parental viruses of HCoV-types are usually unhealthy in their natural base hosts, but become pathogenic after entering the body of the new host.
We also review the trend of the evolution of HCoVs where morbidity is often reduced with the increase in transmissibility.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoVs were collected in various infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, before the first collection of HCoV-229E strain from the nasal discharge in patients with common cold.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Series 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract in patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in the line of WI-38 lung cells.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, common cold symptoms including headaches, sneezing, feeling unwell and sore throats were observed, and fever and cough were seen in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from the recurrent growth of the virus in the organ culture and later in the brains of dairy rats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to the symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be sedated symptomatically from infection of other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are mainly infected in winter climates during the temperate season.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A study by human volunteers found that healthy people with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Severe lower respiratory tract infections were seen in only patients with certain immunity impairments.
"SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first recorded HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the causal representative of SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV."
The first case of SARS was found in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has reported 8,096 cases across many countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and appearing on the 10th day of illness could increase the final symptoms of viral load as well as nearly two ancillary cases.
In patients with SARS-CoV, it is primarily seen as a delayed symptom of muscle soreness, headache, fever, turbulence and shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath after a cold.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests, and enlarged creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Damage to the diffuse alveolar, the expansion of the epithelial cell and the increase of macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later time.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can be infected with these serious events, usually accompanied by cytokine disasters that can be particularly deadly in patients with immune system disorders.
The virus was first collected from open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially prevalent in younger children, the elderly and patients with respiratory illness who had low immunity.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in cholera, eye, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and most of these occur in the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crope.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, which causes mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four group-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to be mutated to cause high pathogenic diseases, although accidents due to unknown causes have been rare, such as the highly harmful subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs have the ability to infect effectively and sustain themselves continuously in humans, they are also less harmful or contagious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who contracted acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases have emerged from the Middle East, cases from outside have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia, including a second-stage spread in sometimes close contacts.
In 2015, another second-stage outbreak occurred in South Korea, where 186 confirmed cases were found.
Marked by progressive acute pneumonia, the clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also had acute renal impairment, which is unique to MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach disease such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories have confirmed that more than 34.4% of deaths have been reported, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses for the human body.
From mid-December 2019 to the end of 2019, classes of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan city of Hubei province, China, as the cases are traditionally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, with a total mortality rate of 3.4%, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
Notably, the death rate for Hubei in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and acute respiratory distress syndrome can progress rapidly.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequencing homology, they cluster in different branches of the ethnic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is seemingly less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as a symptomless case and could play a role in its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs shows a lot of similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period of the pathogen and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 followed by SARS-CoV and public transmission of four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are typically seen with non-specific, mild, or even symptomless presentations during community-acquired HCoV-like infections.
On the other hand, a small portion of severe cases of COVID-19 also show symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection group shows interesting characteristic traits of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of group-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, transmissibility declines after passage between humans, it is yet to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 is the same.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the sample of moles.
At least in some circumstances, it remains to be clarified by future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 infection plays an important role in cases such as SARS-CoV.
It is particularly important to see if SARS-CoV-2, like community-acquired HCoVs, shows the same seasonality.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread after passage in humans, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four groups of mild symptoms-acquired HCoVs have all been well-matched with humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be the successor to the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and people who develop severe HCoVs have been eradicated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to mobilize adaptive mutations that fight the causes of host constraints.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and the more people infected with it, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop the infection in the human body by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four group-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, and causing common colds in patients with general immunity.
These viruses do not require any animal support.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and cannot be transmitted in humans.
These need to be maintained and expanded on zoonotic bases, and perhaps seek opportunities to spread to viable human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least until now, it is highly transmissible, just like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than group-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It has to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and continues to spread among humans without any adhar or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal sources of HCoVs, we will benefit from discussing the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, base, intermediate, and amplification hosts of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoVs if it harbours closely related precursors by sharing higher homology at the level of nucleotide sequences.
The virus is usually well adapted to the body of this host and is non-infected.
Similarly, an Aadhaar shelter provides shelter to HCoVs continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the hosts are infected naturally and they are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly identified with an intermediate host before or just around the human being, it does not fit well with the new host and is often pathological.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host to temporarily replicate the virus, and then it can play a role in amplifying the level of human infection through infection in the human body.
If HCoVs can't keep up with the infection in the intermediate host, there may be a movement of infection.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and start a long-term outbreak.
In this case, the middle dress becomes the dress of the natural base.
Epidemiological data had traditionally revealed that the SARS indicator had a history of animal contact with prey.
Further seroprevalence studies have indicated that there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG in animal traders than in the general population.
A raccoon dog was first identified to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that was almost identical to the SARS-CoV in the savanna (Paguma larvata) and live animal markets.
This was indirectly supported by the information that no further cases of SARS have been reported in the markets after killing all the gourds.
However, it was found that the wild or farm masked palm civets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, indicating that masked palm spores would act as only intermediate amplifying host but not as a natural basis for SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the Guangzhou market has anti-SARS-CoV antibodies of different types of animals, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these are considered to be one-way hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV has revealed a closely related bat CoV, SARS-related rhinolophos bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), named after the Chinese variant of SARS-CoV-HKU3, which exists in the Chinese horse-batshoe bat, the next search has revealed a closely related bat CoV, SARS-CoV.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for new ideas that bats provide shelter to emerging human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like CoVs have been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be collected as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a customer of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from samples of bat moles was demonstrated to use bats, civets and human ACE2 as receptors for entry into cells.
Interestingly, the serums of SARS-infected patients who were recovering were able to deactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although these two viruses have a high level of homology, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not an immediate parental virus and bats are not an immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analyses categorize MERS-CoV in the same category as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat uses the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4), to enter the CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses.
RNA polymerase sequences of RNA-dependent MERS-CoV are phylogenetically close to replicas of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-knife camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV specific sedative antibodies, just like camels from the Middle East source in multiple African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was collected from the swabs of the nose of a hump camel, which further indicates that the camel serves as the actual base sponsor of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels that have been experimentally infected by MERS-CoV usually have mild symptoms, but a lot of virus shedding has been observed.
Notably, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory system, but also through the anus-oral route, which is also the main way to spread the virus from bats.
However, questions still remain because many confirmed cases of MERS before the onset of symptoms have no history of contact with the camel, possibly from human to human transmission or from an unknown animal species that harbours MERS-CoV.
The bat CoV RaTG13 collected from Rhinolophas afinis bat has a 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also very much in favor of determining the parental relationship.
This means that, if almost identical bat CoVs are not found in the future, bats may not be the direct reservoir(s) of SARS-CoV-2.
Perhaps, the animal shelter between SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the early cases of COVID-19 were related, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission.
A number of recent studies based on methanogenic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as Banerui (Manis Javanica) may also carry SARS-CoV-2-related pituitary beta-CoVs.
85-92% of these novel bonsai CoV genomes are replicas of nucleotide sequence homology SARS-CoV-2.
However, with almost 90% uniformity in the level of nucleotide sequencing, they are equally involved with RaTG13.
They bind to two sub-genres of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the ethnic tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 by identifying 97.4% amino acid sequences.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are further deviated, although the sequence homology genome-wide higher degrees.
A previous study on the diseased bonsai also reported the detection of a continuous sequence of viruses from lung samples, which has been shown to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to create partial genome sequences with approximately 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct forestry source of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence isolation between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much lower than that of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 and Banarayi SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While most of the sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and Banarui's RBD has been found, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-syndromes, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the most genome-wise sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high similarity between beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 associated with the RBD of the Banarui SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective-mediated mutations.
A counter proposal is in favor of recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13, one of the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination between beta-CoVs is widespread.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were derived from bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It is reported that a bat CoV, known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), detected in North American triplets with HCoV-NL63, has demonstrated a close relationship.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat called Hipposideros/Ghanacom/19/2008, although comedians have also been suspected of being the intermediate host.
For clarity, the animal sources of known HCoVs are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission of CoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected people from domesticated animals, a respiratory epidemic was observed.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is an alpha CoV.
A number of evidence supports the transmission of the virus to the human body from bats.
First, the shared ecological environment may be from bat contact with humans but not with alpacas.
People are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoV-associated bats are diverse and non-infected in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoVs cause the outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Alpaca alpha-CoVs are not found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas receive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it's not too surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
The bat, on the other hand, acts as a gene pool of alpha-CoV-like HCoV-229E, but the alpaca and one-knife camels can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of the spread of interspecies transmission from bats to humans from one helical camel and one helical camel to another.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV from bats is known in early detection and is reinforced by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, logistically full colonies, close social exchanges and strong flying skills are the favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal 'virus spreaders'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has come into contact with a humming camel decades ago.
It fits well with these camels that have evolved from an intermediate shelter to a stable and natural base shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low prevalence rate in these animals.
Its spread among humans is an accident and people remain the latest host of MERS-CoV as its infection cannot be prevented.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 infection is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the latest host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs similar to sardines in the case of SARS-CoV.
The various possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans may have to be included in or canceled in future studies.
First, bats can be the backbone host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus similar to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share environmental niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, forestry may be one of the intermediate amplifying shelters where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus was newly introduced.
Humans are infected with the virus by cutting and eating the meat of the victim.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domesticated and wild animals has been confirmed for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
Animal sources of SARS-CoV-2 are still being investigated.
In addition to the different types of animal shelters, the three main factors on the viral side are also important in helping CoVs to overcome interspecies barriers.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered ""high"" to ""medium"" depending on the stage of adaptation of the novel host CoV, and the average replacement rate <0x7E>10-4 replacements per site per year will be 2."
CoV-types have a proof-reading exocytosis, the result of which is very high variability and weakness or even survival disability.
Interestingly, the CoV is known to form a receptor by reducing the exocytogenic and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the nucleotide analog remdesivir.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 ingredients tested in clinical trials.
Yet, CoV-type mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their host.
In addition, the conversion rate is often higher when the CoV-like host is not well-adapted.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher transmissibility rate, the transmissibility rate of SARS-CoV-2 is seemingly low, which is an indication that humans are more easily adaptable.
It is likely that it has already adapted to another host near people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to one humming camel.
Theoretically, it is highly unlikely that the genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 will make vaccines and antivirals quickly ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoVs uses extra flexibility in genomes for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of evolution, including interrelated ones, which, when the situation becomes convenient, facilitates the emergence of CoVs.
It is supported by a lot of uniquely encoded open reading frames and protein functions at the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> edge of the genome.
"Third, CoV-types randomly and often change templates when replicating RNA through a unique ""copy-select"" process."
In a host that acts as a mixing vessel, strand switching often occurs during CoV RNA replication.
Higher homogeneous full-length and subgenomic RNAs can reconnect to create new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat-CoV-HKU9.
Infection-related viral interactions
In addition to the three viral ingredients described above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
In this, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as an ideal example, which also showed evidence of positive selection when interspecies transmission occurred.
Based on comparative analysis between the collection of human and aromatic SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to adapt quickly to the RBD spectrum of different hosts, especially the S protein.
The RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is sharply selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the S1 fragment from 318th to 510th amino acids that bind to human ACE2 as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptors from various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to be different from those found in human and rbd, and 4 of them are located in the customer-binding design to interact with the ACE2 customer.
The Civet SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T mutations, which can increase the affinity of the spike protein exchange with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be serious for virus-related adaptations in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar to cellular subscribers.
The 30% difference between the S1 unit of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates that the tendency of the human ACE2 to bind to its S protein may vary.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a tendency to bond 10 to 20 times higher than what is found in human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine if another co-recipient may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Worryingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV customers, such as Aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyllated salicylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be regarded as the reason for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after they have been infected from their animal host to the interspecies.
In addition to cellular receptors, the results of interspecies transmission of HCoVs are also guided by factors of dependence and limitation on other hosts.
The division of these host proteins between human and natural base hosts of HCoVs such as bats, a humming camel, and rats can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to capture the host dependency factors for a successful interspecies transmission and destroy the host constraints factors.
In this case, the molecular determinants and character descriptions are yet to be identified in this important case of virus-causing interactions.
A neutral genome-wide screening of the host dependency and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR can be fruitful.
The Rise of Novel HCoVs: Back to Where It Started
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as gene pools for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid transmissibility and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the ability to drastically modify the acquisition or lost viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in adapting to humans because SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but have been found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion feature of SARS-CoV has been found in strains collected at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it seems to be an adapted mutation that stimulates shelter reversal.
In addition, there is a potential recombination history of SARS-CoV with clusters of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recursive positions were also identified in parts of nsp9, most of nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different tribes, which occurred in the case of a humongous camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to undesirable changes in the viral genome, possibly as a result of the release of viruses from election pressures such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to the removal of bi-nucleotide.
Although intact ORF4 can be seen in HCoV-229E-related bats and camel viruses, the alpaca alpha-CoV appears to be placed inside a single nucleotide, resulting in the frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the election pressure.
When bats were infected by CoV, they were either symptomless or they were detected only with mild symptoms, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoV-like and bats.
It has been found that bats adapt well to CoVs both in terms of origin and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology driven by CoVs.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity of bats has been suppressed due to the low exposure levels of reactive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the main histoplasmicity complex I class molecules.
Moreover, both suppressing the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) CoVs produced from the high metabolic activity of bats and affecting the proofing by exoribobneuclides can, thus, provide the selection pressure needed to produce the strains of the virus when coming into contact with a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also develop through recombination that leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein character for host adaptation.
So, the possibility of the emergence of three new HCoVs over the last two decades is unlikely.
CoVs cause mild symptoms in non-communicable or their base hosts, such as bats and camels.
They grew stronger without the strong resistance of the host.
There is a secret about why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by excessive activation of the immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is distinguished from the CoV counterpart.
The same technique of disconnecting the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reactions are particularly strong.
Therefore, the application of type I interferon should be beneficial in at least the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in bats is flawed.
With this reasoning, the prevention of NLRP3 influenza, including MCC950, may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common factors that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV has been found that exchanges 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, while on the other hand, there is a bat-CoV that exchanges 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the smelly and other animals found on the market are reported to have harbored viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Rarely homologous with SARS-CoV-2 have been found to be beta-CoVs, indicating that the wild boar will act as one of the intermediate hosts or that the boaroo beta-CoV-some may contribute to gene fragmentation in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentional or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have once again returned to the center of discussion.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the importance of animal sources and HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted between humans through intermediate hosts.
As the SARS-CoV infection emerged from contact between humans and spores in the market, killing spores there by shutting down the wet market could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, pangolins should be removed from the wet markets in order to prevent animal infections in the wake of the discovery of multiple tribes of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, what exactly and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between humans and other mammals remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in single-knock camels.
These camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and fur for local people in addition to important instruments of transport.
They spread across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for the control of MERS, as was done in China's wild animal market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the repeated outbreak of MERS, a holistic approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control systems.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotype outbreaks may occur.
Many animal CoVs are found in nature.
In particular, bat-CoVs with animal potential are very diverse.
These zoonotic CoVs have great potential to multiply and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China.
With the testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a plan for better preparedness and response.
Viruses have been around for a long time.
They stay on their own natural basis until they get a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are warned to stay away from them.
In order to have a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural host, it is necessary to constantly monitor mammals, which will prove effective in preventing human infection and future outbreaks from animals.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases in humans is to stay away from the environmental niche of the natural base of the animal virus.
Several pieces of animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the wild, we need to see what conditions the bat and the wild boar can share the same environmental niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or any other mammalian, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical-derived viruses will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
The ongoing investigations in this case will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the criteria for "presumed to have been infected" and "confirmed to have been infected" with COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick consultation guide for the detection and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided us with experience and made good reference for the fight against this pandemic worldwide.
However, our awareness and knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is also gradually increasing based on a new disease, ongoing research findings, and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostics and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our directives and provided the most recent COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, a completely new diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases."
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named the Sivir Actuate Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick consultation guide and it has been published in the Military Medical Research Online on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has received a great response.
Keep in mind, COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing, based on ongoing research findings and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued COVID-19-related diagnostic and medical instructions (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, a total of seven editions have been released, each of which has made significant changes to some content.
Now that Zhu and his colleagues have made a comment about our instruction, they have proposed a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and has also created valuable references to the global pandemic.
We appreciate their efforts and thank them.
However, their work will also need to be updated according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial VII Edition) and the latest research.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, one must have two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical characteristics for a detailed analysis, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three clinical symptoms must be met.
Epidemiological history: (1) residents of the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas with respiratory <0xE2><0x89><0xA5> travel history, or other communities where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of the symptoms; (2) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or cases of exposure to the virus in the last 14 days; (3) cases of infection in Wuhan city or surrounding areas.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total White Blood Cell Counts showing normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte count at the early stage of lesions.
For a confirmed case diagnosis based on a suspected case, there should be a pathogenic or serological evidence of any of the following: (1) SARS-CoV-2-positive to IgV-positive, or positive to IgV-2-positive to real-time PCR test; (2) high homogeneity or matching with known novel coronavirus in full gene sequencing of the virus; (3) serum test.
We found that, in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions, the nucleic acid determinant real-time PCR test and blood samples have been included in the trachea.
The pathological detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) versions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh version.
These changes, based on the ongoing work of the researchers, include respiratory samples with blood samples to search for a favorable nucleic acid detection kit for a quick diagnosis, which increases the availability of different samples and which helps bring certain antibody positive results to certain criteria.
Moreover, there is more evidence, which reminds us to be careful about our irregular symptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow list of Zhou and his companions should be updated, as they have classified those who do not have clinical symptoms as "low-risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in subsequent clinical practices and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come in and readers will call for their comments.
In order to diagnose "presumed to have been infected" and "confirmed cases," we recommend identifying them and following the most recent guidelines in our country.
Our team will be updated in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh daily reported five new deaths due to the highest number of COVID-19 cases.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh said that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two of the cases are aged over 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60 and one between 41-50 years of age.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at the hospital told local news agency Anadolu Agency that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Friendship Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
The closure of this public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection was recorded on March 8 between two persons who returned to Italy in Bangladesh and one of their wives.
As of 19 March, all three have recovered.
The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has exceeded one million.
Johns Hopkins University data showed that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The important event occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, in the previous 24 hours at 10 am (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were recorded, connecting at least 5,900 deaths.
According to CBS News, more than 1,000 people in the United States died of coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
Across the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin has announced that payments will continue to be made even if the Russians do not work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; 215 votes in favor, ten votes not given and one vote against were passed.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last all day; the previous curfew was only effective from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand planned to implement the curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
In Australia, shops have reduced the limit of toilet paper per transaction.
On the evening of Sunday and Saturday, Australia's store chain Wolverhampton and Coles reduced the limit of buying toilet paper per transaction in all stores at the national level to two and one package, respectively.
In addition, Aldi launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as messages on checkouts and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Consumers are reportedly stocking up on the fear of COVID-19 if people have to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths-O made a pack per order, limiting the sale of toilet paper for home delivery.
These changes follow the limitations of the four packs that Woolworths and Coles launched on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"On 8 March, Coles announced that the four-pack ban had been rolled out in several locations, but that ""in most stores everything is still sold out within an hour of delivery"", calling the demand ""unprecedented"", and in a Facebook post on Tuesday at ALDI they called it ""unprecedented""."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco stores in Canberra were also allowed for two packs last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the repeat rate of supply, Woolworths orders additional stocks, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase stockpiles, but local council restrictions made it difficult to deal with during delivery by truck.
As suppliers try to meet the demand, he expects the cost of production to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after leaving the stock earlier, some stores may not be able to handle Wednesday's special sale.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert from the University of Queensland Technology, said that stores fill their stores every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy substance that causes its collection to be very small in number and when all is sold, the huge shelves are empty and reinforces the feeling of scarcity.
"According to ABC News, ""Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if he has a lot of stuff, and things like toilet rolls and sanitizers [can be] and that they are enough, then perhaps that fear can be mitigated."""
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, said on Wednesday that their stock would run out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, i.e. those who make the sorbents that make up the Clinics toilet tissue and Solaris paper, insisted that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, some of which were due to auction purchasers getting a long weekend off on Labor Day.
In this Thursday edition of NT News, printed every Thursday in Darwin, an eight-page appendix was added to cut into pieces and used as toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on March 3 said stores were largely reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for other products is also very high, including masks, sanitizers, dry products, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, the sale of paper used for the Andres toilet at the online British supermarket Ocado every Sunday evening outside Australia is limited to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — a pandemic.
"While the term ""epidemic"" does not refer to how dangerous specific cases are but to how widespread any disease is, the World Health Organization noted the need for governments to take action:"
"""All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic."
"WHO Secretary-General Adnan Ghebreyesus has said if states can identify, ""test, treat, isolate, identify, and organise"", he said."
"""We are deeply concerned by both the alarming level of disease spread and the alarming level of severity and the alarming level of inactivity."""
"According to Dr Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is ""unprecedented""."
"In a statement published on CNN in February, he said, ""Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has continuously tracked the spread of the virus in the world."""
"Gebrassa also shares the same view, saying, ""We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."""
"He continued, ""And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."""
The new status as a global pandemic follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in January.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said about the outbreak, ""Modda, the situation is going to get worse."""
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide was at least 126,000, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been detected in 210 countries and union territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is estimated at 4%, while the worldwide range of this rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your face during coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they have been infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by restricting travel, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk controls and closing the facility.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic disruptions, cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and increased supply shortages caused by shopping for fear.
Schools and universities are no longer nationally or locally closed in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's total student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been instances of alienation and discrimination against other individuals from China, East and Southeast Asia, and others from regions where the virus cases have been found, depending on race and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, the levels of air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) reported on 31 December 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases due to unknown causes, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have an animal source.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, bushfire coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first person to show symptoms, the latter on 1 December 2019, was reported to have fallen ill; and the latter had no visible connection with the wet market cluster.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases in December 2019.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that a case detected in the source on 17 November 2019 may have been the first, which occurred in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new cases in China had so-called decreased, but the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea had increased exponentially for the first time inside China, and the number of new cases outside China.
The number of cases can be reduced, especially for people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, most of them under 19 and 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before immunity can be acquired in the working population.
According to the official protocol, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and who have tested positive.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had formal policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China had not been detected, and this undiagnosed infection was the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official count of infections.
Early estimates of the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it was likely 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not have symptoms, the death interval from the onset of symptoms is 6 to 41 days, with the most common interval being 14 days.
On April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths were said to be related to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of deaths in China have been among people over the age of 60 and 75% of them had pre-existing heart disease and diabetes. Government figures on COVID-19 usually indicate people who were infected with COVID as per traditional rules.
The number of deaths resulting from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - such as in homes, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death rate.
"A proponent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that ""we know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than the actual number of deaths"", a statement that was corroborated by reports that the U.S. had the first low-counting non-fatal death in January 2020. Such devaluations often occur in the case of a global pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu."
The first death outside mainland China was on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia was on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents of the world, except Antarctica. Several methods have been used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region, and are unaffected by demographic features such as the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time it has been cut since the initial outbreak, and the age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths and infections shows the number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the number of cases diagnosed.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide death and case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the proportion of deaths and cases dropped from 17.3% (those with symptoms between January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (those with first symptoms since February 1 of 2020). Other preventative measures include - Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths by infected individuals (the CFR), and the rate of death by infection.
These figures are not limited at any time and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculations above this range are consistent with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims that this pandemic can be controlled.
The maximum and final time frame of the project is uncertain and may vary according to location.
"McAiz Bonnie, from Penn State University, said: ""As untested, infectious diseases usually dominate, and then start to decay when the disease is no longer a host."
However, it is almost impossible to predict when this will happen.
"Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries could be brought together to follow the advice of the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the virus, ""it could end by June""."
"On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""probably will continue to spread for a year or two""."
"According to a study by Neil Ferguson-led Imperial College, ""physical distancing and other measures are required to be maintained until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or longer)""."
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's pretty unlikely that this coronavirus—since it's infected so quickly—will disappear completely"" and that it could ""become a seasonal disease, every year comes back""."
The severity of the return will depend on the immunity of the animal and the extent of the infection.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and those infected may be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Relatively less common symptoms include shortness of breath, loss of smell, shortness of breath, pain in the muscles and unstable joints, sore throat, headache, body chills, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, or cyanoosis. WHO states that one in six people suffers from severe breathing difficulties.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, wakefulness and blue eyes or lips as urgent symptoms; it is recommended to seek medical help immediately if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so researchers have also advised people who have come in contact with infected people to monitor and test to avoid infection.
Chinese estimates of the symptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The range from one day to 14 days in the stage of general incubation (the period during which infections and symptoms begin; five consecutive days. In the example of uncertainty, initially the fraction of people with COVID-19 who had lost smell was estimated at 30% and later the figure of those who had lost 15%.
There is still some debate as to how the disease spreads.
It is thought that the disease is mainly spread by small droplets produced during close contact and when coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact means being between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that the particles from an open cough can range from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
According to some, the virus can also be infected by tiny droplets of liquid that can be formed while talking, which remain in the air for a long time. Respiratory laurels can also be formed during breathing, including when speaking, although the virus is usually not airborne.
Water particles can enter the mouth or nose of those who are nearby, or they can enter the lungs by inhaling them.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory discharge to become aerosol and result in airborne transmission.
It can spread even when someone touches any contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although this concern can be spread through feces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can be transmitted before and after symptoms appear.
Many people have tested positive three days before the onset of these symptoms, which suggests that it is possible to transmit the disease before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have detected asymptomatic infections during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person usually infects two to three people. The virus survives on surfaces for several hours to several days.
In particular, the virus was found in plastic (polypropylene) for three days, in 304 stainless steel, in cardboard for one day, and in copper for four hours.
It varies, depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as infected people have to do after touching other surfaces.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel and novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a team with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. The virus is killed by household soap outside the human body as it breaks down the protective opening of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a source of animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically linked with the strains found in two bats in subgenus cerecovirus (Linease B) with the genus Batacronavirus.
In the coronavirus sample of other bats (BatCov RaTG13) the level of the entire genome is exactly one of 96%.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the virus in the wild and the virus in the human body.
Compared to the entire genome so far, it has been found that 92% of the genetic material is similar to that between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the forestry served as a host in the middle.
The infection can be diagnosed via the virus depending on the symptoms temporarily, but ultimately confirm the reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected salivary glands.
A study comparing PCR with Wuhan CT suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less precise, than PCR, and many of the features of taking pictures of it coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis""."
The WHO has released several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on a breathing or blood sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on top of a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used. A few laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect antibodies.
None of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for extended use as of April 6, 2020.
In the United States, serological tests made by Chellex have been approved to be used only by authorized laboratories in emergencies.
Characteristic features of taking photos in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and the absence of pleural efusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images obtained from the trial of confirmed cases.
For mixing with other infections such as adenoviruses, the PCR has restricted the formation of any images and the detection of COVID-19 without any confirmation.
A large study in China compared PCR with chest CT results and explained that, although imaging of the infection is less specific now, it is faster and more sensitive to what it suggests to be considered a screening device in a pandemic-stricken region.
Artificial intelligence-based mutations have been created by the birth agency that produces the characteristics of the virus through radiographs and CTs.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall personal good hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, sneezing or coughing in tissue, and throwing that tissue into a garbage container.
Those who are already infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have advised against or controlled all non-essential travel from countries and territories affected by the outbreak.
The virus has spread to large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some people in the community do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare providers serving someone who may have been infected are recommended to use evidence-based precautions, contact alerts, and eye protection. It is very important for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to find people who have come in contact to prevent further infection.
The administration's use of mobile phone location information for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for limiting such surveillance.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to log in to mobile phones of others near one user.
Users will then receive a message if they come in contact with a person who is COVID-19 positive. There are several misconceptions surrounding how to prevent the infection. For example, washing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are working to create one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people should occasionally wash their hands with soap and water for at least a second, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are apparently dirty; before eating; before coughing, or while sneezing.
Since the virus can be killed by domestic soaps outside the human body, which repels the protective bubble of the virus.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available near the hands, at least 60% of alcohol-containing sanitizers can be used instead.
The WHO has advised people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be contaminated with a few solutions (within a minute of exposure to disinfectants in the case of stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–10%) isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxydine gluconate are relatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a place such as an office or daycare, the ATM machine used by offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their face and nose elbows during coughing or sneezing or cover the tissue with paper and immediately drop the tissue properly.
Those who are at risk of being infected are advised to wear surgical masks. Wearing a mask can control the amount of water particles emitted during sneezing or coughing and the extent of spread.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""wearing a mask can reduce the tendency to touch people's faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."""
The WHO has advised healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have started encouraging people to use face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a face non-medical mask made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when approaching other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has advised people to wear a surgical mask while traveling on public transport or in public places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to wear a mask or cover your nose and mouth when going out.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when traveling to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has issued an order that a face mask must be worn when entering every grocery store.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask whenever they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing nearly a million masks per day since mid-March, requires passengers to wear masks on trains and interstate buses to travel on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask when going out, and has advised people who can't buy face masks to wear a homemade face mask.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes reducing close contact between individuals, slowing the spread of the disease, and controlling the spread of infection.
Methods include: being quarantined; limiting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shop-markets.
Individuals can apply social distancing procedures by limiting travel, staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, greeting people without touching them, and physically maintaining distance from each other.
Many governments are now making it mandatory or advising to maintain social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak of the disease.
The maximum size of the combination, according to U.S. government authorities and health institutions, quickly dropped from 250 people (if not known to have spread COVID-19 in the area) to 50 and later to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people in public. The association of older adults and the ""contagious"" means of keeping distance from the disease, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and other underlying medical conditions, such as damaged immune systems, has led to an increased risk of serious illness and complications in the WDC homes, and has made it possible for them to stay at home in the outbreak areas in the society."
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has affected people in such a way that it has led to complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to maintain contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic."
This includes advice only to have sex with someone who lives with you, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those who are infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine for all residents living in the affected areas.
The most stringent guidelines for self-quarantine have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with people with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread infection have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible contact time.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment and mitigation measures.
Suppression is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak, and aims to detect and isolate infected people in order to stop the spread of the disease among the remaining population, as well as to introduce and immunize other infection control measures.
When it is not possible to sustain the spread of the disease in any other way, the efforts go to the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken to slow down the spread a bit and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and society.
At the same time, both containment and mitigation may have to adopt a mixed standard.
More extreme measures need to be taken to reduce the number of primary reproductions to less than 1. Reducing the maximum number of epidemics is part of the response to the outbreak of an infectious disease, known as the flattening of the pandemic curve.
It reduces the risk of getting infected and gives more time for vaccinations and for better treatment.
Other ways other than medication that can control the outbreak include taking personal preventive measures, such as hand-cleaning hygiene, wearing face masks, and quarantining yourself to prevent the spread of the virus; maintaining physical distancing was followed by the introduction of whole-of-house measures, such as keeping schools closed and canceling public gatherings; also involving public gatherings to acknowledge and participate in such other measures, such as environmental measures.
Other countries have also adopted a number of standards to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass testing and local quarantines, and issued a warning on the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and increased the fines for medical supplies fraud. The vibrancy of efforts by Great Britain and the United States proves that there is a major challenge in mitigation (slow down but not preventing the spread of the pandemic) and suppression (increased anti-pandemic).
While the policies of the highest possible mitigation are able to reduce the highest demand for healthcare by 2/3rds and deaths by half, health systems are still grappling with the consequences of millions of deaths.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it is necessary to maintain it for as long as the virus continues to circulate among the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), as the system is relaxed otherwise the virus infection returns quickly.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic damage.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop, including testing of existing drugs.
Consuming over-the-counter cold-inflamed drugs, drinking fluids, and taking rest can relieve symptoms.
Depending on how severe the illness is, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids (via the vein) and breathing aid may be needed.
The use of steroids can lead to worse results.
Multiple compounds approved for the treatment of other viral diseases in the past are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" help relieve the symptoms that appear as a result of SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and the acquisition of health centres for COVID-19 patients has been initially described by the WHO as a preventive measure to prevent the outbreak of the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary medical delivery centers that must remove sources at a multi-layered scale and which include increasing the focus of the enforcement towards testing for COVID-19, increasing the number of intensive surveillance by isolating and keeping COVID-19 positive patients and training staff, and the number of available ventilation and beds, etc.
There are various theories as to where the first case (the so-called Patient Zero) might have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was detected on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei was gradually increasing.
Most of these were related to the Huanan marine food wholesale market, where even living animals were sold, and according to a theory the virus came from one such animal; or otherwise, it has an animal origin. On December 26, a pneumonia cluster of unknown causes was observed and Dr. Zhang Jijian (Zhang Jixian) was treated at Hubei Provincial Hospital in Wuhan on December 27.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, I-Fen, was reprimanded by his high-ranking staff for expressing alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
In early January, some cases of unknown pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, which is under investigation. At the initial stage of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-2020, with the help of Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major rail junction, the virus spread to other regions of China.
On January 20, China announced that about 140 new cases were detected in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The next official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already had symptoms. As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy to have seen the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
At least one case was reported in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area limit free movement and impose control at the border.
The national response includes some repressive measures such as isolating everyone (called stay-at-home orders or shelter orders or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some kind of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion two days later - almost one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, but according to an unconfirmed report, a case was first detected on November 17.
Dr Zhang Jijian noticed a cluster of pneumonia for unknown reasons on December 26, after which his hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
They were told the same day.
"After the notifications were published, the police were warning doctors in Wuhan of ""spreading rumours"" about the outbreak."
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign that later described as a ""people's war"" to contain the spread of the virus."
"A Cordon sanitiser was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, described as the ""biggest quarantine in human history"", which was expanded to 15 cities in Hubei and affected a total of about 57 million people."
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations have been canceled in many places.
Officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
After Leishenshan Hospital, another hospital was built to take care of additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China turned 14 other centers in Wuhan, such as the Convention Center and Stadium, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took measures in the interest of taking additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including a health declaration for tourists and an extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, especially in the case of schools and universities.
Remote work was carried out in many regions of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed on inside and outside of Hubei.
Public transport across China has been changed and museums have been temporarily closed.
"Controls were imposed on public movement in many cities and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on movement outside. After the outbreak entered the global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being ""imported"" from other countries."
For example, Beijing has declared it mandatory for all international travelers entering the city to self-isolate for 14 days. Five days before March 23, only one case has been infected domestically in mainland China. It is found in a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Two months after the lockdown was imposed, restrictions on travel to Hubei were eased on the same day in addition to Wuhan. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry permit for people holding visas or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, and no specific details were given as to when the policy would expire.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese administration encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and provided financial stimulus packages for companies. The State Council announced a day of mourning that began at 4 April 10:00 a.m. with three minutes of nationwide silence, the day the Qingming festival was also held, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online while maintaining physical distancing to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to Daegu's new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of the Jews.
Visitors to the Shinchangji Church, which had come from Wuhan to visit Daegu, were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
Of the 9,336 followers of the church on February 22, 1,261 reported symptoms, or about 13%. South Korea announced the highest level of warning on February 23, 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three people tested positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected and therefore changed. South Korea launched a program to test people for the virus and isolate infected people, and to find and quarantine those they came in contact with, which is considered the world's largest and best-organized program.
Screening methods such as reporting your own symptoms to new international arrivals by mobile apps, driving thru tests of the virus that can be found the next day, and testing the capacity of 20,000 people per day need to be increased.
Although cities are not fully quarantined, programs in South Korea have been considered a successful program in preventing the outbreak. South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions claiming that the outbreak has been officially abused and calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day cases in a total of four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks starting April 1.

Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between different cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities as the Persian New Year was ahead of Nowruz.
Shia religious sites in Com were open until 16 March 2020. Iran became the epicentre of the virus outbreak after China in February.
In the midst of demands to curb outbreak levels in Iran, more than ten countries found Iran as the source of their infections by February 28, indicating that the outbreak levels were much higher than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government as of that date.
On March 3, 23 of the 290 members of Iran's parliament tested positive for the virus.

It has also been suggested that the US sanctions on Iran may have undermined the country's financial capacity to deal with this infectious outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the lifting of economic sanctions for countries including Iran that have been hardest hit by the pandemic.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that "the outbreak has shown that in all places there will be no entry and exit routes."
"Protests have already been disrupted in those areas and sporting events have been suspended. ""On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities at the national level as Italy's death toll reached 100."

In Hungary, its parliament gives Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend parliament or conduct elections, and to punish the honorable people who spread misinformation about how the disease is transmitted and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for shortages of supplies, increased global use of materials needed to fight the pandemic, creating panic and disrupting factory and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased demand from buyers and disruptions from suppliers.
Shops were also seen in many areas due to panic, leading to people buying more essential grocery items such as food items, toilet paper and bottled water, which led to a shortage of groceries.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in sending electrical goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has increased the price by 20 times the normal price and delayed the delivery of medical supplies by six months.
It created a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned that it would put health workers at risk.
The pandemic in Australia provides a new opportunity for Daigou sellers to sell Australian goods in China.
The activity resulted in a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, ensuring an oversupply of food items, both regions have been able to keep themselves free from severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against stockpiling and illegal trade in essential goods have been successful, avoiding the acute shortage of food in North America without Europe.
Although there has been no significant decline in agricultural output in northern Italy, industry representatives said prices could rise.
When Chinese government officials gave up the pork they had stocked up on in order to provide sufficient nutrition to the population, they initially faced empty food shelves even in the city of Wuhan.
Italy has similar national laws that require food producers to stock up on food for such emergencies.
The damage to the world economy has also been felt in China: According to a March 16 media report, China's economy hit very strongly in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to slow the spread of the virus and retail sales fell 20.5%.
As China's mainland plays a key role in the economy and the center of production, the outbreak of the virus threatens to create a major destabilizing situation for the world's economy.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's Agathe Demarais predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture is released on the possible outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic disaster caused by the pandemic in global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the world's supply chain has suffered more than $300 billion in losses that could last up to two years.
"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ""knocked down"" after falling oil prices due to low demand from China."
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 outside Mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, multiple U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest decline since 2008, with Dow Dow wearing 1,191 points, the biggest one-day fall since the financial crisis of 2007–08.
The three indexes fell more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Fearing the coronavirus, the stock market crashed again, with the biggest drop on March 16.
Many people are concerned about the possibility of an economic downturn.
Economist Muhammad El-Arian praised the central bank and the state's timely emergency measures.
Central banks are dealing with a faster pace than they were in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected departments due to the government's ban on all popular places including tourism, attractive tourist destinations and any type of travel around the world.
As a result, multiple airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, canceled flights for relatively low demand, after the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The tremendous impact that has been seen in the maritime travel industry has never been seen before.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
During the Chinese New Year holiday, the main season of travel to China, called Chunyun, began, at which time the epidemic began in China.
Many events where there may be a lot of public gatherings, such as the annual New Year's celebrations, have been closed by national and regional governments. Private companies are also closing their shops on their own and closing various attractive tourist destinations such as Hong Kong's Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many lunar New Year celebrations and tourist gatherings, including the forbidden city and traditional temple fairs in Beijing, have been closed to prevent mass gatherings.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended New Year's holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to its infectious disease to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's celebrations. The global retail sales sector has been hit by the decline or temporary closure of shops.
Sales in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
As a result, the number of buyers in shopping centers declined by 33–43% in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall managers imposed additional measures, such as increasing the health system, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancelling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession triggered by the global pandemic could put 14 to 22 million more people into extreme poverty than it would have been had the global pandemic not existed in Latin America.
Nearly 5 million people lost their jobs in the final phase of the pandemic in Wuhan in January and February 2020.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland areas or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 47 million people in the United States could lose jobs due to the coronavirus outbreak and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has resulted in the loss of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (those who have been paid wages/labourers per day since March 2020) who have become unemployed. An Angus Red Institute survey found that 44% of households are unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for a universal credit scheme. About half of Germany’s half a million companies sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-time work plan known as Kurtzerbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals - both employed and individual - globally.
The institutions of art and culture sought to maintain their own (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage in the community, to maintain the safety of their own workers and people, and to support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters, and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely, canceling or delaying their exhibitions, events, and performances.
There was intense effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms in response. Another recent and fast-growing consequence of the disease was the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and concerts and other social events such as concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also saw a breakdown, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of the last week of the Christian Lent holiday in Rome.
Many dioceses have advised older Christians to stay at home instead of coming on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming, or television, while others have been organizing worship services instead of getting out of the car.
With the closure of its churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome and the nullification of the Christian Pilgrims of St. Peter's Square, other religious boards have also cancelled services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurudwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and religious sites were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia also banned foreign pilgrims from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as well as residents of the country.
The pandemic is one of the most significant disruptions to the global sporting calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been canceled or postponed.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be ""rescheduled at any date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021""."
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups on gambling sites suggest that many gamblers have moved online as a result. In order to postpone or cancel the tours of various music groups, the entertainment industry has also been affected.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"" so that artists could perform, distribute and promote their work."
On the internet, the theme of the coronavirus has spread to memes on the internet, which is very funny and removes the focus from this uncertain time.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and also against people from hotspot areas in Europe, the United States and other countries, has been seen to increase, unnecessary fear of foreigners and racism.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific, there have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Reports of cases found since February have documented racist attitudes toward groups of Chinese people around the world, claiming that they deserve or that what is being done to them is a fair revenge.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei said they had been discriminated against based on regional etymology.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and there was also support for the people of the virus-affected region.
Experienced Italians, as the first country in Europe to experience the dreaded COVID-19 outbreak, according to the progress of the outbreak in the new hotspot countries, can be a source of suspicion and alienation. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed petitions/applications initially to urge Chinese people to ban entry into their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, this hash tag became very popular in <0x23>ChineseKingJapan.
Attacks against Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States are reported to be on the rise.
"US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"", as critics see the phrase as racist and anti-Chinese."
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian residents and passengers returning from Wuhan to Nabi Sanjahari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in major cities in India have reportedly been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"Dilip Ghosh, the chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and ""that's why God took revenge against them."""
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata has strongly criticized the comment and described it as "misleading". Genophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have increased during this pandemic. Here foreigners have been described as "foreign garbage" and have been identified as "exclusions".
There are some other newspapers, including Paywall, that have removed them from their partial or complete coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have created science-related articles that are available in open access.
Some scientists prefer to quickly publish their results on some innovative servers, such as BioRoxy.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods that detect the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance on the public.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including people who were too insignificant to report symptoms or who were symptomatic.
From the results of this test, a correct mortality rate of the disease and group immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the outbreak of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of their population, and there are huge variations in how many tests have been conducted across different countries.
This difference will likely significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
With nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples, respiratory samples obtained through various methods can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a sore throat swab is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may disappear from the throat at a later time, but the number in the lungs may continue to increase.
In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material can be taken from the deep of the trachea by the suction catheter, or the object (pituitary) emitted with the cough can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-stage SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
"This is the discovery of the common ""E"" gene and the RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 in all beta coronaviruses. The BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to receive the emergency use authorisation of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Clinical Products Administration (CRIS-CoV) in 2019."
In one of the three genetic tests of older versions of the test kits, faulty reagents caused unconfirmed results and an obstacle to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed on an average day throughout February 2020.
The tests using the two components were not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration) under an emergency use authorization. U.S. business labs began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests on the basis of RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made nationwide COVID-19 testing available on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out as per CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test in Russia was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could have performed more than 3.5 hours, thus allowing a 24-hour test to be performed in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for an experiment on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar approval to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for a similar test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved an experiment that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, this method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S., and Abbott hopes to increase production to deliver 50,000 tests per day. One test uses a monoclonal antibody, which is precisely bound to the new coronavirus' nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and is exactly what a rapid influenza test is supposed to do in 15 to 20 minutes so it can produce results with this test.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that ""the importance of chest radiographs in the early stages is very low in diagnosis, but data from CT [computed tomography] may even be present even before the onset of symptoms."""
CT's features include a two-sided, multilobar ground-glass opacification with an edge, opaque and backward distribution.
With the emergence of the disease, subplural domains, Crazy Paving and Consolidation appear.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan, the epicentre of the current pandemic, suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less precise, than PCR, and many of the features of taking pictures of it coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 sorting or for diagnosis""."
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infections in people starting from 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and to monitor the public. Evaluations can be carried out by point-of-care testing, PoCT, in central laboratories (CLT) and in care centres.
High-performance automated systems in many essential laboratories will be able to perform this task, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although successive samples can also be used to follow an immune response.
In general, a single sample of blood is taken by piercing the skin for PoCT.
A drawdown step is not required before an exam like the PCR procedure. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 organizations that had provided the agency with the notification as needed and are now able to distribute their antibody tests for that reason.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved under an emergency use authorization by the FDA. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability of the test is hundreds of samples in a few hours, and therefore much faster than the traditional PCR assessment of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK found that any antibody test kits they purchased were not good enough to use.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, drive it back, and get the test results a little later. The British NHS has announced that they are launching a plan to test the suspected cases at home, or eliminate the risk of infecting other people if the patient goes to a hospital."
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive test of any country. The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that they had the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in the traveling setting and 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is on the order of a doctor, health insurance costs.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive-in tests were provided in many major cities.
The total number of tests completed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"In a first lab study, it was revealed that at least 483,295 samples were tested in a total of 483,295 samples were tested in the 12/2020 calendar week, including 10,000 samples on 12/2020, and in the trial, 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital tested one sample from 64 patients together.
Modelling the construction work supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed within 5 days showed that if the testing capacity did not increase in time, the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the associated costs of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Huo-Yan Labs quickly followed Wuhan Laboratory in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As of 4 March 2020 the testing capacity was a total of 50,000 per day. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays have been released that can test a maximum of 1122 patients samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, the lack of reagents and insufficient amounts of reagents had become a limitation on mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some researchers to explore sample preparation protocols where samples were heated for 5 minutes at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more people for the coronavirus than any other country and is on track to raise the testing level to reach the majority of the population.
"This was done through the combination of drive-through capabilities and the purchase of a population-scale laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of times more RT-PCR tests per day, and is the first in the world to do so outside of China.
Testing methods were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The German system of production of kits was adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for low-income countries that did not have the resources to manufacture their own kits.
The German system was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control (U.S. Centers for Disease Control) was not available until 28 January, which delayed tests available in the U.S. There was a problem between China and the U.S. with the reliability of test kits that were unable to be tested in the early stages of the disease outbreak, and the recommendations were made to meet the needs of these countries and Australia by adequate testing by health experts.
In contrast, experts say that greater testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has for years developed the ability to test mainly in private sector labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to the creation of millions of test-due work in private U.S. labs, and pressure on the supply of swabs and chemical breakers.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits.
"There were ""errors"" in the test kits prepared by the CDC in the United States; the administration then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing." Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect."
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of collecting samples or failing to use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would withdraw the wrong resulting kits, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test kits purchased from China the wrong result. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
"The prime minister proposed to throw them into the Danube River. Atesh Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had ""high rate of error"" and that they had ""not used them"". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced that they were not usable in early April 2020."
Testing and then quarantining those who tested positive and finding those who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people had positive results.
The first death toll from COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in the Italian city of Vow, conducted a two-stage trial over a nearly ten-day interval over the entire population of 3,400 people.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all of the identified people were quarantined.
Controlling traffic in the community has completely eliminated the new infection.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, with no extreme controls such as aggressive detection, inbound travel control, testing and quarantine, but forced closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after a holiday break on March 23.
Several other countries have also controlled the global pandemic by aggressively detecting, quarantining, inbound travel control, testing, and quarantine of people who have come into contact, but with less aggressive lock-downs, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more than the number of deaths had a much lower mortality rate, as these countries were probably able to identify patients with mild or no symptoms as well.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capabilities and national laboratories have limited experience regarding COVID-19 should send the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"The ""what percentage of the test is positive"" column in the following chart is influenced by the test policy of that country."
In a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the positive percentage will be higher than in a country where everything else is the same, whether people have symptoms or not, all citizens are tested.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of washing a person's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
"Recent hand washing with soap at certain ""important moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the feces - the mouth."
People may also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments of the day when washing hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s lower back or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or giving him raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or after cleaning the child who has used the toilet.
After your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the healthy habits associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or taking medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep the hands clean from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harmful or disease.
This is especially important for people who care about or work in the medical field, but it is also an important method for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate during delivery at home.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing habits could lead to short-term improvements in length growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children with respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from this disease by about 50%.
Adopting measures that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap has been linked to a 48% reduction in diarrhea cases. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) performed as an automatic practice in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years old. It takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children every year.
Pneumonia and diarrhoea are the leading cause of death for 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, a change in the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reduce diarrhoea deaths by almost half, and reduce deaths by a quarter from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is integrated with other sanitation systems as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing protects against infectious skin disease (Impetigo) that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the less harmful effects of hand washing is frequent hand washing, which can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, skin-chilling condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five important times of the day when washing your hands with soap are: after using the bathroom (diabetes, defecation), after cleaning the baby’s lower back or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handing in raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when the correct hand washing technique should be applied to prevent the transmission of the disease include before and after treatment of cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or rubbing the animal; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households are accustomed to hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that the country had the highest rate of prescribed hand washing in the country at 97 percent; the United States averaged around 77 percent of the daily practice of hand washing in the United States; and China had the lowest rate of 23 percent of the daily practice of hand washing in times of crisis. Now a number of existing habits have undergone several changes to increase the habit of hand washing habits with soap.
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"" implemented by the Education Department of the Philippines is an example of adequate measures to promote children's health and education."
The main thing of such a program is to disinfect twice a year, as well as wash your hands with soap every day, brush your teeth with fluoride every day.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
By adding soap or detergent to the water, the elimination of microscopic organisms from the skin increases.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the resistance of the solution and increase the solubility.
Just because water is an ineffective skin cleanser (skin cleanser) is fat and protein, which is organic soil material, not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is done with the help of clean water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria from previous use.
A small number of studies that looked at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer was less likely because the bacteria were washed away with foam.
"The CDC still states that ""it is recommended to apply liquid soap that can be controlled without the use of hands""."
There has been a lot of publicity to the health conscious public about antibacterial soaps.
To date, no evidence has been found of the use of antiseptic or disinfectant recommended for nature's antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients, such as triclosan, which has the ability to resist organism at higher levels.
Thus, while antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting ingredients, in sophisticated preparations, the pH regulator of the antimicrobial formulations has removed the active beta-carotene residues (acidic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and extra-skin conditioners (aloeuvres, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) from the University of Oregon School of Public Health.
Warm water is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
But to eliminate the natural oils that hold the soil and bacteria, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hand.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic that is not water-based is a hand-cleaning material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based non-alcoholic rubber hand cleaning ingredients (also known as alcohol-based rubber, antiseptic hand rub, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol prepared together with thicker ingredients such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) or humectants such as glycerin in liquids or foams to reduce the ease of use and the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding mixed hydrogen-peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol which is efficient at killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitiser contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) after 30 seconds of application in the hand and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria after 1 minute of application in the hand. Hand sanitizers are the most effective against bacteria and are less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, almost completely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) type of virus. Adequate hand antiseptic or alcohol rubs should be used to quell or advance the two hands well.
The liquid, foam or gel is rubbed in the front and back of both hands and the middle of the fingers and the end edge for about 30 seconds until it dries.
Abrasive fingerprints with palms of both hands also need to be washed very well. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands well with hand sanitizer rubs, especially when hand dirt is seen.
The increasing use of these ingredients depends on their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microscopic organisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing if soap and water are not available.
If the emollients and/or skin moisturizers are not attached to the formula, frequent use in alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing gentle ingredients in medical tests caused significantly less tension and dryness on the skin than soap or disinfectant detergents.
Hypersensitivity to allergen-related skin diseases, contact-related gum disease, or associated objects present in alcohol or alcohol, alcohol hand rubs occur very rarely.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, the lower tendency to initiate painful touch dermatitis became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, the water-less material does not clean the organic matter of the hand, but only disinfects the hand.
Since the pathogen is still out of hand, this is why effective hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends more on the material and preparation, and in the past, alcohol and alcohol have worked significantly less than rubber.
More recently, the application of benzalkonium chloride user preparation has shown a steady and incremental antimicrobial activity that is not the same as alcohol, which has probably been shown to decrease effectiveness after repeated use due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
In a low-income society, many people do not have enough money to spend on soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because it makes alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap.
The correct hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent infection include the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot water.
Water is recommended because the permanent basin may be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap and soap on the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Hold for at least 20 seconds.
Abrasion occurs during scrubbing, which removes germs from the skin and removes more germs in the abrasion for a long time.
Wash well in water.
Washing hands in the basin can be re-polluted.
Dry with a clean towel or allow it to dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily re-contaminated. The places that are most left out are the places between the fingers, the wrists, the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can give shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended so that the hands do not become dry; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of spreading infection.
"In developing countries where tap tap water and/or soap are not available, a variety of low-cost options can be created for hand washing facilities, such as hanging jars or using appropriate holed lava to pour water and/or ash as needed. In limited water supply situations (such as schools in developing countries or rural areas), there are other water-saving options such as ""TP-taps" and ""low-water conservation""."
Tippi-tap is a simple technology where a leg-operated lever and a piece of soap are used to pour a jug and a small amount of water in the hand.
Hand-drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective type of drying in a public bathroom.
An increasing amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers seen in many washrooms.
A study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London in 2008 to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers, and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the finger and 254% on the palm of the hand.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increases the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on the finger and 15% on the palm of the hand.
After washing hands with paper towels, on average, up to 76% of the total bacteria in the fingers and 77% in the palms of the hands were reduced. As a result of each type of drying method, scientists also tested to see if there was a possibility of cross-contamination from other washroom users and the washroom environment.
The jet-air dryer, which emits air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow out microorganisms from hands and units and remove the possible pollution of the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 m.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer diffuses the microscopic organism up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant prevalence of micro-organisms. A study conducted in 2005 by Tove Product und Umwelt (T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt) evaluated the method of drying different hands.
The following changes have been observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with drying with paper towels.
Hand washing is an alternative to using hand sanitizing wipes when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was made mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the effectiveness of hand washing (1846) to prevent disease in the hospital environment.
There are some electronic devices that give a feedback to remind hospital staff to forget to wash their hands.
One study found that the rate of infection was reduced by the use of them.
Medical hand-washing is carried out for a minimum of 15 seconds and each part of the hand uses sufficient soap and water or gel to remove the abrasive foam.
The fingers should be glued together.
A bristle brush can be used to remove it if there is dirt under the nails.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to thoroughly wash off the foam and dry it with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water faucet (and open another door to exit if necessary).
This can prevent contamination of the hands again from these surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove disease-causing pathogens (""bacteria"") and avoid infection."
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the shortage of hand washing in most medical environments remains at an unacceptable stage, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus leading to microbial infections.
One study found that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow transmission by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published the standard hand-washing and hand-waving paper in the Department of Health Care.
Guidelines on hand hygiene can also be found on its website by the organization for public comments.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if regulatory follow-up verification is required.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has ""five moments"" for hand washing:
After coming into contact with blood/body fluid
prior to the outbreak of the disease, and
"After the patient is taken care of, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (""medication"" or ""antimicrobial"" soap) gives the ability to destroy the hand wash material."
Before surgical treatment or in places where there is an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant organisms, it may be desirable to have a call to ‘scrub’ your hands for surgical work that can be turned on and off without touching your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine-free device to wash your hands, other disinfectant soaps and scrubs for washing your hands after washing.
All the ornaments must be opened.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub the hands for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, the water from the palm of the hand to the elbow must be prevented from turning back to the palm of the hand.
After hand washing is finished, the hands are washed with disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or use hand antiseptic.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing was from washing the first 20%, and the additional benefit was found very little when the repetition of hand washing was increased above 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap as compared to washing with antibacterial soap resulted in three times the rate of bacterial infectious disease circulating in food. The alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap over a period of 30 seconds showed a reduction of 26% in each of the antibacterial soaps by comparing the hand-wrinkle with the alcohol-based solution.
However, soap and water/water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rub to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium difficile seeds from hand to hand. Hand washing to improve hand hygiene in health care environments, the education of staff and the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs and staff written and oral reminders may be involved.
More research is needed on which of these improvements are most effective in different healthcare environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, vital way to achieve good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces creates a challenge for achieving universal hand washing habits.
For example, while there are cheaper options to create a hand wash space in most areas of rural Africa, there are very few hand washing faucets near every private or public toilet.
However, low hand washing rates may be due to a deeply entrenched habit rather than a lack of soap or water/water.
The promotion and advice of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to changes in people's long-term habits.
In order for it to work effectively, it needs to be monitored and evaluated.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods at LMIC are effective in hand washing, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of a campaign on hand washing in schools is UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" that encourages schools to take simple, affordable steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other healthful requirements."
If the minimum standards are achieved, schools can reach one to three stars in the end.
Setting up a hand washing station can be a part of helping to promote the hand washing campaigns that are conducted to reduce disease and child mortality rates.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that are trying to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of hand washing emojis.
DALYs has considered a number of studies on the overall cost savings of hand washing in developing countries on prevention.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is comparatively more affordable than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as mothers in hospital who have just given birth or wounded soldiers - was first recognized by two practitioners of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, a ""modernist nurse"" in the English establishment."
By that time most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called Myasmus.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of diseases caused by food and healthcare-related infections led the United States to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has raised awareness of the importance of hand washing with soap in many countries to protect themselves from this type of infectious disease.
"In Germany, for example, posters with ""correct hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets next to hand washing sinks."
"The phrase ""throwing a person's hand"" means expressing the person's unwillingness to take responsibility for the matter or to be a partner in wrongdoing."
It originates from the biblical part of Matthew where Pontius Pilatus cites the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a language manifestation by more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up the imaginary stain by exposing her sense of guilt about the crime she had committed and inducing her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, when thinking about or thinking about immoral acts, are more prone to hand washing than others and are more prone to paying higher prices to hand washing equipment.
"In addition, those who have been allowed to wash their hands after such intent are less likely to engage in other ""cleaning"" compensatory activities, such as volunteering."
Religions command hand washing for both healthy and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water/water for hand washing, but not using soap, is a part of religious practices featured in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, Tevilah in Judaism, and the Natalat Yad<0xC4><0xAB>m, the Lavabo in Christianity, and the Ozu in Islam. The practice of washing hands after some work is particularly healthy.
After using the toilet, it is mandatory for Hindus, Jews and Muslims to wash their hands.
And, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Work-at-home risk management for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health procedures for risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls in the workplace depend on the place of work and the work to be done, based on a risk assessment of the sources of contact, the severity of the disease in public, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be at risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposures include minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which general infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging staff to stay home if they are sick, clean respiratory etiquette, and regular work environment.
Medium-risk exposure jobs include jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but require frequent or close contact with people who may have been infected due to the ongoing disease spreading within the community or due to international travel at the place of business.
This includes employees who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, in high-density work environments, and in a somewhat overcrowded retail range.
In addition to early infection prevention measures, hazard control measures for these groups include using advanced capacity air filters to keep ventilation, snooze guards and personal protective equipment available when facing a person infected with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers the risk of health workers and morgue workers coming into contact with people who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19. The risk increases if these workers apply aerosol-generating procedures or through the process of collecting or handling samples of people with COVID-19 who have any confirmed or suspected cases.
The appropriate risk controls for these employees include engineering controls such as negative pressured ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for job work.
The COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace can have many effects.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, to care for others, or for fear of possible contact.
There is a demand for products and the way to buy these products (such as shopping at a time when there is no engagement, or through delivery or drive-through services (not buying from the car), can change in both directions.
Finally, sending goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be hindered. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used to guide protective measures.
The plans address various workplace and work-related risk levels, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and society range, and personal risk factors for employees, such as old age or chronic medical disease.
They also described the necessary controls to address those risks and plans to be prepared for situations that may arise as a result of the disease outbreak.
Preparatory and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing the adverse impact on other companies in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses received.
Risk control is a framework that is widely used to control occupational safety and health performance.
While the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, and implementing it can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls are changes to work-related policies or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk of the worker, such as fitting as applicable (such as respirators), wear consistently and appropriately, inspect, maintain and replace regularly, and properly open, clean, and store or cancel to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure involves minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues.
The basic steps recommended for all workplaces include frequent and well-ventilated hand washing, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory hygiene, tissue and garbage disposal including covering their mouth during sneezing and coughing, maintaining clean and hygienic facilities, telecommunication or other equipment at different times of the day, making it possible for staff to get ready for other activities.
An essential step in keeping employees, customers, interviewees and others safe in the workplace is to quickly identify and isolate potentially infected people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness to stay at home, as long as they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying drugs, and should be flexible on sick leave policies that allow employees to take care of these sick family members at home.
According to OSHA, medium-risk exposure jobs include jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within six feet (1.8 m) of close contact due to ongoing illness spreading among the public at the place of business or due to recent international travel to a place where COVID-19 has spread widely.
It includes personnel with whom there is public contact, such as COVID-19 in schools, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace and in the workplace.
Employees in this risk group are required to use a respirator in rare cases.
If a person falls ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect staff and other passengers include separating sick people from others at a distance of 6 feet, specifying a staff member to serve the sick person, giving the sick person a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue while coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to the sick traveler's call or touching the body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or shortness of breath, perhaps additional personal protective equipment should be used.
Gloves and other discarded items should be discarded in an organic risk bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including promotional vessels and other passenger vessels, risk controls include delaying travel when sick, keeping oneself isolated and informing the ship’s medical center immediately if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the ideal case, medical follow-up should be carried out in the cabin of the person who has been quarantined. In the case of school and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfecting if an infected person enters the school building, regardless of the spread of the disease in public.
When the disease spreads from the lowest to the middle, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as canceling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education or eating in concerted music classes or cafeterias; extending the distance between desks, separating office hours and holidays, limiting unnecessary meeting spaces, and children's fluency.
When the disease is widespread in the local community, the additional school closures of social distancing strategies may be considered. The immediate risk to health of law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact people who are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If staff come in close contact during the alarm, they should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment using a household cleaning spray or wipe before reusing, and follow the proof management procedures to control and cancel the PPE used.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and death-related services personnel to be in a high or very high risk category of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health care supplies, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who come into contact with patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If staff perform aerosol-generating procedures, or collect or manipulate samples from patients who are known to have or suspected to have COVID-19, they become at high risk of exposure.
Aerosol-generating methods include tube insertion, cough initiating methods, bronchoscopes, some dental procedures and testing or testing of materials to collect samples.
High exposure risk, death-related jobs include employees who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; this becomes very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls performed for people in these vulnerable groups include those who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 in isolation for patients who have been hospitalized.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and spaghetti environments.
The samples should be administered in accordance with the biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating incoming patients into individual waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. OSHA recommends respirators in addition to other PPEs for people who are known to have or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 and for people performing aerosol-generating procedures.
NIOSH-approved N95 or better filtering facepiece respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program, including health screening, training, and medical examinations in the United States.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, since COVID-19 is not transmitted through bodily fluids, but rather is a respiratory disease.
The WHO only recommends a surgical mask for screening staff at the entrance.
The WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gowns and gloves for those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures.
If an aerosol-producing process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
In view of the inadequate supply of PPE worldwide, WHO has advised the use of telemedicine, transparent windows to reduce the need for PPE, and has advised only those who are directly involved in the care of the infected person to allow one person to enter the room with COVID-19, and not to monitor the use of PPE only for specific purposes, to continue to provide PPE, without removing the use of respirators while caring for multiple patients with the same disease.

Topic: [Covid-19] To lighten the load and prepare for the future
Issue Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensed: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we are in a very difficult situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global phenomenon that makes clear the global human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the universal compassion, cooperation and society at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust and care we have seen through email, calls and chats among all our colleagues is a remarkable manifestation of the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as a partner.
Last week, a man shared his appreciation for our work with us.
They reminded me how meaningful it is to be able to see Wikipedia for the world at the moment and how powerful it is to be able to see this important resource online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether it’s to keep the sites up or to pay our colleagues or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will also have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, there will be some significant changes from this coming week in the way we work together.
Compatibility with our work and schedules
Just as Robin had previously mentioned, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and fix the schedule for the coming days and months.
We thought it was the right response to the situation we were facing, and we thought in that conversation about the best way to sustain the company during this time.
Most of us wanted to get rid of stress and support our goals for the long term.
There is no problem if you need to back up the dial.
For all employees, contractors, and contractual employees:
Until further notice our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work in a more normal time, the mission can put you to work.
But at the moment the world is uncertain, and whether you need to take care of your loved one or bring groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not looking at your time.
Don't work when you're sick.
It's hard to say, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team correct the calendars and schedules, to make sure the key areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can help and ensure that your situation gets proper attention from the authorities).
The workers will be paid full hourly wages.
We have already said, and we pledge once again to honour our commitment to our contractors and hourly colleagues.
All will be paid on the basis of the normal hours they work under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to drive their stress from the world around us to a certain direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager, so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential functions that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all of our departments to evaluate current goals and change our focus to collaborate on what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, only we will all focus on the most important projects.
It won't hurt if you slow down.
We don't plan to double the amount of work we do after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work within the deadline, which is no longer realistic.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and we will work to set new targets and deadlines where appropriate.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
In order to match our new reality and expectation of daily work hours, we also want to adjust the deadline for delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to offer an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which gives employees more time to prioritize essential work, take care of themselves and give them the opportunity to care for loved ones, while also accepting the demands of those who want to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks or need to do so.
This extension of the deadline greatly reduces the workload of the current plan and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and we will update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
I would like to thank the APP team for their leadership in this regard.
Position, contact and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we hired a team of disinfectants to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a virus-resistant solution of hospital-appropriate quality to disinfect every surface and lobby and elevator banks entering our floor.
The building is employing its own maintenance responsibility protocol user products that help in the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a place in Brooklyn.
Discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be adjusted, and wanted to give you some advice:
If the duration of the meeting is too long, limit it to one or two hours.
If more long sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into smaller portions over a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, keep an agenda and send the text materials in advance.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection, make the video by default.
Keep a lead to facilitate each meeting, ask someone to monitor the questions in the chat and keep an eye on the speaker list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Make use of your swatches for the swatches.
Join the <0x23>remoteities channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about sharing tasks.
The HR management team is looking at webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to help increase the amount of work distributed across the foundation.
This past week, we asked all community donors to cancel public events such as Editathan, which is funded by Wikimedia, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their agreed grant activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or modifying these goals.
This coming week we will be introducing additional guidelines for Wikimania and other regional and subject-oriented community conferences.
Depression is a disorder of general attitudes from the entire global community, but at the same time it seems to have both the ability and clarity to focus on their own communities.
In the coming days, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are all in this together and we can help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and get other vital information related to COVID-19 at the Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with personnel currently living in significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream or coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please do not hesitate to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help and coordinate as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, please email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abdication of our work and responsibility.
Rather, it is a recognition that our actions and responsibilities at the moment may have to be adapted in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need, and provide the services the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to help each other and create space for the important work that is going to come in the coming weeks and maybe even in the months ahead.
To do this, you need everyone’s support, and so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be healthy when you need it.

B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestinal cells.
ACE2 opposes the work of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II, and increases Ag(1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a place for some coronaviruses to enter cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme that lies on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal cyclin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose active site in the action of the enzyme is uncoated on the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as Sheddes, and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released through urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the membrane of cells related to the second type of alveolus in the lungs, small intestinal enterocytes, most of the arteries and veins of the endothelial cells and the mucous muscle cells of the arteries.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the counterbalance of ACE.
ACE divides the angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7).
ACE2 can distinguish a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, acellin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 neutral amino acid transporter regulates the membrane exchange of SLC6A19 and has been associated with heart failure.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More precisely, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the surface of the cell in the enzymatic domain of ACE2 leads to endocytosis and the displacement of both viruses and enzymes within the cell.
This entry process also requires the priming of S protein by the host serine protein TMPRSS2, its inhibition is under current investigation as a possible cure. This has helped some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in the cell may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of evidence ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""compared with the controls, the risk of pneumonia was significantly associated with a 34% reduction in the use of ACE inhibitors."""
"Moreover, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially in patients with high risk of stroke and heart failure."
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although its results were lower than those of the overall risk of pneumonia."""
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage and has appeared to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation of the pig's baby with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory symptoms.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of work is 30 minutes, also the duration of the effect (permanence) is 24 hours.
Various studies suggest that people who do not tolerate first-class renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or RAS inhibitors or have a disease where angiotensin II circulation is increased may have rheumatoid arthritis-respiratory dyspepsia.
"B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to identify contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying the person (""identity"") who has been in contact with an infected person."
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in a few areas and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been created for the creation of communication detection apps.
Privacy concerns have been expressed, especially about systems that work on the basis of identifying the geographical location of app users.
The relatively intrusive options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log the user's catch-up on other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an app together with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have come into contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used across more than 200 Chinese cities. An app called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The app is developed by a local information technology group, has been published as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia “Stop Corona!”, a Bluetooth-based app that aims to detect the manifestation of symptoms of a potentially infected person and provide a quick response from the healthcare authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been waiting for approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government announced that the connection search app is in the advanced stages of development and will be available to work within a few weeks. Similar apps (""StopCovid"") are planned in Ireland and France."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to launch a geofencing app for patients with COVID-19 disease living in Moscow to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including a lack of functionality when the app's acceptability is limited to a small fraction of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on which types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store by limiting them to ""government"" or otherwise named companies."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Those who promote privacy expressed their concern in the context of the vested interests of surveillance on the public using coronavirus apps, in particular, about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be finished after the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting this type of surveillance to 100.
The company announced eight conditions regarding the government project:
"The watchdog must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate""."
There should be a Sunset clause to increase monitoring and surveillance;
The use of data for the purposes of COVID-19 should be limited;
Protection of information and anonymity must be protected and protection must be demonstrated on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance had to be done to stop the phenomenon of discrimination and marginalization;
The purpose of sharing any data with third parties is to be made clear in the law;
Citizens should have the right to protest against abuse and protection against abuse.
"All ""relevant stakeholders"", including public health experts and marginal groups, will be required to participate. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohanhe Greengen) (RSF) have issued a checklist."
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to remove the traceable processes from the operating systems of these devices if they are no longer needed to solve the problem of constant surveillance.
Some countries used network-based monitoring instead of apps, which eliminates both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unclaimed location information have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all central server systems require access to private location data; multiple privacy-preserving systems have been created that only use central server for interconnection (see section below).
An appless system was used in South Korea for contact surveillance.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including transaction data on mobile device tracking and cards, and combined them to send notifications to potentially infected individuals via text messages.
In addition to using this information to warn of possible contact, the government has made location information available to the public, in which some things are approved due to far-reaching changes to the Information Privacy Act following the outbreak of MERS.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
Identifying privacy-protected communication with a real part of research education that has been around since at least 2013 is a well-established concept. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording the proximity of other cellphone users using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single code of conduct. Decentralized code of conduct includes decentralised privacy-preserving proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN) and other sensitive behaviours of mobile communication-detecting (PACT).
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and occurs within all matching devices.
The privacy group SafePaths is developing at MIT Media Lab, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques while collecting and using location or route interception data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a white paper called ‘Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic’, which was published in March 2020. Another similar effort was made by Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, the company that manufactures privacy technology.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of their information.
On April 5, 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was founded by some teams that aim to reduce fragmentation and enable the universal interoperability of identifying and alerting apps, which together with them are essentially the same procedures and large-scale overlapping behaviours that were necessary.
On April 9, 2020, Singapore's government announced that it had an open-source BlueTrace protocol that was being used by its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, respectively, announced an initiative to find people who have come into contact with them, which will protect privacy according to their demands, which works on the basis of a mix of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also released the details of the main technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three steps:
To enable governments to create privacy-preserving official apps to detect coronavirus, roll-out of tools
Integration of this functionality directly on iOS and Android: Google and Apple first distribute the system through operating system updates and later plan to solve take-up and continuous surveillance problems by removing it in the same way when disaster strikes.
B'drug repositioning (also known as re-profiling, re-profiling, new work-executive or palliative medicine) is an approved drug that is used to treat a disease or condition different from that originally intended for.
This is a path of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma infection. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drugs-specific proteins each containing multiple ligand binding sites.
By analyzing these binding sites, it provides a reasonable project to create an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 protein.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussen A., and others conducted a variety of candidate compound studies that were optimized and analyzed in his pre-clinical studies for the similarity of the skeleton of candidates by the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 anti-inflammatory drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York will begin on March 24. The FDA allows the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under emergency use authorization (EUA) on March 28.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only approved as experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to participate in clinical trials under the European Union.
"The CDC states that ""the use, dosage or stability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been proven."
"Doctors say they are using the drug ""because there is no other option""."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test about the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed Favipiravir to be ""clearly effective""."
In the middle of the 4 days, 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative, while 45 patients who did not receive it had an illness length of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia, conducted in Wuhan, half were given Favipiravir and half were given Umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is unsubstantiated and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy medicines from Japan to store and use the military to deliver medicines to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration to buy the drug. The drug may be less effective in the severity of the illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to conceive.
"A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs, concluded that ""no benefit could be observed."""
The drugs were planned to prevent HIV from being replicated by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism within the scientific community about using resources to change the purpose of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO includes lopinavir/ritonavir in international mutual support tests.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramexo- and in-vitro anti-coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and infections.
Some early pre-trial studies indicate that remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with additional severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for hospitalisation and venous delivery to people who are seriously ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began a trial for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial for the corticosteroid taken by Alvesco (cycloneide) of Teigen for the treatment of pre-existing coronavirus patients.
A type of trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients with severe, hospitalizations in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, a low molecular-weight heparin widely used to treat patients, encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines about its use.
A multi-centred study on the use of anoxaperin sodium in preventive and palliative drugs on 300 patients was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the customary scientific attention has been focused on rebuilding approved anti-poisoning drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with China's 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenvir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially new to treat COVID-19 include:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Testing is also going on in Italy and China. See also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a planned vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, multiple efforts are in progress to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the effective virus, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety research in April.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to substantial investment and research activities to create a vaccine.
Many companies are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI initiative to create vaccines was said to have the condition of speed, production capacity, large-scale application and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working towards research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform goals that have progressed to Stage I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus-borne carriers (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: Cansino Biology, Adenovirus type 5 vectors)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccinated individuals are in the early stages of improvement, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others, but all of them are derived from little publicly available data (as expected).
The Phase I-II test conducts early safety and immunogenicity tests, and is typically performed on more specific, placebo-controlled and multiple sites while determining a more precise, effective dose.
Phase III trials, including the vaccine's trial effectiveness for prevention and control groups, usually involve more participants, while monitoring adverse effects on optimal drug levels.
"From 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated (still under ""prenatal"" research)."
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular-binding vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to trigger immune response.
In Canada, around January 24, 2020, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Center (VIDO-Intervac) announced the start of work on a vaccine aimed at starting human-body testing in 2021.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was announced on 26 January 2020 and the vaccine development projects were announced at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Jansen is developing the Sevvy vaccine in a joint venture with his biotechnology partner Vacsart.
On March 18, 2020, the company announced a partnership with Emergency Bio Solutions Vexart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, Romania's Oncogene Laboratory published a short essay on the design of a vaccine of the same technology used for cancer neontigen vaccination therapy.

development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical tests and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Health Ministry announced that it is working on 11 isolates and it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine, albeit at a fast pace.
On March 12, 2020, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported on the development of molecules such as the coronavirus in part funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is being researched by the laboratory in July or August 2020 to plan human trials.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed to give Kurivac a "massive amount of money" to get a monopoly on the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly produce an mRNA-based vaccine.
mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical testing, and diagnostic tests are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, an Italian biotech company called Takis Biotech announced that they would have pre-diabetes test results in April 2020 and their final vaccine candidate could be tested in the human body in the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a research committee for COVID-19 vaccine, which included Institut Pasteur, Themis Science (Venezuela, Austria) with a total of US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are preparing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was made within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical defense against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian institutions and universities such as the University of Mexico and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and several new vaccines also have plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine called PittCoVac on rats, which states that ""the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines extracted by MNA had strong antigen-specific antibody response [in the case of rats] at the beginning of the 2nd week of vaccination."""
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
DNA will be designed using bacteriophage to replicate inside the human bacterium to prepare harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities created a unified resource to gain access to supercomputers from IBM, a combination of Cloud Computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some ticks have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can also have benefits outside of the disease that prevents them.
An effort is being made to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers for an additional invasive trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that the vaccines that are under development will not be safe or effective.
Early research evaluating the effectiveness of the vaccine in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human mammals indicates the need for biosafety-level 3 control levels and international coordination for the management of living viruses to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the detection and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
At the time of the outbreak of MERS, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed the first clinical trials in humans and has three more ongoing, all of which are viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-Vectared (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts are related to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases mild symptoms appear, but in some cases, its progress can lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads to humans through tiny sputum particles often caused by coughing, sneezing or speaking during initial close contact.
When sputum particles are produced during respiration, they usually fall to the ground or above the surface rather than spread over long distances.
People can become infected by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it is likely to spread before symptoms are revealed and at a later stage of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis is through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab.
Those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the general public to use masks vary, some authorities are recommending against their use, some are recommending their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and nausea; medical attention is advised immediately if these symptoms are present.
Relatively less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or neck pain may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been found to vary in percentage.
In China, some of the cases were initially seen only in chests and chests.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.
It's called the biotic phase.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are showing symptoms will see it within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that symptoms are not seen in everyone who is infected.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in infection is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests they may have a role in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who did not show symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases were symptomatic while in hospital.
On April 1, China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases among its daily cases; 130 out of 166 people infected that day (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both saliva and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
The mouth speaks louder than normal.
A study in Singapore found that small droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) as a result of a non-covered cough.
Although the virus is usually not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol infection may be possible and the air collector placed in the hallway outside the human home gave a positive sample of the viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory discharges to become airborne particles and result in airborne expansion.
While there is concern that it may spread through the stool, this risk is thought to be low. The virus is most contagious when symptoms appear in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms become apparent but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person usually infects two to three people. The virus lives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, up to one day on cardboard, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) were found to be detectable for up to three days and up to four hours at 99% copper.
It varies depending on temperature and humidity.
Soap and detergent can also be effective if used correctly; Saban products break down the fatty protection level of the virus, inactivate it, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the middle of two days after hospitalization began.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the highest total of the virus, and the sixth showed the highest total of the virus as the patient was tested on the second day.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to a team of patients with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus can be seen in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus dies in domestic soaps, which ruptures its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found in large amounts in the lung type II alveolar cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 to enter the host cell."
Acute cardiac injury was seen in 12% of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe diseases.
Cardiovascular symptoms are higher due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors of the heart.
ACE2 receptors move quickly to the heart and are involved in the heart.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to weak prognoses. Body-testing of people who died of COVID-19 has been associated with damaged diffuse alveolar lymphomas in the lungs (diffuse alveolar damage,DAD), and prophylaxis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 tends to move towards epithelial cells -ACE2, the link between the respiratory tract and the respiratory tract, acute COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-decompression monocytate and severe pulmonary pathology recuperation.
Lymphocytic infiltrators have been reported in the examination of the body.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The ideal method of testing is using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by the nephrogenic swab; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but these require two blood samples to be taken at a two-week interval and the results have a low immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of coronavirus and reveal genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infections by viruses.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and identify if a person had been infected in the past) were in preparation for development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience in the field of testing showed only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On March 21, 2020, the FDA in the United States approved the first localized breastfeeding test for use later that month. The guidelines for diagnosis published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend diagnostic features and methods for detecting infections based on epidemiological risk.
Bidirectional, multilobar ground-glass opacification with a marginal, uneven and backward distribution is common in early infection.
Depending on the progression of the disease, subplural predominance, irregular Paving (septal thickening of the lobule by filling the variable alveolar) and consolidation can be seen.
There is very little information available about pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological facts of the autopsy investigation are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation (pulmonary watering) and pulmonary sth
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Light Pneumonia: Pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large-scale atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multinucleated monster cells
Severe pneumonia: Damaged diffuse alveolar (DAD) with diffuse alveolar emitting substances.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia Sarano: organization of extracts in alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and practicing appropriate respiratory hygiene, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth while washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue during coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inner side of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends using cloth face coverings in public to limit transmission parts by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce contact with people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and canceling large gatherings.
The guidelines also include that people should stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from each other.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until 2021, a key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the pandemic peak, known as ""flattening the curve""."
The CDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after coughing, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol only when soap and water are not available. In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
The activation of antimicrobials in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antisepsis""."
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are driven by supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other affected critical organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of carrying the virus wear a mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory disorders, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Helpful treatment may be effective in people with similar symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to take care of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have organized the medical recommendations of various organizations at the free resource, IBCC.
There is no specific treatment for COVID-19 as of April 2020.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for initial use.
Caution must be exercised to reduce the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare environments when procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation are performed that can create airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping people in an airborne infection isolation room (AIR) in addition to using evidence-based precautions, touch-related precautions and airborne precautions. The CDC describes instructions for using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Recommended equipments are: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but are not guaranteed for label-specific use against certain biological elements.
If the mask is not found, the CDC recommends using face coverings or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are severe enough.
The type of respiratory support is being actively studied in people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for hospitalized people with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure to avoid intubation, with some evidence of this.
It is not known whether any of these two will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors choose to keep the invasive mechanical ventilation through it if available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are most common in older adults (those who are over 60 years old and especially those who are over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of health management to deal with the sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people infected with COVID-19 in hospitals are finally admitted to the ICU.
In COVID-19, acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) develops and mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP enabled ventilators are needed to maximize oxygen distribution, while on the other hand ventilators need to reduce the risk of associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High levels of PEEP may not be available in older ventilators.
Possible treatment studies began in January 2020 and clinical trials of several antiviral drugs are underway.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it may take up to 2021 to develop new drugs, several of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers will participate in potential treatment effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment where the person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been studied to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data and the potential risk of infection as a result.
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine when it comes to potential risks, it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analytics of cellphone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor infected people and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of individuals suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens and to enforce quarantine.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared integrated phone location information with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect the quarantine breaker.
"Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators told him that ""40 percent of people are walking anyway""."
The German government organized the 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia's President Kirsti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus worldwide.
People may feel sick from quarantine, travel restrictions, medical side effects, or fear of own infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic downturns are a perfect disaster for harming people's mental health and well-being."""
This disease, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases like common colds, can progress very rarely or with no symptoms.
Minor cases usually heal within two weeks, but it may take three to six weeks for those with severe or severe disease to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of information on COVID-19. In some men, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia and damage the lungs.
In the majority of severely infected people, COVID-19 acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) can rapidly increase which can cause respiratory disorders, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Among those hospitalized with COVID-19, an increase in blood clotting abnormalities, especially during the prothrombin period, has been specified in 6%, while abnormal kidney function has been observed in 4% of the group.
There has been an increase of liver enzymes (transaminases) in about 20-30% of people who have COVID-19.
According to the same report, the time between onset of symptoms and death, including five hospital admissions, was ten days.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a seven-day interval between hospitalization and death.
In a study of primary cases, the median time from the onset of symptoms to death, including a full six to 41-day period, was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of lung samples showed the damage of dispersing alveolar cells, including cell fibromyxoid extremities, in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytocytes.
The picture of the lungs is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% reported deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was marked by an increase in cardiac arrhythmias or troponin levels.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. The socioeconomic and availability of medical resources in a region can also affect mortality.
The mortality rate from this disease varies not only due to regional differences, but also due to systemic difficulties.
The low-counting mortality rate of mild cases can be over-calculated.
However, the reality is that death is the result of an infection in the past, which means that the current mortality rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authorities had observed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
The chances of immunity based on the behavior of other coronaviruses are very high, but in those cases, recovery from COVID-19 has been reported later after a positive test result of coronavirus.
These cases are feared to be due to further deterioration of the chronic infection than re-infection.
The virus is believed to have a natural and animal origin, through increased spillover infections.
The actual source of the infection is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, reported the first date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
The initial onset of symptoms was reported by official publications from the WHO on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are usually used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time cut since the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO specified the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths due to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lab, and the unconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lab specified a U07.2 code for deaths caused by medically or epidemiologically-infected COVID-19.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death toll stands at 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) which identifies the percentage of people who have died from the disease and the mortality rate (Infection Fatality Rate, IFR), which is the percentage of people who have died from the disease (infected and uninfected).
These figures do not have a fixed time frame and follow a specific population from infection to diagnosis.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Casigli<0xC3><0xB3>n de Adda, is a small village of 4,600 people, where 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In gangelat, the disease was spread through carnival festivals and spread to younger people, which causes relatively low mortality, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been officially classified.
In addition, the German health system has not been disrupted.
In the Netherlands, blood donors may have antibodies of about 3%, according to what has been evaluated.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The pandemic and its impact on mortality are different for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women ends in their 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8 percent among men and 1.7 percent among women.
The exact causes of these gender differences are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can cause them.
Gender-based immunological differences, the prevalence of smoking in women is relatively low and the development of co-morbidities in men younger than women, such as high blood pressure may have a role in higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
Since April 2020, the U.S. government has not been monitoring data related to the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral illnesses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease would be ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI is the virus, D is the disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or groups of people, in line with international recommendations to name for the prevention of Kalimalephan. The virus that caused COVID-19 is named as Saviar Actuary Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"The WHO uses the additional ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""the virus responsible for COVID-19"" in connection with the public."
"Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""."
"The virus and disease were commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""uhan coronavirus"" during the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China."
In the context of the use of the virus and disease location in January 2020, according to the 2015 guidelines, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as a temporary name for viruses and diseases.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the power constraints in the ideal supply chain, a few digital manufacturers are printing health care components such as the nasal swab and ventilator parts.
In one example, in an Italian hospital a ventilator valve is very urgent if the supplier is unable to deliver it within the required timeframe when a local new company tests the manufacturer's product construction and produces the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumors about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
It is believed that humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence to replicate the virus in pigs, poultry and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "mutual support test" to assess the effect of treatment of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest promise of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being developed.
First, the researchers are focused on creating a complete virus vaccine.
The goal of the use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, is to eliminate the immediate immune response of the human body to a new infection caused by COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-Spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, innovative strategy for vaccine development).
Testing of vaccines from either of these strategies for safety and efficacy is required. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The virus that causes this disease is contained in a genetic code vaccine that does not harm replicating it. An antibody-dependent increase has been hinted at as a potential challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but is controversial.
More than 300 active diagnostic trials have been underway since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating treatments already approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being done to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine phase III trials on remdesivir across different countries are due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 including Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta in lopinavir/ritonavir.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir in March 2020.
Significant improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir using experimental drugs.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, when the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a dose of one gram of the drug per day, it notes that double the dose can be extremely dangerous and life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical practitioners treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the context of COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicates that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further vivo studies after showing low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparing the primary spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through receptor interaction.
There are serious limitations to the study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin which has prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir in vitro does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The next stage of severe COVID-19 can be a cytokine disaster.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-inflammatory properties of cytokine. Tocilizumab has been included in the medical guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after completing a small study.
After seeing positive results in people with severe disease, it is undergoing phase 2 non-invasive testing at the national level in Italy.
Blood tests in combination with serum ferritin to identify cytokine disasters are meant to prevent the progression of the disease, which is thought to be the cause of death of some infected people.
In 2017 CAR T cell therapy was approved by the Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist FDA based on a past-related case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause.
To date, there is no conclusive, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The paid and frequent antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being investigated as a non-vaccinated method of inactivated vaccination given to those who need them.
This technique was tested for SARS with unintended consequences.
Viral inactivation is the expected mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of produced monoclonal antibodies, are on the way to development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the blood fluid portion taken from recovered patients, and the specific antibodies of this virus can be rapidly enlarged for organization.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
