At the international level, China is trying to make the yuan equal to the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
Given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing this deal in rupees and rubles.
NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Wednesday signed an agreement on the development of the S-400 missile defence system.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to sign the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal has been approved to pave the way for the US dollar to be paid for the deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing the deal in rupee and ruble in view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US.
The U.S. closed its borders during the Chinese
In September, Russia signed a S-400 missile deal with China.
Following the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
The ban made it almost impossible for China to buy a missile using the US dollar.
However, in recent years, China has tried to make its currency the international currency of the yuan against the dollar.
After this initiative, China has been continuously trying to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of the US dollar in international trade.
China wants to make the U.S. a global power.
The $5 billion mega defence deal could see the US impose a tax ban (countering American Adversaries through Sections of the CAATSA).
Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on China over the purchase of the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia have since begun to establish an alternative arrangement for the deal.
Earlier, due to US sanctions on the repair deal of INS Chakra, which was taken on lease from Russia, an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia was taken.
The Economic Analysts claim that in order to come out of such a situation, India should use the rupee-rupee exchange as an international currency to execute the deal.
So far, all the defence deals India has done with Russia have been done through dollars.
Why was the U.S. Constitution broken?
In August, President Donald Trump approved Russia's new anti-tank missile system, a law designed by the United States to prevent Russia from acting against the interests of the United States at the international level.

These include Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its interference in the 2016 US presidential election.

The high court is likely to pronounce its verdict on Thursday on the pleas of a large Muslim group seeking reconsideration of the Supreme Court's 1994 decision on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute.
The High Court had said in the judgment that namaz is not an integral part of Islam in the mosque.
A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer will pronounce the verdict.
He was released on bail on July 20.
Siddiqui, an originalist in the Ayodhya case, had objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M. Ismail Faruqui.
It is said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayers offered by the followers of Islam.
Siddiq has died and is being represented by his legal heir.
Muslim communities have argued before a Bench headed by the Chief Justice that the observation of the High Court in the said decision needs to be reconsidered by a five-member bench.
Because its Babri Masjid - Ram Mandir, the land dispute will have an impact.

The biggest drop in the rupee so far, the rupee has crossed 71 against the dollar
New Delhi: The rupee on Thursday hit a low of 71 against the US dollar, after falling 26 paise in early trade amid rising crude oil prices.
The rupee opened at Rs 70.95 against the dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange yesterday and then closed at Rs 71.
The rupee closed at 70.74 on Thursday.
Strong demand for US currency from oil importers at the end of the month, coupled with trade tensions between China and the US, strengthened the dollar against other major currencies in the world.
The rise in crude oil prices has also impacted the rupee due to rising inflation and exports of foreign institutional investors in the domestic share market.
At the beginning of the Asian trade, the standard Brent crude price reached $ 78 a barrel.
In his first visit to the island, he brought a message of peace to the world.
New Delhi: Prithvi Shaw has scored a century in his Test match debut.

Sachin Tendulkar was also happy to see this from the beginning of the earth shake.
The Prime Minister also praised the country.
The secretary recalled the day he first saw the earth shake and said something to her.
About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chauhan once asked me to see the batting of Prithvi Shaw.
"This young player wants to meet you and if you can meet him, it will be good," he said.
The doctor listened to his friend and went to check on him.
“He still remembers today that he told his friend that this child will one day play for India,” the secretary told him, “He told his friend that you are looking at a future Indian cricketer.”
My friend said, "Are you telling the truth?"
"You remember my words, this child will play for India.
The doctor told me about the world's largest oyster.
I'd like to say that I've seen the world through the lens of what I've learned so far.
It's a different game, but when you play it, it's more important.
If you want to be successful in international cricket, you need to learn fast.
In order to play for a long time in different grounds and conditions, it is necessary to have adaptability (the ability to play according to circumstances).
I think the Earth Shack has the ability to play sports in different conditions and this is the greatest strength of the Earth.
The minister said that the earth is the codification of the hands and eyes of the shaman.
The way he captures the line of the ball and the length, such is seen in very few players.

Did you read the title?
How can the court language of Ghazni's Sultan Mahmud Ghazni, who is a fan of the Somnath temple and a villain for the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, research by Delhi University historian Professor Shanta Pandey has revealed that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
When Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was only natural that Sanskrit was the language of the so-called high-ranking Brahmins.
Mumbai's Pandit Ghulam Dastgir Birjdar was remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Birajdar, who spoke in a simple Sanskrit that rickshaw pullers can understand, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before its publication.
The Holy Qur'an is the word of Sanskrit.
A <0x2B> RAN means the voice or message heard on the earth by the apostle.
Not only did he study in the Pathshala of Solapur, today he is considered one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country.
While living a simple life, Panditji does not seek to give lectures as a Sanskrit Pandit in the US or other countries to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is a pandita of Sanskrit.
There's a sense of self-worth there.
In order to learn Sanskrit from the United States, students have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
In India only most universities except Banaras Hindu University also have a Ph.D. dissertation of Sanskrit which is written in the language of that State itself.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati, but remember that education in Takshashila and Nalanda universities was taught only through Sanskrit medium.
The practice of Sanskrit in Afghanistan has been said by Prof. Shanta Pandey that not only was the language of the court of the Sultan of Ghazni a Sanskrit, but he has also noted that his money coins have also been inscribed in Sanskrit.
Pandey also noted that the coins were inscribed on the "Mahamud Sutran" in Sanskrit with the Qur'an's imports and that Panini, the grammarian of Sanskrit, was a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru has stated in a huge chapter in "My Hindu Darshan" that the power and sustainable power of the Sanskrit language stemmed from the Pashtun language of Afghanistan and the Pashtuns of the Pathans.
It is now accepted that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages are derived from Sanskrit.
It is further surprising that the main architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and some other members of the Constituent Assembly, Muslims and South Indians, proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
During the debate on the National Language of English against Hindi in the Constituent Assembly on 13 September 1949, Deputy Foreign Ministers Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed the National Language of Sanskrit.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the "National Herald" on September 11, 1949, gives an estimate of the brutality of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, even today, we have not been able to define a national language.
There are 22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit and Urdu, in our Constitution as official languages, but there is no national language.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his treatise, he goes on to describe the importance that Sanskrit has had to the world: "In the year 1874, Sir William Jones said, "God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its composition is amazing."
It is fuller than the Greek language, richer than the Latin, and more educated than both of them.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since it has become a folk language."
At present, the Sanskrit language has been the only language to be administered by members like Union Minister Smriti Irani as a prayer or MP.
We need to preserve the year of Sanskrit and make it a living and a people's language.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It would be a shame if they made a serious effort instead of showing it as a public language or a symbolic effort to make it public.
After arriving at the airport, Narendra Modi asked him to come with him.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was received at the Ahmedabad airport.
At that time, leaders of the party, including the chief minister, were present.
