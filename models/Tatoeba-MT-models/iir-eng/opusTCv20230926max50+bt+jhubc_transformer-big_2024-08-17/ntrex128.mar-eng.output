Welsh I don't worry about 'looking like a Muppet'
Some AMs are skeptical about the suggestion of changing their title to MWP (Welsh Parliament).
The decision to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament has raised suspicions.
I am worried that the political parties will not be able to change this.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the title "looks like Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp means feces.
One of the players said that the whole group is "disgusting" and suggested options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "free-minded" about the name change, but noted that the MWP to Muppet was a short verbal harassment.
In this context, the Welsh original is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what to name the members of the Assembly will, of course, depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Assembly has been given the right to change its name through the Welsh Government Act 2017.
In June, the Commission published the findings of public consultation on these proposals, which found the Assembly to have broad support for naming a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of AM, the Commission did not favour Welsh Parliament member or WMP, but, the MWP option received the highest support in public consultation.
AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the law on changes within a few weeks.
This Act on Amendments will include other changes in the working pattern of the Assembly, including the rules on disqualification of AMs and the structure of the Committee system.
When we discuss this law, we will take the final vote on the question of what name to address them.
Macedonians vote for a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum is aimed at resolving decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece, a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name is representative of its territory, and that the EU and NATO members have consistently objected to its attempt to give it.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, has been a vocal opponent of the name change.
But, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, supporters of the referendum claim that the name change is the only cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced during a church clash in Harlem
"Historically, the older people I spoke to seemed to have a bar and a discussion on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is none of that."
He said it's impossible to see the bars.
“People come together in different ways,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly."
In the case of churches, they worry that the money coming from property sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He further said that in place of churches, apartment buildings can come in, in which there would be a shortage of condominiums filled with people who did not help the neighbouring shelters.
"The majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so the time for these churches to close completely will come soon because the majority of people who live in these condominiums are unlikely to be members of these churches."
After a decade of St. Martin's, both churches were built by groups of white people before the metropolitan community - Harlem - became a black metropolis in 1870.
The original Gore Methodist group left in the 1930s.
The building was owned by a group of black people who were praying nearby.
A group of blacks led by Rev. John Howard took over St. Martin, who had led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, was the main route to shopping in Harlem, and had opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire that broke out in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, starting Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the hour of the poor."
In July, the experts who played the Carillon referred to him in other ways: "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
This expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world to be litigated by a black, Dionysos A. Lind, who made his debut in a much larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryvender submits that St. Martini has not transferred him.
What has happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complicated tale of architects and contractors, brought to some extent by church leaders, and the rest by episcopal dioceses.
The Vestry – the board of directors of Paris, composed of general leaders – expressed concern in July when writing the Diocese that the Diocese would attempt to hand over the “cost matter” to the Vestry, although Vestry was not involved in the assignment of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the Diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured in a lobster drive in California.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while shooting for a lobster on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. near the Bikinis beach in Ansinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he heard a boy screaming for help when he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning and along with a group of people he went to him and helped him get out of the water.
Hamlin said that at first he thought it was a joke to catch a lobster, but then he said, "I found out that he was screaming, he took my tea!"
I've got my tea!"
"He's got all the blood on his hands," Hermione said as she pulled away from the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hamlin said.
The boy was airlifted to the Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The shark species responsible for the attack was not identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was determined not to be a dangerous species.
The boy sustained serious injuries on the upper part of his body, police said.
Authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Panto Beach in Casablade to Swamij in Asinitas for inspection and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Censorship plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
The Sensbury Department is pitting Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams through the appointment of Store-Physical Beauty Eyelash Specialist Assistants.
As part of the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn massive penetration into the cosmetics market, as fashion and homeware sales continue to decline, more large beauty oils will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
One of the ways to use the shelf space once used by TVs, microwaves, and homewares is by looking for supermarkets.
Sensbury said its number of cosmetics will be doubled to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twizarman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in branded areas found in stores such as Boots.
This supermarket is also resuming its boutique makeup range so that most of the products are vegetarian friendly – there is an increased demand from young buyers.
Additionally, Perfume Retailer Fragrance Shop will see discounts in two sensory stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second later this year, in Sale Oak, Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and buying a small amount of food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do a lot to attract people to you.
Sensbury's Chief Executive, Mike Koop, said that these sales centers will look more like department stores, while supermarkets are trying to cope with more services and non-food items against chain Aldi and Lidl discounters.
Sensbury is setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and they have also launched several habitats since they purchased both these chains two years ago, which according to them have been successful in increasing the sale of groceries.
The previous attempt to reshape our beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sensbury tested a joint venture with Boots in 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split income from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
The new policy comes after Censbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owners of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the scheme by incorporating a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posey and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Censorship's, Commercial Director, says: "We've changed the look of our beauty oils to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be willing to give advice.
Our range of brands is made to suit every need, and because of the attractive atmosphere and convenient locations, we are the most attractive beauty destinations that challenge the old buying method."
Peter Jones 'disgusted' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby 'hurts' Dragons Den star Peter Jones after he cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for your homewares and accessories brand Truey.
This business is compared to Paltrow's secret brand in Guyana.
This morning, the 37-year-old president announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby stepped out of her profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute, insinuating Dragons Den star Peter Jones – and has focused on her new grand contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "shocked" when the popular girl on TV admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no more time to focus on her homeware and accessories brand True.
The business is compared to Paltro's secret brand in Guayaquil and is estimated to double Bilobi's wealth to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Soon after Willoughby, 37, announced that he was actually leaving Instagram, Jones got out of the UK by jet and headed for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Holi was really at the top of the priority list.
It would have been her long - term future which would have made her successful for the next two or three decades.
Everyone was surprised by her decision to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday.
There is a warehouse full of items in Marlowe headquarters that is ready to sell."
Experts say Britain's exit from one of Britain's most trusted stars, the company's massive investment in a variety of products, from cushions to blankets and from clothing to homeware, could cost millions of dollars, and its start-up is likely to be delayed even further.
This could be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, a mother of three, have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past ten years.
Truey was founded in 2016 along with Willoughby Cap and Jones and joined 52-year-old Jones as president in March.
The couple spend the holidays together and Jones owns 40 per cent of Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McParty as host of I am a celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not be talking about these business developments."
"We fell in love and we fell in love"
Some have criticized the media for expressing an "unbelievable" opinion and being so positive about North Korea's president.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
Mr. Trump described his style as "News Anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is looking forward to a second meeting after Trump praised his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearization of the North Korean Peninsula.
The disarmament negotiations have come to a halt.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the move to disarm North Korea early did not seem to receive a "consequential response" from the United States.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to keep the pressure on it.
In his speech, Trump expressed a more optimistic view.
"Our relations with North Korea are very good," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we've made this wonderful discovery."
Our efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – rocket tests have stopped, aiding the evacuation of Olis, and the rest of the US staff returning home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space, it's better to have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing a little finger at the crowd that was standing in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told not to need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been moved elsewhere, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, he made it very clear that we are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenge," Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to move to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work in the actual location.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are studying the situation in Palu to see if foreign institutions can be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
In the wake of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country is very less prepared to deal with the impact of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not easily found on other beaches.
Although a warning was given earlier, a tsunami warning in Palu is likely to have caused the loss of lives, as there was no siren.
It is difficult to travel to many islands in Indonesia during the best times.
Natural disasters make it more difficult to help.
A hospital ship set up to treat earthquake victims in Lombok is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of a new crisis.
President Joko Widodo put the issue of improving Indonesia's infrastructure at the center of his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government's failure to meet its obligations is a challenge for the next year's elections.
There is also the pressure of prolonged ethnic tensions in Indonesia before Mr. Joko, in which Muslim majority members have chosen a more narrow faith path.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands displaced by Christian and Muslim mobs using axes, arrows, and bows, and other village weapons, fighting in the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturgis equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturgis saved Liverpool from the Premier League defeat by scoring a point in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
He got a pass from Sherdan Shakiri, about 30 yards out of Chelsea's goal, while Strij's team was trailing 1-0.
He tapped the ball on his left side and then picked up a shot to the far post.
His effort went to the top of the box and fell to the top corner on the right side of the net.
In the end, the ball went through Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, get on the ball and when players like Shaw always play forwards as much as possible, I tried to take as much time as possible for myself," Sturgis told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming in and touching once and didn't think much about it and just shot a shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after getting a point from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
At that time, the Blues striker again sent a pass to Matteo Kovacic, then took the lead near the midfield and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go on the midfield.
He took a deep breath, then went into the box.
Hazard broke the defence and saw Allison Baker of Liverpool end his game by throwing a shot in a distant post on the left leg.
Liverpool will take on Stadeo San Paolo in the Champions League group stage match on Wednesday at 3 pm in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will take on UEFA Europa League side in London on Thursday at 3pm.
The death toll in Indonesia's Tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the disaster agency said on Sunday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday was reported to have left several people trapped in the rubble of buildings and caused waves of up to 20 feet in height, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
More than 380,000 people live in the city of Palu, where the buildings that fell there are now piles of rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man after the death of a woman.
An investigation into the murder has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Bergenhead, Merseyside.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 44-year-old woman who was found dead at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street with an ankle injury.
Police have urged people to come forward if they see or hear anything in the area.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I am appealing to anyone in the area of John Street in Bergenhead to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have had anything to do with Dashcam Foot, to contact us as they may have the necessary information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Bergenhead and her body was found inside a building.
A friend of mine called me this morning and asked me where I was going.
The investigation is ongoing and we are in contact with the families of the deceased.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was trying to enter his flat, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he realized what had happened.
Residents were told they would be allowed back into the building in a few hours.
A police officer said the entire area has been designated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene and was crying.
She said, "It's very bad."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and the other van was on the outside.
A number of officers were standing inside the cordon and monitoring the block of flats.
If anyone has any information, they should give it to DM<0x40>MerPollCC or call 101 or contact Crimestoppers by mentioning the 30 September log 247 on 0800 555 111.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is a fresh monument to the controversy of rewriting history
If it is removed, it will be a poetic justice, as the purist followers of its raging head have carried out the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artefacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The ongoing dispute over the removal of the puppets indicated that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be a victim.
The English Civil War was not fought by Cromwell, nor was it fought by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong chromewall will be sacrificed for the actions of their ancestors of the previous century.
The magnificent description of Cromwell by Sir William Hammo Thornycroft is evidence of the 19th century's view and is part of the historical account of the personality that many still believe to be venerable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "According to many, perhaps more so than today, in the late 19th century, in the opinion of many, Cromwell was, in his case, a supporter of Parliament than of external pressure, of course, of royalty.
Whether this description is absolutely accurate has consistently been the subject matter of historical debate.
One thing is for sure, the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the later development of our country, and Cromwell is a personally identifiable figure who represents one side of the valley.
His performance as Lord Protector is also festive and memorable."
The Great Wall of China was built by Chinese farmers
Local media reported that a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in China's southwest.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man's name was "Yuan," and he was found dead in a broken blood vessel, lying in a pool of blood at Lippenshui market in Guizhou province.
A farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a hogri in China's Qinghai province on May 30, 2005.
It is said that he had come with his cousin to sell 15 dolls in this market from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and he found the door of a nearby pig's cage open.
He said there was a large blood clot in his throat.
The forensic examination confirmed that the farmer had been killed by strangulation weighing 550 pounds.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and confused," said another brother, who was nicknamed "Woo," quoted by Guiyang Ewing News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
He didn't have the right to kill Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Ewing News that he had been locked in to prevent the pig from attacking anyone, and that police were collecting evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this incident is rare, instances of pigs attacking humans have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig ran over a Welsh farmer on his tractor, and his wife finally drove him away.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the ducks were not usually aggressive but that the taste of the blood could "encourage" them.
"They're just playing games.
They're very, very intelligent, and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them," he said.
The impact of the storm will cause heavy rain in the United States.
According to the forecast, as the Rossa storm moves to more cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico, its intensity is decreasing.
However, in the coming days, there will be heavy rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, the wind speed of the Rossa was 85 mph, i.e. it is a Category 1 storm and it is at 385 kilometers southwest of Punta Uganda.
It is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gust of wind is forming over the Pacific Ocean and it is heading east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa Baja moves towards the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push the temperate humidity deep into the northwards of the southwest United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Later, a combination of temperate humidity with the incoming waves will create widespread rainfall over the southwest region in the coming days.
Locally 1 to 4 inches of rain is likely to result in dangerous floods, landslides and possibly landslides in the desert.
Due to the temperate humidity over the deep, the rainfall intensity will remain 2 to 3 inches per hour at some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Most parts of Arizona, especially in the southwest, are expected to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the disturbed nature of the temperate rain, it is possible to get a sudden flood with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is very dangerous to go out in the foot desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the canyons to become rivers that run dry and there will be strong winds and dust looms at the local level.
Heavy rain is expected in parts of southern California.
It is possible to get more than half an inch of rain, so that there will be light amounts of debris and roads will be slippery.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
Rainfall is expected to continue into the early morning hours on Sunday and Monday, followed by heavy showers on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected on Tuesday and will continue into Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder, there will be some intense fluctuations in temperature in October, but the temperate part will be very hot.
This causes a dramatic change in temperature in a short period of time.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in Central America.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the temperature will rise again.
A hot start is expected in early October with a widespread 80 degree rise from the southernmost plateau to the northeastern parts of the United States in much of the central and eastern United States.
The temperature in New York City is expected to rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the normal average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, temperatures are likely to be higher than average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's
The emotional testimony given by Supreme Court-appointed Brad Keven and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on Thursday, saw more than 20 million people, six television networks.
Meanwhile, while maintaining a political stalemate, broadcasters broke regular schedules on Friday at the last minute by giving up: an agreement brokered by Arizona Sen: FBI's Jeff Flake will run the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kevin was caught drunk at a high school party and tried to take off his clothes.
Kevin, in a very emotional testimony, said that we are 100 percent sure that nothing of this sort has happened.
On Friday, Nelson reported that more than 20.4 million people had seen the testimony.
The company is counting the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which showed the event, could not be immediately available.
And Nelson usually has some difficulty in counting the number of people who see the office.
In this sense, it is the same number as the audience for a playoff football match or academy award.
"Fox News Channel, which has been a strong supporter of Kevin's appointment, took the lead over all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing," Nelson said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, the curiosity reached its peak.
Flake was the centre of attraction on Friday.
After the Central Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote in favor of Kevin, he was interrupted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters chanted slogans against him as he was on his way to the Judiciary Committee's hearing.
He stood there for a few minutes, watching the broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," she said.
Do you think they are telling the truth?
She said, "You have so much power.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator was shut down, he said there was more to be said at the committee's hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was to vote to send Kevenow’s nomination to the entire Senate for a vote, cable and broadcast networks carried out all the launches several hours later.
But Flake said he would only do so based on the assumption that the FBI would investigate the allegations made against the appointee next week, for which the minority Democrats are urging.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his Mics, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with the Queen and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Flake's election had the power, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve him without an investigation.
The FBI has launched an investigation into President Trump's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politics" from Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of "politicizing" Britain's future on its plans to leave the European Union and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham, UK on September 20, 2018.
In one of his other interviews on the newspaper's homepage, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked more of his alleged checkers plan for Brexit, a proposal by Britain and the EU to compile each other's taxes is "totally unbelievable."
Wedy Sims shooting: Police arrest dietitian Samson, suspected in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old Weddy Sims, a basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Police said a video of the clash between Sims and Sims was released by the officials and that the spectacles of Sims were missing.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police seized the glasses from the scene and said they had the DNA of Simson.
After questioning, the police said that he had confessed to killing Vedi.
Prosecutors said his bond amounted to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying he died of gunshot wounds to the head.
The department has credited the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and residents of the area for assisting in the investigation and arresting the suspect.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alewa thanked regional legislative bodies for their "persuasion of openness and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot 6-inch-tall forward grew up in Betten Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 last season and took 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" by Weddy's death and "shocked."
"It's always a concern," said Wade.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash from the Pok<0xC3><0xA9>petal volcano has reached the southernmost part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it moved rapidly, releasing 183 lots of gas and ash within 24 hours.
A number of businesses and businesses were under surveillance.
Pictures showing the windows of the ash-laden car were on social media in nearby cities such as Mexico City's Shochimilco.
Geological experts found an increase in activity in the area of the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano named "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
A clash broke out between the police and Catalan separatists ahead of the Independence Day celebrations.
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona, and thousands of people joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote over secession.
When the riot police intercepted a group of masked division-supporters, they threw eggs and coloured brooms, resulting in dust clouds on the streets filled with airwaves by airwaves tourists.
Later in the day, the police used batons to bring the situation under control.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" and the unificationists chanted "Let Spain be Violet."
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries in the encounter.
After the October 1 referendum held by Madrid as illegal but divisive Catalans, there was a year-long period of paralysis in the region of independent thought.
A large number of voters opted for independence, but the number of voters remained low as those who opposed the partition boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations amid violent clashes across the region.
A group of pro-independence groups had been camping all night on Friday to avoid a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued but he was forced to take a different path.
Narcissus Termis, 68, was involved in a separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
Last year we had a very good life.
I saw tears of joy in the eyes of my parents while voting, but we are stuck," he said.
Despite a minor yet significant victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, and many of their popular leaders have either embraced anonymity on their own or have been detained awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and then declaring independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, who spoke on the phone in support of the police, said politicians from both sides have supported the fight.
“The situation is getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed since the end of last year, Oriol Jankeras, announced that he would contest the European parliamentary elections next year.
"The best way to stand as a candidate for the European elections is to protest the decline in democratic values and the Spanish government's scepticism," he said.
London: Man arrested after car rams into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly ramming a car into a house in London Derry.
The incident took place at around 10.30 am.
Inspector Bob Blemings, of the department, said the gates and buildings were also damaged.
A crossbow is also likely to be thrown on the car at one point.
Meng's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Steven Gerrard as manager of the Ibrox club surprised the Rangers by being promoted by Livingston to hand over his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack led to Pard and Gary Holt's team equalized with Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team missed out on the Premiership this season without a win and next Sunday, they will face the eight-point trailing Hearts.
On Thursday, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, will continue his invincible six-match run in the division, his coach Holt has not seen a defeat since he picked up formulas from Kenney Mylar last month.
Livingston takes a chance against Boothe's guest team
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before the points could have been scored, as their exact score put the Rangers in complete danger.
Scott Robinson broke the circle but crawled in front of the goal, only to widen his effort after Alan Lithgow pushed Craig Holt's head into the goal.
The hosts knew that they could put the visitors in trouble, so they were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how it became a big hit.
The Rangers gave a free-kick and Livingston got a free kick. The Declan Garage and Robinson paired with Menga, he grabbed the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Until then, the Rangers had maintained their dominance, but the defensive line of the opposition was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not suffer much.
The same pattern would remain in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos had to defend himself from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs conceded Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball further away from Livingston.
Crosses in Livingston's box continued to come in and they were removed continuously, with two penalty claims – a challenge from Halket to substitute player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball – abandoned.
"Anonymous" from Livingston
BBC Scotland's Alasdair LeMont Tony McCormick at Arena
A great game and result for Livingston.
He played very well and did more than he expected.
His style of play and the players have rarely changed since he returned from the top position, but he should be given a lot of credit for the way he shaped the team after Holt's arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halket played from the heart, he led an excellent defensive line, while Mengan continued to haunt Conor Goldson and Joe Voral.
However, the motivation of the Rangers has diminished.
As much as they were led by Gerard, they fell short of their standard game.
His final game was lacking – only once did he beat the local team – a sort of warning for the middle-order rangers in the taluk.
A warm welcome to the city of Cologne
On Saturday, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for a luncheon.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial German tour – aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
He also spoke on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's inclusion in the EU.
Later, he went to Cologne to inaugurate a grand new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons in front of the mosque to avoid crowding 25,000 people, but many supporters gathered nearby to watch their president.
Hundreds of protesters – many of them Kurds – also voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome his country.
The divisor images of these guests, which were considered heroes by some German Turks and derided by others as dictators, were only reflected in these double demonstrations.
Depford road accident: Biker killed in collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed when he was hit by a car.
The accident, a busy street in Deptford, near the confluence of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the southeast of the city, occurred at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics helped, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This is the second accident in a row on Children's Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday, months after a cyclist was killed in a collision.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the deceased and inform his family members.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed and motorists have been advised to avoid that part.
Long-Lauren Jail: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials were injured after a riot broke out in a highly secure male prison, the prison office said.
On Sunday at 09:30 BST, the riot in the HMP Long Martian began and it continues.
An expert "Tornado" officer has been called to deal with the riot, eight prisoners are involved in the riot and it is limited to one wing.
The officers sustained minor injuries on their faces and were undergoing treatment.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the incident in HMP Long Larten.
Six people were injured in the incident.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and responsible persons will be sent to the police and they will have to spend more time in jail."
HMP Long Laurentin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous in the country.
The prison governor had to be hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner in June.
In October last year, riot officials were called in to handle the severe riots in which the personnel were attacked by pull balls.
A sudden flood threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City due to Rosa Cyclone (Possible for drought areas)
It is rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low-pressure strip, but the same is likely to happen next week as the Rossa cyclone is heading south into the desert with the rest of its power, so there is a risk of a sudden flood.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected to move directly towards Ross Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain arriving late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only 10 tropical cyclones in the 200 miles area of Phoenix have maintained their status or low pressure since 1950!"
The storm Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
According to the latest forecast of the National Centre for Cyclonic Storms (NCT), rainfall will be 2 to 4 inches, up to 6 inches in the Mogolon rim of Arizona.
Rainfall of up to 1 to 2 inches is likely to occur in other parts of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, while up to 4 inches is likely at isolated places.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the rain caused by the rosacea will be beneficial as the region is hit by a drought.
Although flooding is a concern, a little rain can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently facing a drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drott Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a low-intensity drought, which is the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of the Rosa cyclone will cross the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The wind speed was 85 miles per seven on Sunday, hitting 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing more cold water in the Pacific, thus reducing its power.
Thus, it is expected to reach Mexico in the form of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
There is a significant risk of flooding due to heavy rainfall over parts of Mexico.
"It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which can fall up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
It will then move as a tropical storm to the north of Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the form of a tropical low-pressure belt early Tuesday morning, which will then pass through Arizona and enter the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main crisis caused by the impact of the storm or its balance sheet is the possibility of very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are likely to cause landslides and landslides in the hilly areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested on murder charges
Three minors and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of trying to kill a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The minor boy was found to be in injured condition at about 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition was stated to be stable.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night from the Radstock area, Somerset police said.
He appealed to the people to take action if they have any mobile footage of the incident.
Trump said he was "selfish, angry" with the Democratic Party.
"For Judge Kevenow, one vote is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and provocative behavior," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Kavanaugh had been "selfish, angry" with the Democratic Party in his entire nomination process.
In his statement to Congress on Thursday, he strongly and passionately denied the allegations of sexual assault on Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
Ford also confirmed the allegations at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that that day "the American people saw the genius and quality and courage of Kevin."
"The opinion that confirms Judge Kevenow is the opinion of one of the most successful legal experts of our time, a judge with a brilliant career in public service," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president spoke of the importance of the Republican vote in midterm elections.
It's been five weeks since one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not standing up, but I'm standing up," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting against all the big candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that Democrats were on a mission to "resist and disrupt."
A senior GOP leadership colleague told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kevin's candidacy is expected by Friday.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami kill hundreds, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and several others were swept away after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday for a celebration when waves of six metres (18 feet) high hit the beach, killing several people and destroying everything on the way.
The earthquake was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When there was a threat of a tsunami yesterday, people were doing their own work on the coast and they did not leave immediately and they died," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, otters, houses, houses, everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) from the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees and readied to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 1,6700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air images released by the disaster relief agency showed a number of buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The city was also hit by an earthquake on Saturday.
The earthquake affected 2.4 million people in the region.
Indonesia's Assessment and Technology Application Institute (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times the strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It said the size of the tsunami must have increased due to the geography of the city, which is located on the edge of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings have been found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher in the area called Donggala, 300 kilometres north of Palu, and that the area was close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"There was no information from Donggal that the communication was "completely disrupted," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people were living here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s already a crisis, but the situation can get worse,” it said.
Officials said that the warning was issued within that time period, but there was widespread stigma on the institute on Saturday for not informing that Palula was hit by the tsunami.
A video posted on social media showed a man standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the beach, and buildings and cars were washed away.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
Due to the earthquake and tsunami, a large number of power supply was cut off and communication was disrupted around the area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, but rescuers are in dire need of food and other basic supplies, officials said.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the rescue center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 800.
This is very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that the World Vision staff arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees had set up tent shelters in the premises of their offices, and they saw scenes of destruction on the way.
"I've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
While relief groups have started preparing for disaster relief, some have complained that foreign aiders with deep experience are being prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesia's rules, only foreign funds, supplies and staff can go there if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasnt happened yet.
"The disaster is at the provincial level," said Aalia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government said, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' then we will open up to international aid, but this is not the case yet."
When the second night came in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who went missing still hope to find their loved ones through a miracle as such stories are found in natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandano, who trained the two paragliders for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month, is missing.
The other students who were stuck in the Roa Roa hotel were our students, Mandgi said.
As a senior in the paragliding sector, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. said that within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel falling into the paragliding community, he had sent WhatsApp messages to the participants of the Beach Festival in a hurry.
However, their messages, instead of two blue markings, remained only a pale mark.
"I don't think that's the message," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from ATMs in Newport, Lviv
According to a Newport Police Department report, thieves stole $26,750 from a brick worker on Friday morning while paying at an ATM in Newport, Levy.
Detective Denis McCarty said in a statement that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money.
While he was busy, another man "runs after the brick employee" and ran away with a bag of money for delivery.
The witness has stated in the leaflet that he saw several suspects running away from the spot, but the police did not disclose the exact number of persons involved in the incident.
If anyone has any information about their identity, call the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kenney West: Rapper Has Changed His Name
Rapper Kenny West has changed his name.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "It was officially called Kenny West."
The 41-year-old West, for a while, was nicknamed the Moniquer for his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes ahead of his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Albany.
Singer Ariana Grande is coming to the show, which the producer said was leaving for "emotional reasons."
As a short form of his current business name, West previously said that the term was of religious importance to him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said while discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy earlier this year.
You are me, I am you, we are you.
This change came from Kenya, that is, the one and only, that is, our good, our bad, our confusion and everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
This is one of the popular rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he likes the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West coordinator, J-Z, has also made such a change with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use force against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians in the wake of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador said on Saturday that he would "never use the military to behead Mexicans."
On October 2, 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters, killing about 300 people, during which time the left-leaning student movement had roots throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly subsidies and to open more free public universities.
He said that youth are turning to criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
U.S. to double supply of A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) funds
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and AI entrepreneur Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The US does not have a formal AI policy, at the same time, the US government's various departments have announced AI.
China launched its plan last year, aiming to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The double AI research budget will be a good start, as all other countries lag far behind the United States, and we look forward to the next revolution in AI," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding will double the chance for the next major success in AI in the US.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by the Houston Mifflin Harcourt this month and is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, a company that has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of the leading AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest-ranked American Athletics Player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee referred to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, so that it would help in the search for the next futurists.
U.S. researchers have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"China is not taking away academic experts, it is taking corporates," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired eminent personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy would also help the US strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think that green cards should be automatically issued for PhDs in AI.
China's State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of the United States and other government agencies provide funding to researchers in the same way that China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, but the quality of educational work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, where industry and academia will form partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a selection committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
In the case of NSFs, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in AI research.
A US law aimed at creating a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not been approved for several months.
Macedonians voted unanimously to change their country's name.
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would settle their decades-long dispute with Greece, as Greece banned its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to its territory and has exercised a denial of entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts that at least 50 percent of the electorate would be needed to validate the vote.
The question on the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership by agreeing to a deal with Greece?"
Along with Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, supporters of the name change claim that this is a price for Macedonia to pursue admissions to institutions such as the EU and NATO, a country that has emerged since the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under one umbrella of the European Union, because that means a more secure life for all of us," said Oliveira Giorgiveska, 79.
Though not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that we will abide by the result of this opinion to be conclusive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The National Election Commission stated that there was no irregularity till 1 pm.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I'm out to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje, the capital.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote on September 30, 2018 in Sremika, Macedonia in a referendum on changing the country’s name. This change will open the door for NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, in front of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old homemaker, is building a small platform in front of tents set up for mass boycotters and putting chairs.
We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but, we want to participate with firm conviction, not with the back door," said Kavardarkov.
Our country is poor, but we are self-sufficient.
If they don't want us to accept Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia coordination."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment into Macedonia, as it has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the majority will support the people because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO," he said after the vote.
He said that if the result is "yes," it will be "a confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research said 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum — a percentage lower than the required proportion.
In another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of people were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful in this election, a vote of no more than 50 per cent is required.
If this referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the West-led government that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton's defence line for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Stirling opened the batting line-up at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday to give Manchester City a 2-0 win.
The goal in the 65th minute was very easy.
This Argentine striker and got a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the order.
He ran out of Bryant's three defenders before being knocked out on the open field.
He was followed by four green shirts.
He pushed the ball around a defender, then pushed the ball to the side of the Bryant box.
Then he turned to the left, and there was a snarl.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, beating Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan on the right side of the net using a right boot.
There are some problems with the foundation of Aguero," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We're going to play 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky to have him at that time."
But Sky Blues took the early lead in the first leg of the sterling Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At the same time, Aguero got the ball inside the Brighton area.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen on the left side in a beautiful manner.
Sen took a few touches and then gave a lead towards the sterling distant post.
This Sky Blues forward tapped into the ball net shortly before going out of bounds.
In Germany, City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neker-Erina.
Sheridan wants to play for the Reds.
Since the Nationals have been knocked out of the series, there was not much reason to start another forced start.
But always ready for the competition, she is expected to face the challenge on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but there will still be a benefit if she plays a chain match for the Rockies who have taken a game-leading lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockyjani secured a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but he is still waiting to fight for his first division book.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver will be crowded, we're going to be able to at least get behind the rubber and play another team at a high level that I haven't played at any point this year."
Why don't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they may be reportedly inclined to let Sherzer in on such an occasion.
"Sherzer, who is going to start his 34th season, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will keep an eye on his usual finals on Sunday.
This Washington Right-hander is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA this season and has 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republicans' presence in midterm elections, the President referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, elected by the Supreme Court.
What we're doing in November is going to be hard.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
It’s one of the biggest, biggest – I’m not fighting but I’m really fighting that’s why I’m going all over the place for big candidates.
Trump said, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see all this is happening now.
And they are determined to regain power in any necessary way, you see, this selfishness, this loyalty.
They don't care who we hurt, they don't care who we beat to get power and control, so they want power and control, we don't give it to them."
He said Democrats are on a mission to "resist and block."
And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "cruel and selfish and ruthless and hypocritical."
He was referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee's rating of Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, which was widely criticised by the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you open the document.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, I wait for one – it was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The church is no longer a big church.
He doesn't listen to what they say
It wasn't a surprise that my parents voted for me.
Finally, I am the latest in the Labour MP’s queue to be told that you are not welcome – just for speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she had taken a firm stand against hatred against Jews.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn in the convicting resolution.
On the importance of national security, a responsible economic policy on Europe, unfortunately these are the same issues on which Jeremy had differences with previous leaders.
At a meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, he said, "We want to be inclusive and productive at meetings."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night’s GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, there is no such atmosphere and the phrase "more kind, decent," politics has only ever been forgotten if, in fact, it begins.
It is increasingly clear that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is being weighed on the basis of whether the party would be acceptable to the leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy Lider became president, because I had previously expressed a similar political opinion, and my colleagues were beginning to expect me to take a stand that I would never have accepted otherwise – be it national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly and what I say is not really important, I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party, that there is a wave of defamation on social media, that I should be removed from the election, that I should not be in the Centres politics, that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the reactions to me are political in nature.
I am amazed at the professional and determined nature of such friends, who do not hesitate to face the rain of sexual or racial abuse on a daily basis.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so liberal as to shrink the party with every "no confidence" proposal or change of the rules of choice.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years as my "everything will be fine" followed by a request to keep my head down and not to say more.
I didn't do that in politics.
Annoyed by the negligence of the Thatcher government, the overall class of my school literally fell down and since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, as a local corporator or as a government minister, I have been demanding better public services for those in dire need.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can be confused in any way with the position of my policies and the area of disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would like to say that the Brexit that the country is moving towards will have an adverse impact on families, businesses and our social services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the fact is that I have a message for the people of my constituency, not for the movement of Nottingham, that I am proud to serve you, whether you are a member of the Labour Party or not, and I promise you that no threat or political justification of my resignation can deter me from my work, which, in my opinion, is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Iron 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Iron Reaches Top
The two late tries may have had some adverse effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ire deserved the day-to-day victory in the amazing-entertaining Tenants Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, his defense was fine, just like the excellent skill of taking chances, which gave the local team and coach Peter Marchi the absolute right to be happy.
"We've had so many tests for our game and we're still undefeated, so I'm happy," he said.
Robin Christian of Melrose said: "The credit for this goes to Irona, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
A 14th-minute try from Grant Anderson, substituted by Frazier Klimod, gave the Irish a lead, but a yellow card released by the Warriors for the Scottish cape Rory Hughes earned Melrose points, and Jason Baggett pulled out a random try.
Klimo led the Irish with a penalty half-time first, then he led Ireland 17-5 in a single trial at the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trivia bag made a comeback, reducing the five-point gap.
After that, the game was stopped for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the stretcher and from the restart went further with the reflection of Air Stafford McDowell's Triala Clemo.
Iron's seasonal captain, Blair McPherson, was later given a yellow card, and again, Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unchanged Bruce Colvin's trivia at the end of a very tense left.
Later, the local team made a comeback, but, and as the penalty line-out knocked Clemmons off the ball, Strauss-Hutchinson was given a yellow card and McPherson was knocked out of the game.
After David Armstrong's box-kick was caught by Kyle Rowe and sent away for the fifth try of the local team to Flanker Gregor Henry, Klimoe replaced him as he did at the time of the restart.
Steel game star is trying his career in the hotel industry.
After learning that steel game star Ford Kirnan has been appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company, he took steps to turn to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with long-time humor partner Greg Hemfill.
The couple has announced that the ninth series coming up in this running show will be final, and Kirron is planning his life after work in Craigslist.
According to the official record listing, he is the Director of ArdriftMorne Limited.
A Scottish Sun source has hinted that Kiernan will join Glasgow's "stealing restaurant business," but the actor declined to comment on the issue.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s hope for a landlocked Bolivia to open the way for the Court Pacific.
Khalashi La is patrolling the rigging-clad naval headquarters in Paz.
Flags of the sky are hoisted on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the bottom of the Navy to the Amazon, the following motto appears: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it."
The memories of the beaches lost in the bloody conflict with Chile from 19th-century resources throughout the land-covered Bolivia are still alive - as if sailing in the Pacific Ocean is yet to come.
Those hopes are perhaps the highest in this decade, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, has a spirit of unity and courage, and is, of course, looking forward to a positive outcome from the outcome," said Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Cazadila.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's verdict on a large screen across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will adjudicate Bolivia's claim — after decades of ups and downs — Chile has accepted the responsibility of negotiating to give Bolivia an autonomous route to the sea.
Bolivia’s attractive personality local President Evo Morales – who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year – also relies heavily on Monday’s verdict.
At the end of August, he promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
But according to some analysts, the court is unlikely to deliver a verdict in favour of Bolivia – and even if that happens, the situation will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to give Chile's territory, and has concluded that it will not determine the outcome of potential talks.
The final debate took place just six months after the ICJ was elected, indicating that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law.
And to move forward for the sake of Bolivia, the last four years may have pushed it back.
"The case of obtaining a sea route has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zarate.
Morales' offensive rhetoric has ended Chile's reputation as a left-wing country, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will start talking, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivian representative at The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welze, has rejected the view that the court decision-making process is abnormally dynamic.
"Tomorrow will be a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to usher in a new era of relations with Chile," he said, adding that it will be an opportunity to complete 139 years of disagreement with each other's interests.
Morales is still the most popular leader of Latin America, even being rejected by Caljodilla – he was using the maritime case as a political coup.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to get the way of the Pacific resettlement," he added.
"This result is an opportunity to see what the past has to overcome."
North Korea says it won't denuclearize unless the U.S. is trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that if the country does not trust Washington, it will never disarm its nuclear arsenal.
He was speaking at a public meeting.
He called upon the nation to follow the commitments made by the Union during the meeting in Singapore during the competition.
His opinion comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stood in the way of resuming stalled nuclear policy, more than three months after his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "vision illusion," which upheld sanctions and U.S. objections to such a declaration, which would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is aware of the adoption of the Declaration without Pyongyang taking the first significant step towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are due to meet again.
But Pyongyang is very skeptical about leaving the country because the country sees it as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the fashion show in Paris presented the latest category of the giant to get to one of the main streets near you.
If you want to increase the collection of your caps or want complete protection from the sun, do not look elsewhere.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie presented a range of large-sized different hats for their SS19 collections, making the Paris Fashion Week the eye-catching style.
This summer, the highly impractical hats made an appearance on Instagram and the designers sent their eye-catching creations to Catwalk.
Valentino’s all-in-one piece was an over-the-top ping pong-colored hat, adorned with a rod that was as wide as a pimple, which beautifully decorated the heads of the models.
Other more-sized accessories included a Kalingad decorated with Amulya gemstones, a magical hat and also an pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thomas Brownie also presented a range of such masks - and that too during the time of Halloween.
Many of the masks were painted in color and looked more like Hannibal Lakers than they were in a better fashion.
One structure was like a scuba diving gear, with vents and goggles, while the other one looked like a dissolved ice cream cone.
If you are able to make use of this great tool, you will be lucky.
Those who observe these styles were speculating that a huge amount of these caps can be found on the main road near you.
The ultra-sized hats were seen on the laps of La Lamba, with a two-foot wide rod, the straw hats on the heads of Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The communal signage behind these highly impractical hats, which was named on social media, sent another large structure to the catwalk - a straw beach bag, like a swimsuit-wearing young model would have taken the little boy.
The black orange rafia bag with a white leather handle was cut by Rafia Jhalar and the best piece in the Jaquemaz la Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told Fimmel: ‘I was expecting big hats and beach bags on the main streets for next summer – the designer made such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for this ultra-sized device.’
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and it has also been running in 2018, adding another set of unusual test results, crediting only individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community activities.
These schools with over 30,000 students across Scotland are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strives to provide the best quality of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their position as a global citizen.
As an education sector that can design and implement pre-scheduled school curriculum, we are looking at modern languages as a topic of choice that is popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it will go straight to his head."
If you speak to a person in a language they understand, it will go straight to his heart.
It is a very important thing to remember that we cannot rely solely on English to establish relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examination, we can see that language leagues with the highest pass rates among independent schools are tops in the tables.
68% of students who learned a foreign language received a higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin received a higher grade A, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners who received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills, which will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
As a subject of choice, language is now being considered in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere as in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that a lack of language skills was responsible for 17% of the reasons given by employers for filling up the vacancy.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important for the youth to prepare for their future careers.
These skills have become essential in a globalized world, with more potential job opportunities requiring language.
Regardless of which career to choose, if they have learned another language, they can get a real benefit in the future due to their lifelong skills like this.
With the ability to interact directly with people from abroad, a multilingual person will automatically be placed at the forefront of the competition.
According to a 2013 UGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of people were unable to speak a foreign language fluently, and only 15 percent of the French language was spoken by double-digits.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially those with a developing economy, will provide better opportunities for children to get meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are plenty of languages to choose from in independent schools, and there is also a teacher class specializing in teaching in related fields.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare students and equip them with the skills to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At this time, a global business environment cannot deny that language is very important for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Bring back the bean.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans are eagerly waiting to see LeBron James play his first match for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in the opening game ahead of Sunday's season in San Diego.
It remains to be seen how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers' Mike Trudeau tweeted that James is likely to play a limited-minute game.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers ahead of the season.
"I don't need a pre-season game to prepare me at this stage of my career," he said.
Timeline of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off the campaign for rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This was the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, with stops at his favored locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the Supreme Court blocking confirmation votes for his election to fill the vacancy, Trump is aiming to rally support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans fear losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for a hearing this week, in a case that has become tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct, leading to a expected Senate confirmation vote for up to a week for an FBI investigation.
But the main aim of these rallies is to help the Republicans get some momentum ahead of the November election.
Thus, Trump's campaign said that the five rallies this coming week are intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"The control of Congress is so important to their agenda that just as we move through this busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters without revealing his name.
The rally tonight scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could bring "a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News said in an opinion poll.
This will be the second visit to West Virginia in a month, from which the state won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The West Virginia Republican Senate is trying to help candidate Patrick Morrisy, who is trailing in the Trump election.
"It's not a good sign for Morsi that the president has to come to help him in these elections," said Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggled to keep such a living while going to Sunday's singles.
After three one-day sessions, Saturday afternoon's quartet gave the performance to the rider cup.
The oscillator of the halo-emotion is a completely invented concept in sports, but it is a thing that the player believes fully, and never more than such a competition.
Where are they going to find this information?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're getting a little bit of momentum now," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe is in a favourable position, with four points ahead and 12 more left in the game.
Americans feel, however, that there is less wind in their way of balls, and they have a lot to encourage, not just because of the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day, and each earned three to four points.
Spieth has been aggressive from tee to green and his leadership is exemplary.
As his round began, the shouts of celebration grew louder, when he and Thomas were two behind, taking an important putt and editing all four squares.
His putt responsible for winning the match when he was 15, caused a stir, which would have made you realize that he believes Americans are still standing in the race.
"You really have to put in a lot of effort and take care of your own match," Spieth said.
It's all about the things that each player has left behind.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
Players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, according to the Ryder Cup's controversial storyline.
Europe's combination, but the attractive pair received four out of four and there was nothing wrong with it.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who could not shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and supported Nou on Friday morning.
That run, and the excitement that was piling up behind the crowd that was screaming, made it seem as if those players were about to lose on Sunday, and as the sun set on Le Golf National, there would have been no more popular players to maintain a potential European victory than Flettwood and Molinari.
It is more convenient to have both at the same time.
However, the history of the European Union has been abysmal.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson reduced the work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foreballs, when he was paired up with Alex Noreen.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dugouts never reached close to a single hole in Spanish and Swedish.
On Sunday, there was no one to help you.
The reason that Foreballs and Foresamus were extremely attractive to look at closely was because there was harmony in the pair, the advice they gave, and the advice they did not give, and the way they were a strategy that could change over time.
Europe has played well as a team, so took a significant lead on the final day, but even in this four-season session, Team USA showed a fighting spirit for it, especially on the stateside, where there was doubt.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will gain a strong advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead over the United States after coming out of Saturday's Foreballs and Foursomes matches.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the match with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods and took their tally to four points over Le Golf National.
Two years ago, Thomas Journey's European team, which lost at Heseltine, won the series 3-1 over the American team that played poorly in the morning foreballs in an attempt to retain the trophy.
In Forsyth, Europe had more resistance and Dr. won matches, but he could not compensate for the losses.
The team needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the title.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were called "Mollywood," were the only pair to win all points from their initial four matches in Ryder Cup history after a thrilling weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the Foreballs, they were even more energized by 5 and 4 in the desperate Woods and America's Bryson Deshbu.
Woods, who was dragged by two matches on Saturday, would occasionally show excellence, but lost 29 of his matches at Foreballs and Foresams, now 19 in 19 and seven in the line.
Rested in the morning foreballs, Justin Rose returned to Foresamus with partner Henrik Stanson and defeated world number ones Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka by 2 and 1.
There is nothing wrong with the fact that Europe should adapt on a sunny and windy day in south-west Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
He defeated the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Polter in the Foreballs by a margin of 2 and 1 and then returned after losing the opening two holes in the Foresams, beating the Poleter and Rory McLaroy in 4 and 3.
Even though the former Fury's team only needed to make one indecision to retain the title, it has happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team made a comeback from a four-point deficit by going into singles.
After being second-best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack felt like they were outside their daughter's.
North Korea has refused to "any way" to become a unilateral disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are driving confidence in the United States and that in such a situation, the country will not unilaterally release nuclear weapons in any way.
At the World Organization's annual general meeting in Ri Yong Ho, North Korea said it had taken "significant measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging not to expand nuclear and nuclear technology.
"We have not received any response from the United States," he said.
"We will not have confidence in our national security without any trust in the U.S. and in such a situation we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Renee reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to the "step" steps to end nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea was to be rewarded for taking gradual steps, her statement is notable, with Pyongyang refusing to stop unilateral nuclear disarmament as it had previously been.
The first meeting between the U.S. President and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12 referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, in which Kim pledged to work towards "closing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump promised to protect North Korea.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang should release its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also called for the lifting of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is first emphasizing on "stopping nuclear disarmament" and forcefully raising the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objective, and also raising objections to "declaring the end of the war," Ri said.
"It's an idea that will bring us down to the knees.
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are making us lose confidence."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which U.S. leaders mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and said: "If South Korea were a party to this problem of stopping nuclear disarmament and the U.S. was not, there would have been no such thing as stopping the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
Even so, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he addressed the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland, including North Korea's rockets, when "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in the move to denuclearize, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should continue until North Korea stops denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for that, saying, “Even if it took two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have disputed this in the UN. Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday at the U.N. Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and definitively until a complete, final and verifiable cessation of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and explosive missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside and said at the UN General Assembly meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
In July, he left Pyongyang as if progress had been made, only for North Korea, within a few hours of making the announcement that they were making "gang-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged that if the United States takes appropriate measures, it would destroy the site of the missile and, as well, the nuclear package."
He said Kim told him that the "relevant measure" he wanted would be to take steps toward restoring the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses to get enough rest.
Harvard University is bringing a new sleep-wake course for all its undergraduates this year to combat the growing male culture through the cafeteria-savvy nightlife.
An educationist found that in one of the world's leading universities when it came to basic information about how to care for yourself, he was often found to be ignorant.
Charles Chizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course that is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
While giving lectures on the impact of education on sleep deprivation, he was inspired to start this course.
“At the end of this, a girl came up to me and said: ‘Why was I told this story when I was in my final year?’
She said she never told anyone about the importance of sleep – which surprised me.
This course, presented for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits are essential for students and athletes to improve their performance as well as their general health.
Paul Barriera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university had decided to start the course after students were found to be severely deprived of sleep over the course of a week.
This one-hour course has a series of interactive goals.
One area features an image of a dorm room, with students taking coffee, and the effects of caffeine and light and sleep deprivation on players' performance, and the curtains, trainers, and books that tell of the importance of sleep time regulation.
In the second part, participants are being told how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then prompts participants to think about their routines.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know – just like you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes, added Professor Chizler.
There is still a culture of pride about staying awake all night, he said, adding that the emphasis on modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality, adequate sleep should be a secret weapon to overcome student stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because if the brain is deprived of sleep, it remains hungry and constantly hungry.
Raymond Gold, a 19-year-old professor of chemical and physical biology, helped design the course, which he took during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a campus-wide course.
He hopes that, in the next stage, all these postgraduate students will be told that they should complete a course like this before entering into a competitive institution.
Professor Chizler recommended that students be alert when to go to sleep and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which will disrupt the clock rhythms in your body, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 – 0 Rangers: Meng's goal gives Gerard's team the sky
The Rangers suffered another setback when Dolly Meng's strike led to Steven Gerrard's dismal side's 1-0 defeat at Livingstone
The Ibrox team was looking for their first win in their way after a 4-1 win at St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team led Gerard to only a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points away from the leading Hearts of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and never saw a team of low-intensity rangers attempt an equaliser.
With the Rangers now pushed to the sixth spot, Livingstone has reached the third spot, only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more problems for the Rangers as one object was thrown from the other end, as the Lionsman had to be treated for injuries on the head of Callum Spain.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, surpassing Ire's changes in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same Livy 11 guys, who had earned one point from Hearts last week, and the way they cornered their opponents at each turn, he would have been very happy.
Although the Rangers kept possession of the ball more, Livingston used more of the ball they had.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Meng's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pitman into an Ann McGregor goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keegan Jacobs, who was on the deep, sent the free-kick captain to Craig Holt, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, came into the back post.
The Rangers took possession but showed a lack of confidence in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morales felt strongly that he and Steven Lawless should have received a penalty on the quarter-finals due to a collision, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers could only shoot two first-half shots at the target but did not have much trouble blocking the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, Lassana Collielie's header and Ovi Izara's unassisted strike.
Although Livi's 34th-minute first goal was against the flow of the game, no one would doubt that he earned it with hard work.
Rangers again failed to counter the set-piece of Jacobs on Deep.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Goulger delivered the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly opted for the men's singles for easy completion.
Gerard showed efficiency by calling Collibel over Ryan Kent's place in the break, and the change was seen as an immediate result. Morlows on the winger gave a pass but the tremendous player Kelly came from his line to block.
However, after Lithgow and Holt hit a long ball one after the other, Livingston continued to force guests to play in their favorite way.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to block Jacobs until Lithgow came from a distant corner.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton made it to the second claim late for the penalty on the hit to Jacobs but Thomson did not pay attention to it again.
Almanac: The Searcher of the Geiger Counter
And now a page in our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, and beyond... on this day in Germany the future physicist Jonas William "Hahns" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, a discovery that further led to the discovery of a device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then in the mainstream of science, the gigar counter has also become a mainstream pop culture, as has the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the roles of scientists like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: “This is the geyser counter, which is used to detect radioactive alkalis like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the impact of the molecules emitted by radiation from the cell."
Evans: "They might say they're popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the search for his name was dead.
A new vaccine for cancer will teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new vaccine for cancer will teach the immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
In this method, the immune cells in the patients are removed and replaced in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common in many cancers and then reintegrate into the body.
This test is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
After being treated with a vaccine that teaches a woman the immune system to recognize evil cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, the immune cells in patients are removed and replaced in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein called HER2, which is common in many cancers, and then reabsorbed in the body.
J. Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancers," explained Professor Berzhofsky, which includes breast, ovarian, lung as well as colorectal cancers.
Similarly, the approach to "teaching" the immune cells out of patients and how to attack cancer cells is useful in a type of blood cancer.
After his appearance in the SNL, Kenny West wore a MAGA hat and slammed Trump in the face.
They didn't like it
After the stupendous performance of Kenny West in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and asked him to run for election in 2020, people stormed the studio during his Saturday Night Live.
On the night of his ghost town in which he has put the Make America Great Cap, after singing a third song, he turned against the Democrats, and he once again expressed his support for Trump.
“How many times have I spoken to a white man and he said: “How could you like Trump, they’re hereditary?”
"If I had been born in the United States, I would have died a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a skit by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star tinkered with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's bullying was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is not yet clear whether West was trying to mock the post of Rock.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had to suffer behind the platform due to a hat on his head.
"They hit me on the back of the head.
He said, “Don’t wear that hat and don’t go on stage.”
They've pissed me off!
And then he said, "I'm completely overwhelmed," he told the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: "Have you seen the submerged place?" So they said, "They put my superman cap on, because you can't tell me what it means to me. Do you think the world should move on?"
Look for love."
His remarks sparked a public outcry at least twice, and SNL cast members appeared to have been Khashoggi, with many saying, one of whom told the publication: "The silence of death spread throughout the entire studio."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West made a lot of people confused by presenting I Love It song in a Perier bottle costume.
West received the support of Condense Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "For the most daring victory: Thanks for standing up for the crowd."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just as it is, and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I will not reward anyone who practices or disseminates ideas that are harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art").
He is free.
"We are also free," he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "officially known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but he followed Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P Daddy.
The co-raper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music emperor Prince, who changed his name to Prince and he was known by the name Prince before the artist.
Man booked for attempt to murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being run over by a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Belihakamore, police said.
The defendants are expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been diagnosed with a deadly virus
Kit Harington is known for his role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticised Mardaani Hero's closeness, saying that such roles on screen often make young children feel that they need to be rock hard to earn respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times culture, Kitt said he believed something was wrong and questioned how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Kit admits that he has a "very strong" desire to solve the problem.
"I feel very strongly personally at the moment - what's wrong with our maturity?" he said.
'What are we teaching them in terms of the problems we are seeing now as people grow older?'
Kite believes that the extremely masculine characters on television are partly responsible for the increase in toxic maturation.
He said, "What is being taught and what is being taught?
Do you want to be a part of what is being taught on TV and on the streets?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change it?
There's something wrong with the kids."
In the interview, he admitted that after the end of Game of Thrones next summer, he would not be prequeling or sequeling it, but he was "tired of races and horses."
From November, Kit will be working on the revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best outcome of Game of Thrones is the meeting of his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so in that sense she gave me my future family and my next life," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played the titular character of John Snow's girlfriend.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a family property ground in Leslie's Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China's new cases rise by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in its HIV/AIDS population.
Health officials said more than 8,20,000 people were affected in the country.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through intercourse, which indicates changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly due to contaminated blood in some parts of China.
But this route has reduced the number of people infected with HIV to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 1,00,000 every year.
HIV infection by sexual intercourse is a major problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has increased everywhere.
The study's findings suggest that an estimated 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women due to the country's conservative values.
Insufficient protection in such relationships leads to most of the diseases.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to the global availability of HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee had breached the GOP senator's data, saying it was a "dangerous lie" and "conspiracy theory."
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
Democrats of Los Angeles asserted that the claims were air-dropped by pundits and websites of the "right-wing group."
"Falseness, lies, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published allegedly included residential addresses and phone numbers of Lindsey Graham of U.S. Senators South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information posted by the unidentified man on Capitol Hill appeared online on Thursday during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The three senators were then examined.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedStat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and the information was displayed by an employee of Waters, The Hill reported.
“These baseless allegations are completely false and fabricated,” Waters added.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - is not responsible for the information being broken in any way."
These baseless allegations are completely false and baseless.
Waters' statement was immediately criticised online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s annoying,” Fleischer writes.
“This shows that her nature does not qualify her to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, it's not fair to get angry.
They should not be disturbed.
They do not want to doubt the motives of the accused.
They need to be safe and happy."
The reaction of Fleischer Waters was compared to criticism of Justice Kavanaugh of the Democrats, who was furious during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is contesting the midterm elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
"It's a really big thing," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the criminals are exposed," she added, "and they will be held legally responsible for all acts that are dangerous to their destroyers and any or all members of my staff."
John English Strikes Again Review - Less Effective Rowan Atkinson's Intelligence Irresponsible
It is now a tradition to see the effects of Brexit on British art in any new film, and it also applies to the Johnny English action-comedy irony franchise - which began as Johnny English in 2003 and revived as Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
We'll be happy to see how much we'll be able to contribute to the future of our country.
In any case, the rubbery faceless Johnny English has a second renewal of his cooking license - a warning from his name that he has a huge comic creation design for moviegoers in non-English areas.
He's certainly a fool's secret agent who's giving a weird boost to the lingering glamour he feels a little Mr. Bean-like Klauso (stupid police) and that guy's goof contributes a note to the smoke of the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
That character is based on a traveller and a mysterious international man who played a role in Barclays TV commercials once forgotten by Atkinson and adds to his confusion.
There are also a couple of great moments in this latest J.E. film.
I love the fact that John goes to the helicopter wearing a medieval armored dress and hits his head with the wings.
Atkins appears to be a gift of physical humor, but, the humor seems to be far less effective and especially the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now seem oddly unnecessary in the background in that they incorporate humor faithfully as a component.
Comedy is not for adults, but for young children, and I don't think Johnny English's crazy accident was as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-film comedy in the form of bean.
The UK is now in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker exposes the identity of all UK work agents by entering the UK's spy's super-secret web network, which surprises the work agent - a very small role for Kevin Alden.
There is one last hope for the Prime Minister, who is fierce and quarrelsome and whose political popularity has already dwindled: Emma Thompson has made Terezha-May-like characters very nice, but she doesn't have much room in the story to do anything else.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that she will have to bring someone who has retired as a result of each active spy's information is revealed.
And that means stupid Johnny English, currently working as a school teacher in a luxurious colony, teaches extra-curricular lessons on how to become an intelligence operative: there are some great jokes here, because English makes the school an academy of rock-type espionage.
The Englishman is again summoned to the Whitehall for an emergency briefing, and again meets with his long-time colleague, Bo, who plays Bell Miller.
Bow is now married, married to a submarine commander, Jolly-Hockey-Sticks role in which the ability of an artist like Vicky Pepperdine is wasted.
In every magisterial secret service, Batman and Robin face off against Olga Kurilenko's beautiful wife, Offelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, Karishmai Tech, who claims that the Prime Minister can solve Britain's computer problems, is under the dangerous influence of a millionaire: the terrible Jason Volta, invented by Jack Lacy.
English and Bo begin their journey of ridiculous fun: in the costume of a waiter, they set fire to a bustling French restaurant; they confuse themselves with the luxurious yacht of the Volta; and the English indulge in chaos by trying to put on virtual reality headsets to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volta's house.
For the last episode, all the episodes have been dragged out, but from what it is as funny and riotous as it looks like a children's TV show.
Very good material.
And just like other Johnny English films, I wondered: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
The Labour Party rejected plans by the British to work four days a week and get five days wages
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party says the British are considering a radical plan to work four days a week and get a five-day salary.
The party reportedly feels that the money saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution should be given to employees by giving them an extra day's leave.
This will give the employees a three-day week, but there will be no reduction in salary.
According to sources, the idea is a “scrambler” in the party’s economic agenda and policies to tilt the country towards the interests of its employees.
The four-day week was rewarded by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy change is expected to be announced later this year.
"It will not happen overnight but a four-day work week is an aspiration which is in tune with the party's vision to rehabilitate the economy in the interest of the employees as well as the party's overall industrial policy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such an idea, the Green Party had promised a four-day work week in their campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this aspiration has not been fully rewarded by the Labour Party so far.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Four-day work week is not the policy of the party and it has not been considered by the party.
Last week's Labour Conference was used by Finance Minister John McDonnell to explain his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy in more detail.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the "faceless directors" of the service companies and the "benefits" of utility companies.
The Finance Minister's scheme per se also means that the existing investors in the water bodies cannot get back the full share of their investment as the labour government can 'deduct' on the basis of the irregularities seen there.
He also reaffirmed the plans to take workers to the company's board of directors and create a comprehensive ownership fund to fund 10 per cent of the shares of private sector entities to employees eligible for annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh has changed their views.
The FBI's investigation into Justice Brett Kavanaugh's allegations has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions about whether any Republican party members could be reluctant to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes," journalist Scott Pelli asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had been able to find something that could change their views.
Kennedy spoke more freely than his colleagues in South Carolina.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I went to the court and spoke to Mr. Kavanaugh.
All this happened, when he came to the charges, I called him and said, 'Why did you do this?'
He was unmoved, unmoved, and unmoved."
Graham's opinion, however, seemed to be settled.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and only one big accusation can change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has vehemently denied that accusation," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not every person who has been named has been able to identify her.
It is 36 years old.
I don't think this is going to change."
Is there anything they can do to alleviate poverty?
The annual Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York on Saturday, with the biggest stars taking part in it, and the goal of the event is equally strong; the eradication of global poverty.
In this seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival, a group of thousands of people will come together in the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the art of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendis but also to spread the true purpose of this event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international campaign group that hopes to reduce poverty by increasing the number of people fighting for poverty.
To get a free entry to this event (if you don’t want to buy a VIP entry), the audience of the event had to go through a whole series of acts or “acts” such as volunteering to spread their goal of global elimination, emailing a global leader, calling or adopting any other meaningful means.
But how successful has the global citizenry been in achieving its goals?
The idea of organizing a free music festival for people is an honest way to motivate people to take action, or is it just another form of so-called "cliquetivism" that people think makes a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters for different purposes since 2011.
He says his actions have helped global leaders to push for the release of pledges and policies of $ 3,700 million or more, which will impact more than 225 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group documented 390 promises and declarations generated by their actions, of which at least $1 trillion has already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the funds available have so far directly impacted the lives of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Power of Nutrition is a partnership of investors and organizers in the UK, which "helps young children progress to their full potential" and who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, have promised to fund 35 million dollars to address malnutrition in Rwanda.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of under-nutrition negligible like a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Goodwill Ambassador Tracy Ulman told the audience at a music festival in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional assistance.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website is, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "This will be a big and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, we will succeed like the common rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because coming together has increased our strength.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monne are some of the artists who will be presenting at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Debora-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use U.S. Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports
US Secretary of State Ryan Zink has made it clear that Washington will use the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching other markets, including the Middle East.
Zink has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where Russia is working at the invitation of their legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"They're in the Middle East because I think they want to harness energy like Eastern Europe, Southern Europe," he said.
And according to the officials, these are the ways and means of handling.
"The United States has the ability to cool down if needed, while ensuring that sea lanes remain open to ensure their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zink was speaking at an event organised by the profit-making group, the Consumer Energy Alliance, which calls itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's stances on Russia and Iran's dealings and noted that they are effectively the same.
"Taking advantage of the fuel and using the substituted fuel is the cheapest option compared to Iran and Russia," he said, referring to Russia as "one-trick pony" and said that Russia's economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The move comes as Trump's administration seeks to replace Russia with a cheaper alternative to European consumers by increasing its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
Accordingly, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. According to Trump, Moscow has "occupied" Berlin because of that project.
Moscow has reiterated that the $1100 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 11,000 cubic meters, is a fully affordable project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is only due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"Energy may not be a means to create pressure and I think it is our shared view that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has been under intense pressure from Germany for the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading industry body in Germany, has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the two-party agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"That's a big question for me when our energy supply is interfered with by a third country," said Dieter Kemf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be paying "very careful attention" to the 2020 presidential election, a Massachusetts MP said.
Massachusetts MP Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "carefully" focus on the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During the Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider contesting the election.
"Now is the time for women to come to Washington and restore their broken government, and that includes the act of a woman holding the highest office," she said.
"After November 6, I will carefully look at the presidential election."
President Donald Trump was "leading this county in the wrong direction," Warren said during a debate with Trump during the town hall.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has made a clear statement, criticizing Trump and Kavanaugh, who have been nominated to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday found that most people in Warren's own constituency don't think he should run in the 2020 presidential election.
Eighty-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said Warren should not contest the election, according to the Saffouk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent of voters supported the measure.
The poll showed former Governor Deval Patrick received 38 per cent of the support and 48 per cent of the opposition in the run-up to the polls.
Other key democratic names discussed in the context of the 2020 election included Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont MP Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin gave the example of Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting.
The 26-year-old spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"Looking at what my son is going through, what he's going through, and how he's coming back, I can understand a little bit about other families who are facing the devastating consequences of PTSD and the wounded condition our soldiers are returning to," he told an audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an "extremely captive elephant" and said of her son and other soldiers, "When they come back, they're a little different, they're bitter, they come back thinking that the respect that their soldiers and every member of the Airmen and the Army have for the country is here."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and domestic violence with interfering with a woman's report on domestic violence and possession of narcotics, Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett said.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge to the new Asura Policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies neighborhood facilities to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday to support a whistleblower who opposes the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace V. The details of the session suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the collective policy have not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the children of her violent gang member" misbehaved with her, but U.S. officials declined a request for her accommodation on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as a country facing the problem of gang and domestic violence, where the number of applicants for U.S. bases is very large.
A decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014 was overturned due to the U.S.'s new asylum policy, a decision that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of state, union and international law."
"All claims for asylum under federal law must be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances in that claim, and such a ban violates that rule," the Friend-of-the-Court brief said.
Stating that migrants are more likely to become professionals and "provide essential workers", the lawyers in the brief further argued that denial of entry to migrants would harm the U.S. economy
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a judge in June to stop allowing victims of domestic violence and gang violence to enter the neighborhood.
"As a member of a particular social group or political ideology, there is room for those who leave their country out of fear or persecution," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
People all over the world were never expected to solve all the problems they faced on a daily basis, even all the serious problems.
Efforts are being made to rescue the victims as the number of dead has doubled in the pursuit of finding the living
The situation was worse for the living.
A 35-year-old mother of a child with fever in her home town of Palu, said, “I feel a lot of stress”.
Every minute, an ambulance arrives.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen picking up their water-logged belongings, trying to save anything they could find, going back to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were severely flooded.
Some of the injured, including two Harriss with broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent severe renal failure.
His eyes were filled with memories of the earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was buried under a pile of wall clay," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family had gone to the city to get married.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "suppression" with the help of propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement promoting the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the U.S. press of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda on Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China rejected - Iowa State's highest-grossing newspaper - citing the Chinese daily's paid supply in the Des Moines Register.
Trump's allegation that China tried to manipulate the US election is a new chapter in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China, as U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say the response fee imposed by China at the start of the trade war was designed to influence exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who has long been the governor of Iowa, which exports large quantities of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, Branstad writes, "China is now doubling down on voter suppression in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free journalism by providing paid advertising in Des Moines to spread its own propaganda,” Branstad writes.
"On the contrary, newspapers that are put up for sale on the streets of Beijing lack the anti-surrender and lack the true reflection of the differing opinions of the Chinese people on China's troubled economic trajectory, as the media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
He added that "a major Chinese newspaper has turned down an offer to publish his article," but did not name the paper.
Analysts have warned that women are polarizing voters through the defeat of the Republican Cavanaugh before the midterms
Analysts have warned that many top Republicans, particularly women, will be hit in the upcoming midterm elections, as they stand and defend the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, on various counts of sexual harassment.
This is a very serious issue and most Republicans are against it.
Those things can't be reversed," Grant Rehr, professor of political science at Maxwell College at Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Rehar said there was "suspicious" whether the proposal put forward by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation at the time would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow, and they won't forget in November," said senior adviser to the progressive group, Muvon, as well as national spokesperson, Karen Jean-Pierre, in a statement Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate Hallway shouted "November is coming!" as Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford backed Cavano's nomination.
"Democrat's enthusiasm and motivation is flowing," a fair political analyst, Stu Roddenberg, told the news site.
“People say it’s already at the highest level; it’s true.
But it can grow even further, especially to the volatile women voters in the suburbs, as well as young voters 18- to 29-year-olds who don’t like the president, they don’t usually vote.”
Even before the public evidence provided by Ford detailing her sexual harassment allegations against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that she could be hit if Republicans agreed with her confirmation.
"This is now a mess for the GOP," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee's opinion or the final opinion or whether Cavano will be chosen, it's also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they treated her," Gay Cecil, director of the Priority USA group that helped elect Democrats, told news channel.
However, in the background of the testimonies of Ford and Cavanaugh, there appears to be a duplicity among Americans as to who to trust, of which Cavanaugh appears slightly more inclined.
In a new poll conducted by Yugwin, 41 percent of respondents said they believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in Cavano, either definitively or prospectively.
Also, 38 percent of the respondents said that while Cavano lied definitively or potentially during the testimony, only 30 percent said so in Ford's case.
Following Flake's request, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was attacked by Cavanaugh in a drunken state when he was 17.
Ramirez alleged that during his studies at Yale in the 1980s, a Supreme Court nominee at a party exposed his gender.
World Wide Web fathers are planning to launch a new internet to counter Google and Facebook
World Wide Web researcher Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup that will compete with rivals like Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the well-known technologist, ‘Inert’, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where their data should be stored and which information should be given access to which people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the previous purpose of Inrupt was "to dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to help people create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may include contact lists, payment lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This means that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in the same browser and at the same time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that it remains entirely in the hands of the user to decide which type of information to handle.
This is called "personal ability through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring the company resources, processes, and the right skills to make solids available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased from Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, an employee of some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change that will make all of their business models go down completely overnight."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that INSERT's "aim is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has raised an effective voice in the Net Neutrality debate.
Even while launching InnerPt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic for the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Von: Celebrating the First World War Victoria Cross Cleric
It was celebrated 100 years later in honor of the Church of England's only clergyman who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior in the First World War.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Vaughan had won the prize in the September 29, 1918, attack on the Belinglais and Lehcourts.
However, four days later, he was shot dead by a hidden fraternal soldier and never realized that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled a coffin built in his memory at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the unveiling of the tomb was exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vaughan led the battalion to cross the Canal de Saint-Quentin "from the very dense fog and from the heavy firing from the battlefield and from the firing of machine guns."
They then proceeded to the firing line and took the line "extremely bravely" before losing three detachments, facing the cannons on the battlefield alone.
Lt. Col. Vaughan was killed by a German sniper about a month before the war ended on October 4, 1918.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "an act that I would never be able to do but a salute to."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also laid wreaths after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said it was "a great honour to take part in the parade," adding that "the support offered by the crowd demonstrated the bravery of the genuine brave men."
MMA fans woke up all night to see the Beetlear 206, but instead they had to see the Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to watch a really-full bilter 206, but you've been denied the main event.
San Jose's bells had 13 matches, including six on the main card, and were to be shown live on Channel 5 in the UK overnight.
At 6 a.m., Gerard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face each other, instead of showing their coverage, broadcasting Peppa Pig to a UK audience.
Some of the people who woke up in the morning for that fight were disappointed.
One fan wrote on Twitter about the cartoons of children as "a kind of cruel joke."
When asked about the broadcast, "According to government regulations, it was not broadcastable at 6 a.m., so they had to put on a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and broadcasting at Blatter.
"Peppa the Pig, yes."
Billator Company Chairman Scott Cocker said he would reconsider his schedule to accommodate future UK audiences.
"I think when I thought about the replay, I thought we could do it," Cooker said.
"But it was six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we couldn't do it until our Sunday, that is, their Monday."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of messages after that change and they weren't all friends.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government matter.
I can assure you that will not happen again.
We've always wanted to play five games instead of six, and we've tried to give more to the fans, but we've failed.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'innocent' about sex
Olympic diva Tom Daily says he began to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said: "Not everyone is like me until I go to secondary school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about the rights of gay people to provide "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent made him less appreciative of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, took several months off due to illness.
Attending Laverne's first event as an outcast, Deli said he felt "responsible" when he was older than everyone else, because "it was not acceptable to society to like boys and girls."
He said: "To date, this feeling of feeling inferiority and separation has been the key thing that has given me the strength and power to succeed."
I wanted to show them that I'm "someone," he said, so that when people find out about their sexuality, they won't disappoint them.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics became a daily high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more and more countries not to consider homosexuality a punishable offence.
He said he was lucky enough to live freely without fear of being exposed to the adverse consequences of his actions, and wanted others to show them "hope."
Three-time world champion said Men's - who met in 2013, fell in love with U.S. film-maker Dustin Lance Black - "they were amazing."
The Daily married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you've suffered so much at such a young age" - he participated in the Olympics for the first time when he was 14 and then his father died of cancer in just three years - said it's hard to find a person of this age who's seen so many ups and downs.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and the Daily said their "whole approach" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, the Olympics are more important than the gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
He named his son Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
The Daily said that his father had not accepted that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I don't think you're going to be able to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding their hands when they took their last breath and I wasn't sure they were invincible until their breath really stopped and they died," he said.
The following year, Deli won the bronze medal by participating in the 2012 Olympics.
"I knew there couldn't be a higher feeling than what I had dreamed my whole life - diving into the Olympic Games in front of home spectators," he said.
The inspiration for his selection of his first song was the same - the Proud by Heather Small - who joins him in preparation for the Olympics and still has a bite on his body.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Michael Jackson was picked as an extra player for the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Michaelson will set a new record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get his form back so that this milestone doesn't get painful.
Michaelson, who has played in the biennial event 12 times in a row, is being replaced by captain Jim Furyk as an additional player for Saturday's Foreballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being involved in the actual game, as he always does for the United States, this five-time major winner divided the focus on the game in the range in the hopes of promoting his day and eliminating the factors that caused his game to deteriorate.
Even though his career is in full swing, with never the most straightforward driver, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not ideal for such a disciplined Lee Golf National Course, where the long-legged part never forgives the wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't as challenging, Michaelson will face precise British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans start 12 singles matches when they are four points behind, in the absence of a good start, Michaelson's match can be very important.
He was confident in his game and couldn't think of anything else to say.
"Today he fully understands his role, he put a stop on my back and put his hand around my neck and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's the Hall of Fame and has given a lot to these teams before and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I wanted to do more, but I wanted to do it this way.
He wants to be there for everyone."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record of most matches of the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
Perhaps this will be the end of his Ryder Cup career that will never be able to equal the height of his personal record.
Michaelson won 18 matches, lost 20 and missed seven, Furyk said, adding that his presence earned the team an intangible value.
"He's funny, he's witty, he likes to entertain people and he's a great person to be with," he explained.
"It's going to be fun for the young players, as well as this week, who would love to watch.
It's not just a game, it's a lot more."
Europe's captain Thomas Bourne knows that the big front may soon disappear
The European captain, Thomas Bourne, knows from his experience that a sufficient lead ahead of the singles matches in the last day's Ryder Cup can easily be reversed in an inconvenient ride.
Dane made his debut in a match at Vald<0xC3><0xA9>rama in 1997, when the Sea Ballesteror-led side took a five-fold lead over the Americans but when the matches ended, they were stunned and won by only the smallest margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You have to remember yourself that we had a big lead in Valdemar, we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won at Valdemar, but only by a small margin," Bourne said, looking at the 5-3 win class of both Friday and yesterday, which led 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in that team that this is not the end.
You'll have to fill in tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until you get the hang of it.
Our goal is to win the trophy and we will focus on that.
I've said all the things, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're aware of who's on our other side - the greatest players in the world."
Bourne was pleased with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, saying: "I can never get ahead of me in this.
Tomorrow's challenge is different.
Tomorrow's show is going to be different.
It is good to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you go there alone, how does it feel to be a golfer?
This is the message that you have to give to the players to perform your best tomorrow.
Now, you want to leave your partner behind and also do his best."
In contrast to Bourne, the opposing group Furyk will focus on doing better in individual performances than the paired performances by his players, with the exception of Rodon Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself turned the match against Europe by the "miracle of the day," before that defeat, as part of a winning team on both sides of those big last-day turnarounds.
In 1999, when captain Crenshaw asked his players how they got ahead on the last day, he replied, "I remember every word of it."
"Tomorrow is your 12 important matches, but you have to start as fast as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Medina."
When he is moving in one direction, he puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We'll set up our line-up accordingly and put our players in this position that you think we're going to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was sent ahead of the performance to try to fight back and he had to face Rory McLroy in the top game, followed by Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood, and other Europeans at the top half of the order.
"I put these players in this order because I thought they would cover all sides," Bourne said when talking about his single selections.
Germany's new war ship has been delayed again
According to local media reports, the German navy's latest warship was supposed to be operational in 2014 to replace warships during the Cold War, but due to poor systems and high prices, it will not arrive until at least next year.
According to a military spokesman, the operation of the "Royland-Faiz", one of the major battleships in the Baden-Wuttenberg-class combat misadventure, has now been postponed to the first six months of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but post-disaster problems pushed the future of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wutmburg-class ships, which the Navy had requested in 2007, will come to replace the Bremen-class battleship.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile, as well as some hidden technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - the latest combat mistakes should be able to be deployed away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay meant that modern warships - allowing Germany to demonstrate power at sea - would have already expired when they entered service, Die Zeit noted.
The unfortunate F125 battle went wrong last year, when German naval officers refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Lom & Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media said there were several important "software and hardware flaws" and that it was not useful to deploy warships on combat missions.
Software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuttenburg-class ship would be operated by 120 sailors – half of the human workforce on the old Bremen-class battleships.
Also, it was observed that the boat was very heavy which would reduce its performance and make it impossible for the Navy to upgrade in future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhyland-Fais" is believed to be twice the weight of similar-class boats used by Germany in World War II.
Along with faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It has grown from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion - to such an amazing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In the wake of Germany's declining naval power, the latest combat mistakes are of particular importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy had "really been running out of ships."
The official said that the problem is increasing rapidly as time goes by, as old boats have been de-activated, but new ships have not come in their place.
He regretted that none of the combatants in the Baden-Wuttenburg-class had the ability to enter the Navy.
National Trusts Steal the Secret Life of Bats
New research has been carried out in the Scottish Hill region to reveal how bats use the terrain to search for food.
It is hoped that the new discovery will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation work.
A study by researchers from the National Trust of Scotland will track the normal and soprano pipistreles, as well as brown long-eared and douben bats, at the Inverve Gardens in Wester Ross.
In order to track the activity of bats throughout the season, special soundprints will be placed on the property at a prominent place.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-delivered detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all soundprints will determine the frequency of the calls of bats and determine what species are doing.
A natural habitat map and report will then be prepared to present a detailed picture of their behaviour on the terrain-scale.
Rob Daver, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which area of natural habitat is important for bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help in determining the benefits of the management of natural habitats such as the formation of pastures and how best to preserve the forest land for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly in the last century.
They are endangered due to loss of habitat and natural habitat affected by construction and development works.
Air turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as well as some chemical processes of flypeppers and construction materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, their habit of hunting at night makes their ears more useful than their eyes to catch prey.
They use state-of-the-art eco-location techniques to detect insects and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for taking care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has taken the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect hostels and sometimes even carry out rescue operations.
The institute set up Scotland's first and only left-wing bat reserve at Three Estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
David Thompson, manager of the estate, said that the estate is an ideal territory for them.
"There's a good area for bats at Trive," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good natural habitats.
But, there are many things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we are doing here and on other properties will help us understand more and more about what is needed for their upliftment."
They emphasise the need to investigate bats before maintaining property as it can lead to the inadvertence of a single maternal residence, which can lead to the death of 400 females and babies, and the risk of the local population being completely destroyed.
The bats are protected and it is an offence by law to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the bat conservation trust, Elizabeth Ferrellini, encouraged people to help.
She said: “We have a lot to complain about our bats because we don’t know what the status of our population of many species is.”
Ronaldo has denied the rape allegations, and prosecutors are preparing to file a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him "fake news" and said people "want to publicize them" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Myerga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was accused of giving her $375,000 to keep her mouth shut about the incident.
Hours after the claim was made, the 33-year-old Ronaldo, speaking to his 142 million followers on Instagram live video, said the news was likely to be "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
"What he said today was false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in front of the camera.
They want to use my name.
Its normal.
They are trying to get fame by calling my name, but this is part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine," he added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations, which Reuters says is an "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the private sector."
Lawyer Christine Shertz said the player could seek compensation for "a breach of moral damages, which is potentially one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times, equivalent to coverage."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Myerga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he raped her in the ass.
Mayorga claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo knelt down and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man" and "one percent" disappointed her.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but said it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photographs of her wounds taken at the hospital, but then she agreed to a court-out-of-court settlement because she felt "too scared" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old Mayorga says she's now defying the settlement because she's still nervous about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer went to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK will be 'permanently remorseful' for the release of the carmakers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "continue to repent" if it lost its global lead in car production following Brexit.
He further said that "a matter of concern" means that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain exits the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at a factory in Bernstone, near their derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, the delay in the border may lead to the loss of jobs.
The Bernstone plant - where Toyota's Oris and Avensis are produced - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
"I think we'll see if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, when production in our factory stops," said Marvin Cook, managing director at Toyota's Bernstein.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concern over how cross-border trade would operate if they exit the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says they will shut down their mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of manufacturers is that the supply chain will be at risk if a no-deal Brexit occurs.
Toyota's production line runs on the principle of "in time," where spare parts are coming from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for cars manufactured on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without any deal before March 29, there could be a reversal of the border, and the industry believes that there may be a delay for the holiday areas and they may fall short.
It will be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of cargo in its Derbyshire plant, and according to the company, this will lead to a shutdown of production.
Mr Clark said the checkers' plan for Theresa May's future relationship with the EU was "purely calibrationd to avoid cross-border checks."
"We need to get a deal done for ourselves. We want a best deal, like I said, for the moment we don't want to just make it successful and happy, but we should take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC4's Today programme.
"This evidence is not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, for which we need to sustain this, through which the supply chain will remain extremely successful."
Toyota could not say how long the production would stop, but in the long run, warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, of course, affect jobs.
Peter Suvallis, who worked for 24 years in Bernstone and is a United Union convenor at the plant, said his members are extremely concerned: "According to my experience, once their jobs are gone they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House said.
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "suspended another week" because of a dispute with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which includes Russia's election interference, links between Trump's allies and Russia, and an investigation into potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors have been circulating in Washington for months that Trump will not show or show the deputy attorney general the way out, and that Mueller's freedom could be threatened.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein planted a wire to record talks with Trump, through which the president was likely to be removed by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House to discuss his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" the expulsion of Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was to be attended by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavanaugh and him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The date is not fixed, it could be this week, I think it could be pushed back another week, looking at the other issues that are going on with the Supreme Court.
"I've always loved watching the news."
Some journalists argued through which this was certain: Sanders has not given details to the White House press since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders also said that there was no "attemptiness" to the TV journalists' "performance" for the lack of details. "I don't deny this reality that they're showing."
He added that there will be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
“These presidents conduct more Q&A sessions than any previous president,” she said, and then said without giving evidence: “We’ve seen those figures.”
Sanders said: “If journalists get a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it will be far better than talking to me.
We try very hard to do that, and in the last few weeks you've already done that, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, it will take the place of giving details to the press."
Trump regularly hears questions when he leaves the White House or attends a press conference with high-ranking White House officials who are in open session or visiting the White House.
There is hardly a single press conference.
This week in New York, the president may have given reasons for careless and bizarre presentations to journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary wrote to the EU staff at the NHS Scotland about the concerns of Brexit.
The Health Secretary wrote to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in the public services we hold responsible for.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "All summer, negotiations continued between the UK and the EU on exit, which are expected to be decided in the coming autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible deal-plus situation.
I know this is going to be a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate that irrespective of their nationality, I consider the contribution of every member of the staff to be of great value.
Co-workers in the EU and beyond bring invaluable skills and experiences, which strengthen and improve the functioning of health care, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we sincerely want you to stay here.
Kristen Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after she suffered a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebreaker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Wanderbilt Commodores in Saturday's game, the Tennessee State Tigers' Mike Organon said.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reedy, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-left.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there," Reid said.
The coach and medical staff administered oxygen to the abercrombie on the sideline before placing it on the stretcher and for further diagnosis.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, was playing his first season for Tennessee State after migrating from Illinois.
Earlier on Saturday, he had picked up a total of five tackles, bringing his total to 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty to purchase property in the UK.
More stamp duty will be charged from foreign buyers to purchase property in the UK and the additional money will be used for the homeless under the New Tory scheme.
This step will mark the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp duty will be levied for those, who do not pay taxes in the UK.
To help the homeless - the treasury is expected to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million a year.
Theresa May is set to announce that more stamp duty will be levied on overseas buyers to buy property in the UK and that the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be understood as an attempt to counteract Jeremy Corbyn's campaign's success in attracting young voters with a pledge to provide more affordable homes and target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to untaxed individuals and companies in the UK, and additional money will boost the government's campaign to help people who sleep on the streets.
Surcharge – This will be in line with the higher rates imposed on other houses two years ago, which will be subject to the present stamp duty and can be expensive up to 3 per cent for hire purchase.
The move is expected to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million a year to the treasury.
According to an estimate, 13 percent of the newly built London property is purchased by non-UK citizens, making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to step up their prices.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost villages” due to foreign buyers, as they spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson's announcement of a stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of buying land but not using it to raise property prices, and he urged Mrs May to remove reservation on affordable homes, so as to eliminate the "homelessness" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of targeted housing reforms, including the control of rents and an end to "in the absence of" evictions.
They also want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to the restoration of the dreams of a better life for the British people - every new generation.
This is to create a sustainable housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it will not be easy to buy homes for people who do not live in the UK, as well as British residents who work hard for overseas companies.
For many people, the dream of owning a dream home has become far-fetched, and the indignity of those who sleep on the streets has become a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become the manager of Scotland"
Sunderland owner Jack Ross said his “last goal” was to become Scotland’s manager one day.
Scott, 42, is enjoying the challenges while reviving the North-East club, and is three points short of the top spot and third in League One.
They have moved on to the Stadium of Light this summer, guiding St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B cap and that's all I got," Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But when I was a kid, I grew up watching my father play Scotland at Hampden, and that's what has always pushed me.
That opportunity will only come when I succeed in managing the club."
Prior to Ross as the manager of Sunderland, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio had worked as managers.
The owner of the former Alloa Athletic said there was no fear of following such well-established names in such a large club, when his proposals were rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will be measured by whether I will take this club to the Premier League or not.
"Because of the structure and facilities in this club, this club is undoubtedly eligible to go to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but if I can get the club back there, maybe I'll find myself successful."
After a 15-month period of assistant owners and training staff at Hearts at Dumbarton, Ross's management career has only been three years.
He then helped Alois improve to the third tier from exiting and helped St. Mirren to the winner's trophy from the possibility of exiting later in the season.
And Ross says he feels more satisfied than ever with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academy.
He said, "Aloha's burden is to accept that it's "probably really square."
"I really think management was more appropriate for me, even more so than playing."
It sounds strange because I played right, made the road less comfortable, and enjoyed some of the top spots along the way.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
Even today, I still go through the stress and pressure of work, but management seems to be right for me.
I always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel most satisfied as I've been working on my own interests throughout my adult life."

According to the survey, the exact time of drinking is 5.30 pm on Saturday.
The summer heat has boosted the British pound, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Pub and bar groups grew by 2.7 per cent in July, but the restaurant business declined by 4.8 per cent, data showed.
Peter Martin of the Commercial Advice Center CGA who compiled the figures, said: "Constant sunlight and England's longer participation in the World Cup than expected, also meant a repeat of the previous June month format in July, with the pub's business up 2.8 per cent, excluding a further shock to restaurants.
The restaurant's business fell by 1.8 percent in June.
The pubs and barbers that provided more drinks than the restaurant business were doing very well.
Even though the food processors were not as dramatic as the restaurants, they were also weak in the heat.
Some people just want to drink.
Sales of beverages in well-managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in that month, while consumption of foodstuffs declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman of RSM, a comfort and hospitality analyst, said: "We are seeing this result as a trend that has been going on since late April.
When it comes to outdoor market sales, the weather and important social or sporting events become the most effective factors.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are struggling, although a 4.8 per cent drop from the previous year will be especially painful at current cost pressures.
The long hot summers should not have come at a time when it was a tough period for the drivers who sold the substance, and only time can tell if the moderate temperatures we experienced in August can provide the much-needed relief."
The overall sales growth in July in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 percent, indicating a slowdown in brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, whose combined turnover is more than 9 cents and established industry parameters, monitors sales of 47 driving groups and analyzes their performance data.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents.
One in five children — some as young as 11 — has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents and teachers, the survey revealed.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase of "fake Insta" pages.
The news has caused a lot of concern that sexual content is being posted in it.
Twenty percent of students say that their “main” account is meant to show off to the parents.
One in five children — some as young as 11 — are creating social media accounts that keep secrets from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed that “fake Insta” accounts are growing rapidly – a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has caused a lot of concern that sexual content is being posted in it.
Twenty percent of students say their cleaned “main” accounts are meant to be shown to parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother came around when she first requested others to "rape me" on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
Research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Headmasters and Headmasters of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two acquaintances, and half of them admitted to having a private account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "So many teens are eager to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find."
Ilyich Doyle will be the "voice of the players" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Aileen Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous track and field player, and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those operating the sport to benefit from his extensive experience internationally for more than a decade.
Aileen has great respect for the Scottish, UK and global players' community and we are confident that bringing them on board will greatly benefit the players in Scotland," said BT.
Doyle said: "I'm eager to be a voice for the players and I hope I can contribute and guide the game in Scotland."
At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, the American who won in the 200 and 400 meters of his four Olympic gold medals, has now become a regular BBC pundits, unable to walk after a transit ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said I would be fine or not, and only time would tell.
It was exhausting work, but I was completely healed, learned how to walk again, and today I practice agility!
Thank you for the encouragement!"
There have been a lot of online debates about the importance of breastfeeding compared to mothers.
Online votes were split over an advertisement that compared breastfeeding women to cows displayed by a breast pump company.
Launching a pump known as "the world's first cool-to-use breast pump," consumer tech company Elvini released an ad featuring a contraband music video demonstrating the freedom it gives breastfeeding mothers with new pumps.
The four real mothers dance on the rhythm of the song in a cage full of cows: "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you don't pay attention, they're not cuddling, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on to sing: "Pump this, pump this, I'm feeding the babies, pump this, pump this, I'm extracting my women's milk."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of thousands of views, the video received mixed responses from viewers, with many of them believing that the dairy industry's "trauma" has been taken too lightly.
"It's a good idea to use this product."
Except for the fact that within a few days of giving birth, their baby is removed from them, just like us, they become pregnant and give birth to a baby to give milk.

Another commented: "Of course, it is dangerous for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't they use it to promote breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?"
Another wrote: "This is an unsubstantiated advertisement."
While others supported the ad, a woman accepted the song as "fun."
"I think that's a great idea.
If I had more milk, I would have had one.
I felt like a bomb
This ad is a bit crazy but I think it's the right thing to do
It's an unusual product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This funny ad is for mothers who pump (usually in their workplace or toilet) and make them feel like cows."
This ad is not an ad that praises or predicts the milk industry."
At the end of the video, she reveals that a group of women were dancing by sitting pumps in their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the perspective of many women who feel like cows to women who use breast-pumps.
However, the Elvi pump is completely quiet, does not have wires or ducts and sits accurately in the nursing bra, which gives women freedom of movement, can hold children, and can also go out during pumping.
Anna Ballarin, partner and ECD at Mother, expressed the view: The Elvi pump is a revolutionary product, which needs to be launched in an open and stimulating manner.
By showing a similarity between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we had to highlight the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump was offering us, in an interesting and relevant way, breast pumping and all its challenges.
This is not the first time that Elvi bombs have come to light.
During the London fashion sale, for designer Marta Jakobowski, a mother of two had appeared while catwalking using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly into tents camps on the Texas border.
Although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of detained migrant children also increased in part, as the harsh language and policies presented by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are self-documenting immigrants and are afraid to risk their own ability to sustain themselves in that country when they come forward to adopt a child.
In June, when the federal authority announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints, and that the data would be handed over to immigration authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress, in which he said the agency had arrested some people who had applied to sponsor minors who were not accompanying them.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or are household members of sponsors remain illegal, and a large part of them are involved in criminal acts.
"We have already started working with these people," he said.
In order to speed up the process of children, authorities have introduced new rules, according to Shelter Workers, some of them will have to appear in court in a month, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, since they were detained.
Many will be present via video conferencing instead of appearing in person to present their pleas for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are unable to help will be expelled from the country immediately.
According to reports from Shelter Workers and systems in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more anxious or desperate they may become, leading to violent tendencies or trying to escape.
Lawyers say that those problems grow larger in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to the large number of children there, children who are being neglected are found to be extremely struggling.
He further said that the children who are being taken to Tent City are facing additional trauma as they are not given time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends.
Syria has asked the US, French and Turkey to immediately leave the country with a "widespread military force".
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mauleem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even though the country's war has now reached its eighth year.
Mulaym, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the foreign military presence on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism is illegal, and that "it will be treated fairly."
"They should immediately come out of the country and there should be no conditions for it," he said.
He stressed that Syria's "war on terror is almost over", which has killed 360,000 people since 2011, and left millions homeless.
He said that "all Syrian terrorists of the terrorist group and "will continue to fight this holy war in Damascus until any foreign entity is cleared".
There are more than 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arabs who oppose Kurdish forces and President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 French troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the question of asylum seekers, Moulem said the conditions were conducive for them to return, but blamed "some foreign countries" for "spreading irrational fears," which led to the refugees staying away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should have been purely humane, they are doing politics."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria unless a political deal is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN Diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has given journalists an opportunity ahead of the political crisis.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale attack on the territory by the Syrian army, which is backed by Russia, where three million people live.
However, Mulaym stressed that there was a "clearly set deadline" for the deal, and hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, and that they would be uprooted with the roots.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee formed by members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections will take place soon.
Moulaymani put forward conditions for the Syrian government's inclusion in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to a review of the current constitution's rules and warned against any interference.
Trump will win the second round.
According to that argument, as many liberals would likely hope that impeachment and an unpleasant event would put an end to his presidency prematurely, but if not, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020.
There is no doubt that "the most dramatic presidential battle ever to be fought will be the last!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's prime-time ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nelson, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, a number that has risen from 1.7 million four years ago, and topped MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" cable ratings, which saw 3.5 million viewers on Major News Nights.
“This is a fire to which people are being dragged, because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Bayer, director of ABC drama “Desegrated Survivor.” The drama was about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Neal Scoville, a famous comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: and Fu Hard Truths About Snitching Into the Hollywood Boys", had a different theory.
She recalls a cab trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because she makes me laugh," Ms. Scovel told me.
There is value in the entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the plot coming from Washington will determine the future of Raw Valley. Mad, what immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
It's a great thing to be ignored, which can only be paid to an audience with privileges.
And yet, it goes over its head even as it's a scholarly citizen, when you look at a panel of experts arguing at six o'clock, which includes Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for his "Fear" book, Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar Austrich-Leeder Bomber Jacket (with a thick coat with a hat).
I'm never going to see Super Mario again.
"Brant Montego Mary, Chief Executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pon Stars," said about the changing cast of Trump's show and the twists in the daily story (by praising Kim Jong Un and arguing with the NFL), "I think part of what they do is provide something every night through a reality show."

When I arrived at Mr. Flees' house this week, outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, there was a nice sunlight and a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius, but he recorded CNN and drove himself to watch MSNBC.
They could not distance themselves from him, not from Brett Kavanaugh, who is ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is in jeopardy.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs during the day and people were saying, 'Western culture has started to come to an end,'" Mr. Flies told me.
"I thought it was funny, but it was true."
Ami Chozhik, a writer who writes extensively on the business, politics, and media of the Times, is the author of the memoir "Chasing Hillary."
The mid-term elections are full of money in the running of the House.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of money, which is responsible for the reorganization of the congressional districts leading to two candidates standing in the race for the same seat.
It recently retook Democratic Republican Connor Lamb in the suburban Pittsburgh district – who won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stood in front of the second candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who was currently representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which was heavily occupied with the new 17 diameter.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally made in favor of Republicans, the maps were reworked.
The race for the new 17th began with a campaign of economic struggle between the main party's economic side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a small margin of victory in the special election in March, which was widely seen for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
The Patriots had a little bit of a game yesterday.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador in support of China, then changed the decision
Diplomats noted that after a slight withdrawal from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his Trump Organization Management Team partner was ousted.
State Department officials recalled U.S. Chief of Diplomatic Missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on a recent decision not to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department earlier this month.
But the only consideration was the imposition of sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including controls on drugs, development and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hurt the country in Central America, as the country has a large number of unemployed and murdered.
As the internal meeting moved forward, North American and Central American officials pushed forward a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar summit last year, which was seen as a step in an effort to prevent immigrants coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration made it clear that it wanted the council to go ahead and effectively end the idea of any penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, which is now set to convene in mid-October and at that conference, the diplomats said.
And without any new harsh messages or punishment from Washington, all three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to one Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to give details of the discussion, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal discussions on terms of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst, who was close to the administration and, as such, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next untold incident could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's potential obstruction of justice, which is now very substantial evidence in public records.
According to the report, Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether there is a conspiracy behind Mr. Trump's campaign, including Russia, in his attack on his election.
If Congress changes its side, Mr. Trump will see himself facing accountability in the institution when he is ready to go to the polls again, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his counterparts.
There are a lot of them, and I don’t mean that Mr. Trump’s defeat is inevitable – or that his counterpart’s defeat in Europe is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices that will affect how long the conflict can go on.
In 1938, if the West had opposed Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, German officials were ready to shift power against Hitler.
We did not succeed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed in the coming year.
The study of history focused on the inevitability of issues of such disagreements, and the continued march of democracy was accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is currently grappling with some of these issues.
What would you do if Mr. Trump removed Deputy Chairman General Rod Rosenstein, who was handling Mr. Mueller’s inquiry?
Ever since the newspaper reported that last year, Rosenstein has been in trouble since he secretly recorded the president and gave the idea that he was not fit for office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times account is incorrect.
How would we react if Brett Kavanaugh's new FBI investigation is not complete or fair - or if he has decided to be extradited to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonesty?
Moreover, we will hold the midterm elections for Congress and will Mr. Trump be held responsible for this?
If we fail to do so, democracy will be dead for a long time.
But I trust that you will not fail, for I have taken a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, so she had to migrate to Auschwitz because of the Nazis who once occupied my embassy.
But she survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she pushed me to set the Sabath candle on the same table with a swastika symbol.
This is my story, so why am I not positive about the future?

Rapid Vienna was organized by Rangers on Thursday.
They feel that the draw with Villarreal in Spain later this month after Austria's victory will be a tough one for them to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
However, due to a knee injury, Graham Dorans could not make a strong start to the season, but with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, Rangers should look at the match as the start of another brilliant performance.
The 31-year-old said: "It was a good game for us because Villarreal is a strong team.
We started the game thinking we could do better and get points.
"In the end, we could have done it, but in the end, the match was often a reasonable decision.
Maybe it was good in the first half and we came in the second half and got up.
It's Thursday night, and it's another big day in Europe.
"Hopefully we get three points but it will be difficult to play because even though their points are good in the last match, I am sure with the support of the people who are with us, we will definitely get positive results.
"Last year was really tough, in all respects, injuries and changes in the club, but this place is still a good thing.
The team is good and the kids are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Fortunately, we can try to do this now, leave the past behind and be successful."
The fear of retirement has made women sleepier
Despite having a clear idea of how to take care of the participants in the survey, some people were talking to their family members.
In a nationwide study, nearly half of people said they were talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 per cent of the respondents spoke about it.
“People want their family members to take care of them, but they are not taking any steps to communicate,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Start from here.
Talk to your spouse and children about this: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Consult with your counselor about where and how to take care of yourself and talk to your family, so that the choice of these things can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Talk to your financial advisor: An advisor can show you how to pay for these expenses.
Your fund choices for long-term monitoring may include a traditional long-term monitoring insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or insuring yourself with your own assets.
Take away your legal documents: Complete legal matters ahead of time.
Get a health-care proxy so that you can hire a trusted person to look after your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your financial matters.
You have to choose a reliable person for you, and if you are disabled, make sure your bills are paid.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and they want to be treated in the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about health and safety?
Write down all the details so that you are ready.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding the death toll is expected to rise.
As a result of the contact shock, relief officials could not get any information from the Dongla Regency, which comes to the northern part of Palu, which is at the center of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In the aftermath of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were shifted to other places in Palu.
The important facts at Palu and Dongla on Sulawesi Island are as follows:
Palau is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongla is a regency stretching 300 km (180 mi) from the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency, which comes under the administrative region, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in this region, but are increasingly concentrated in Morovali, which is on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster relief agency, the Palu and Dongala tsunamis have struck several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the West Dongle, killing nine people.
Indonesia is situated on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: On December 26, 2004, a massive earthquake struck 14 countries off the west coast of Ache Province in north Sumatra, Indonesia, killing 226,000 people, half of whom were in Ache.
2005 - A powerful earthquake strikes the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami struck the south coast of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Mentawaibet, Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: PD Jaya Regency in Aceh is hit by a shallow earthquake that destroyed a lot of things and created an atmosphere of fear, whose devastation reminds people of the terrible earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No deaths were reported, but more than 100 people were injured as a result of the fire.
2018 - Indonesia's tourism island of Lombok is hit by a major earthquake, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for some time.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by Alaska state officials, Palin, 29, from Vasla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and on charges of interfering with domestic violence reports and opposing arrests.
According to the police report, when a woman's family tried to call the police to report the crime, he took away the phone from her.
Palin is being remanded to the Mart-su pretrial facility and placed on a $500 bail letter, KTUU reported.
In a report to the media, he was produced in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked.
Palin faces a third-degree felony, which could lead to up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a second-degree crime, in which he was sentenced to one day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
It is not for the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, had called the police to report the attack.
The case is at present pending in the court of the Supreme Court of India.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence, and drug abuse.
A friend of his told him that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans after she linked her son to violent PTSD, which originated from service in Iraq in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake: Tsunami kills hundreds
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami, and thousands of homes were destroyed.
Power and water supply will be cut off in the coming days and the death toll is expected to rise.
The epicentre of the earthquake is located in central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
The video of the incident is going viral on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach in Palamu city to celebrate when a tsunami hit the coast.
Suspected New York terror attack: Criminal prosecutor calls for death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York have been demanding the death penalty for Syyflo Cypov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people - since 1953 the state government has not given such harsh punishments for federal crimes.
The 30-year-old used a rented home depot truck to attack two-wheelers on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to qualify for the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Cypov killed eight of those people "for the purpose" and caused "for the purpose" of inflicting serious bodily injury.
According to court documents, death penalty can be held to be admissible in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury had charged the 22-year-old accused, Cypov, with eight charges of murder with the help of racketeering, which were generally charged with the destruction of federal prosecutors and motor vehicles in organized crime cases.
Describing what Cypov did as ‘inhuman, cruel and degrading’, the lawyer said the attack required ‘significant planning and premeditation’.
"Seflo Habibulvevic Cypov's injury to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lore Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlis, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pagano."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York has spent a decade running the death penalty case.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were sentenced to death in a New York federal court was two years ago on charges of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple were killed by an electric chair.
According to court documents, Cypov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse during the days of the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge sheet, Cypov told investigators that he was inspired to attack after watching a video of the same on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also been asked to keep the flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the alleged 22-page charge sheet.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, said he was "completely disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We feel that the death penalty should be fixed, accepting any demand for life imprisonment is to increase the suffering of all those involved in this incident," Patton said.
Cypov's defence team had earlier asked prosecutors not to award the death penalty.
Tory has said that Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
During the Tory Council protests, Nigel Farage took an oath to establish an "Organization of the People's Army."
The former U.K. leader said politicians should have a look at Eurosceptics - as suggested by Theresa May's MP, they should have a negotiating table with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told a crowd in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have 'got out of this' by now.
However, the protests against Brexit by supporters of Remen Torres in the city have more clearly revealed the obstacles she faces in the split between Ms May's group.
Even in the midst of the storm of criticism from Brexiters, Republicans and the EU, they are struggling to keep up with plans to keep their checkers promise.
The Allies say that despite the opposition, they should try to establish relations with Brussels and put pressure on Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose one from the plans they have put forward, or "obscenity."
Mr. Bone made it clear before the Leave Mines Leave Rally in Solihal that he wanted to 'end his relationship with the Chequers'.
He also suggested that Mr. Faraaz should have accompanied him and given him the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
If they had, we would have been out by now," he said.
The Wellingboro MP said: “I will stand on the side of Brexit, but we must get the checkers out.”
Regarding his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not participate in World War II to get a second place."
We need laws in our country.
Denying that the referendum had changed since the 2016 election, Mr. Bonn said: “It is wrong that the British people have changed their minds, their demands, and now they want to remain in this system.”
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkins was also present at the front. Speaking to reporters, she said: "All I will say is: PM, listen to the people.
There is anger among the general public about the checkers, the opposition will not vote for them, in our party and in our workers who have chosen us for the highest position, there is an atmosphere of opposition against the checkers.
Please, please, leave the checkers and start listening to the opinions of others.
In a clear message to Smt. May, she said: 'Only when the Prime Minister keeps his promises, he can hold his office.
Addressing the rally, Mr Faraaz said that politicians who want to betray the 2016 referendum should be aware of this.
This has become a matter of trust between our people and our political class.
They are looking to betray Brexit and we want to tell them, at this moment, that we will not let you do this.
Addressing a gathering of enthusiastic people here, he said: "I think you should teach this lesson to our politicians who want to betray Brexit."
“We’re building an army of people in this country, this army that will make us victorious in Brexit, and this army will not sit healthy unless we become a free, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, Remeners took a two-hour march to Birmingham before leaving for the city centre.
A group of activists set up a group to mark the anniversary of the Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, who is considered a friend of the Labour Party, took the Conservative Party on the edge of safety issues contained in the party's app as the conference began.
These are the same people who tell us that the IT system is running smoothly and all this technology will make Canada Plus, there will be peace on the border, there will be free trade without the border of Ireland, and many such things they say," he said.
This is all made up.
There is no such thing as a fair Brexit,” he added.
Warren will be seriously considering contesting the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, Massachusetts Democrats were talking about their future plans during a townhall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been a constant critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Goff DL, who was also co-chair of Goff Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He is expected to face Trump in the 2020 election.
After Trump took office on Saturday, it was the 36th meeting with voters in the city hall.
A member of the audience asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington to prove our disgruntled government, and that means having the highest-ranking women."
One arrested for murder of LSU sims
LA police announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of basketball player Wyde Sims of the LSU has been arrested.
The Batten Rouge Police Department said that Detton Simpson, 20, was arrested at the ET news conference at 11 a.m.
Police have released a video of the incident and asked people to identify the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the University of Southern California campus on Friday morning.
"Wide Sims was shot in the head and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media.
Vide fell into his friend's arms to save him and Simpson shot him.
During police interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was on the spot at the time, that he had a gun and that he had fired at the Wyde Sims.
Simpson was easily arrested by the police and has been detained at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot 6-inch junior basketball player grew up at Sims Baton Rouge. He has played 32 matches so far, with 10 of them starting in the last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the World Cup by defeating Sebastian Vettel on the order of the team
It was only when Valtteri Bottas qualified for the tournament with more points than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that it became clear that the Mercedes team's order would now be important.
Bottas had a good start from the pole, taking Hamilton's place on the first two turns, and it was time for Vettel to beat his own teammate.
Hamilton was left in traffic at the end of the pack before Vettel moved to Pitts. In fact, this action should have been decisive.
Mercedes then again won the back seat of Vettel, but after a few more interesting moments, Hamilton moved on and Ferrari's driver had to reluctantly open the inside to take a double-mouth risk for the third place.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and reached seventh position by the end of the first leg of the tournament, which was painted on his 21st birthday.
He then went on to complete the race, grabbing most of the next part of the competition on his car, surpassing Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally reached Pitts in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his pace as Ryconen finished fourth.
It was a really tough day. Valtteri did a great job and he is very good.
The team has done a great job in winning the toss, Hamilton said.
This is a really bad statement
US Senator Diane Fensten has denied allegations of sexual harassment by US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, claiming that he did not bring out Fords letter to her.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president directly cited Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, noting that what's going on in the Senate shows how "selfish, irritable, and falsifying" people have become."
"What's been going on in the Senate for the past few days, what's going on there... when you see anger there, you see people who are angry, bitter, selfish and liars."
"You look at the publicity papers, she leaks and then says... oh... I didn't."
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
"Dude, did you do that?
Remember the answer... Did you leak these documents... "What, what did you say?"
Oh, no.
I didn't lock it."
Yeah, hold on a minute.
Why did we leak it... No, we didn't do it," the president made the statement in the style of a senator.
Ford had sent a letter to Feinstein in July and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein has denied that the letter was leaked from his office.
I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, but I have not leaked his letter," Feinstein told the committee.
They asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as it was.
However, his refusal did not interest the president much, and he said at a Saturday night meeting: "I tell you, this is very bad behavior."
They may not have done it, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen."
Appearing for the Supreme Court representative, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said these Democrats are using these allegations to their advantage.
They need to do something to regain power.
You see the selfishness, the hypocrisy, the pain of someone who is hurting them, they don't even want to see who they are crushing to gain power and dominance," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars returned to the elite league on Friday with a 5-3 win over Belfast Giants in their return match.
With Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier scoring goals early in the match, the Giants quickly gained the lead of two goals.
Before Dwyer gave the Giants a lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Couny equalised for the hosts.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized Dundee and then Lucas Lundwald Nielson's goal led the team to victory.
This was Adam Kief's third defeat in the Elite League this season, before he was trailing behind Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35th minute, four minutes before the start of the game, with Kendall McFaul's help. Four minutes later, David Rutherford's help helped Bouvier double the lead.
The opening minutes of the match were filled with action. Sullivan continued the challenge with a goal in the 13:10th minute, followed by a goal by Matt Markardet in the 15:16th minute.
At the end of the first session, Dwyer scored his second goal to give the Giants a lead in the first break.
"Jaiman scored again and in the 27:37 minute, Boukard scored a power play goal to bring the team back into the fold."
Couny and Charles Corkeran came together to help Nelson score, and Dundee got the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second season. He secured the team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the final session of the match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, will now play their next match on Friday against Milton Keynes at their home ground.
Air traffic controller killed in earthquake, rescues hundreds of passengers
The Indonesian Air Force (IAF) has confirmed that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers has taken off safely.
At least 800 people were killed and several others missing after a powerful earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The entire area has been destroyed by strong earthquake tremors and many people have been trapped under the debris in the city of Palu.
The control of the Muttiyara Sis Al Zufri airport in Palu was shaken by the Manorara earthquake. The 21-year-old Athanius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position even though the other colleagues left the arena in fear of his life.
At that time, Batik Air Flight 6321 was on the runway, so he did not move from his position to be able to fly safely.
He then jumped out of the vehicle when he realised that traffic control was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
The decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirat told ABC News.
We had arranged a helicopter at Balikappan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were shocked to hear this,” he said.
Meanwhile, the administration fears that the death toll could reach thousands, and emergency management agencies say it is difficult to reach all parts of the cities of Dongla, Singi and Boutong.
"The death toll is likely to rise further, as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and we have not been able to reach them," the agency spokesman said.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated the city of Palu. Mass burials will be held in the city of Palu on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing assistance and essential supplies.
"Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: "The autopsy is coming every minute.
Clean water has become scarce.
Small markets are being looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors but we don't know what they will have to do to get there."
This is a very sad situation already, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I'm asking you all to work day and night to complete everything related to the deportation.
Are you ready?" the BBC reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niyugini is now saying that a man is missing after the plane crashed in the Gulf.
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed in the Gulf of Micronesia, now says one passenger is missing after the crash, with 47 passengers and crew on board the sinking plane safely evacuated.
In a press release, Air Niyugini said that the company did not find a male passenger until Saturday afternoon.
"We are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigating agencies to find the man.
When asked for more details such as the age or nationality of the passenger, the airline did not immediately respond.
When the plane was trying to land at the airport on the wrong island, local people helped the passengers and staff to escape after it fell into the water.
Seven people have been taken to the hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six of the passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are stable, the airline said.
The exact cause of the crash is yet to be ascertained.
The airline and the US Navy said the aircraft had landed before reaching the runway.
Some observers believe that the plane went beyond the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jensen said the plane was too low.
Jones said: "It was a good thing.
Jenis said he and other passengers got out of the sinking plane by way of an emergency exit and walked through the water across the waist.
He said that the staff of the aircraft were frightened and shouting and also stated that they had received minor injuries on their heads.
The U.S. Navy said a few sailors were involved in the rescue effort, taking the crew to shore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank. The plane then sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to the aviation safety network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the past two years, but not a single aircraft of Air Niyugini was involved.
Analysts said the woman was burnt alive that night.
On Saturday, the government party completed its arguments in a man's case against a woman accused of burning alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The 19-year-old told the jury how she checked cellphone records to find out what exactly happened between her and the 29-year-old accused Quinton Teles the night Jessica Chambers died.
He collected and examined location data of several cellphones to make sure that Teles was with her on the evening on which Chambers died, said Rolett, who had previously claimed that he was not with her that evening.
According to available data, his cellphone appears to have been near the Chambers cellphone at the time, and Teles said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time. Police then went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
He said his truck was in Nashville at the time, when he was asked by a public prosecutor about what he claimed was happening in a truck in Sanford that night.
Another difference is that she had known him for two weeks before Chambers died.
From the records of the cellphones, it appears that they had started getting to know each other only a week ago.
At some point after Chambers's death, Teles deleted all her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone, Rowlett said.
"He took her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The case is expected to go before the court on the same day, the judge said.
The High Breed: What is the Concilius Hip Hop?
Hip Hop Trio wants to challenge the negative view of this genre of music, filling it with positive messages.
High Breed in Bristol has claimed that hip-hop is full of its political message as well as the underlying purpose of handling social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and give back to the Concise Hip Hop community.
Artists from groups such as the Fujis and the Common have seen a surge in the UK through the arts such as the Akalis and the Gooki.
There's another black person.
A couple in New York drags a couple to court for being cut from work on the basis of a "racist" message
"She is being dragged to court in New York for allegedly dismissing a New York-based couple after her mother mistakenly sent her a message that she was ""another black person""."
The couple has denied the charge of apartheid, claiming that the case is of a “broken” nature.
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, said she was disappointed when she first noticed that the baby was black when she came to work in 2016 to take care of the baby.
"Nassssssssssssssssssssssssssssss is another black one," wrote Plassico-Flaxman to send a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending the message to the husband, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Morris, even twice.
After noticing this confusion, the ‘missing’ Pawsko-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris from her job, who was an African-American, and was doing a bad job. So we now want a Filipino nanny, she told the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work and was later sent home by Uber.
Now, Ms. Morris is pushing the couple to court for a pay cut, demanding $350 a day for a six-month period, including a full-time stay.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the newspaper on Friday. "I know, it's racism," she said.
The concerned couple has denied the claim that they were racists. It is no longer possible to disbelieve Mrs. Morris because she was hurt. In such a situation, it is only logical to dismiss them.
"My wife sent them what she didn't want to say."
It's not racist.
"We're not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But, when you have done this, will you deliver the children into the hands of the same man, after that you have dealt with them unjustly? And if you have done this to them in error?"
Are you going to give your child that?
Its not possible.
Plasco said the case was of a "broken" type, saying that his wife had given birth to the baby two months ago and that she was currently in "extremely difficult circumstances."
"Does anyone follow someone like that?"
“It’s not a very good thing,” said Plasco, an investment banker.
Though the court case is still going on, the court of public opinion has issued a statement on social media criticising the couple's behaviour and their reasoning.
The publisher of Paddington was worried that readers would not be able to accept the idea of the bear, a new letter has revealed.
Karen Yankel, Bond’s daughter who was born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to understand who will be reading it for the first time before the book is published.”
It's interesting to know what we know about the great success of Paddington now."
After working as a cameraman in the BBC, the father of a small toy bear, who wrote books for children, would have been optimistic even if the book was rejected, she says, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of this book has been 'combined' with his death last year.
Paddington described her as "a very important member of our family", adding that her father was very proud of the success she had finally achieved.
“They were very calm. They never wanted to play their own timki,” she said.
“But Paddington was a real presence for them, that is, if your son achieves some success, it’s something we’re really proud of, even if it’s not ours.
I think that's the way they look at Paddington's success.
It was his creation and his imagination, yet he always attributed it to Paddington."
My daughter was on her last lap and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Lou Pasteur to hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her but it was in vain.
"Nad was calling me regularly and telling me that the situation is very bad. I don't think she'll come out of it," said Mr. Ednan-Laprauz.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said he was going to die in the next two minutes and I wanted to say goodbye to her.
And I cleaned her up.
I said, "I love you, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The effect of the drugs given by the doctors to continue pumping her heart was gradually decreasing and all her systems were shut down.
He died a short time ago and everything was gone.
I just wanted to sit back and wait and see what was going on.
I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because there were so many families and people around me.
I really had to save myself."
Eventually, hundreds of Ednan-Laperaus boarded the plane with other passengers mourning the loss of their daughter. They had no idea what the goddess was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I was sitting on the floor and my eyes were constantly watering.
It's a little hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt sympathy for Nad.
He needed to know my love.
I knew how much she loved him."
Women in distress post cards to prevent suicides from happening across the bridge.
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are now working to prevent the rest of the world from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge. People can get help by calling these phone numbers.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, had been suffering from depression since she was 13 and ended her life at the age of 18.
"I don't think any parent has the time to enjoy what I'm going through every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lidney. Her son was an up-and-coming chef with a smile on his face.
“Everyone knew him for his honesty.
He always had a smile on his face."
He had quit his job before he died, because he was "living in the dark for a very long time."
Tyler committed suicide in 2014 when his 11-year-old brother saw him dead.
Mrs. David said: "I'm kind of worried that it's going to have an indirect impact on her."
Mrs. David created the cards, “To make these people aware that there are people you can go to, people you can talk to, they can be any of your friends.
“Don’t be silent – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years. Mrs. Humphreys lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
"He never said he was disappointed, he never said anything," she said.
"In the last couple of months, we've seen a change in our attitude.
He didn't have any money in his pocket on Christmas day - when the children were opening their presents, he avoided staring at them."
She said her death was a huge shock to her family, but we got out of it. "It created a gap in the family.
This has divided us.
All we have to do is keep going and keep going."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is a bit off as the FBI has launched an investigation
"I thought, if we really got something like what he's asking for - an investigation that's going to be completed in a certain period of time, a limited opportunity - then maybe we could bring in a little bit of unity," said Mr. Fleck Saturday, adding that he feared he was "disrupted" by the committee's gridlock habits.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It is only because of their time.
There are only six weeks left for the midterm elections, which are on November 6 - if the Republicans' performance goes bad as expected, their attempt to send an elected man to the country's highest court will be very weak.
George W. Bushney picked up the phone to call the Senator to build a row of supporters supporting Mr. Kavanaugh. Mr. Kavanaugh was working for Mr. Bush at the White House and it was through him that Mr. Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, when Ashley was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen to the FBI report?
Fifty-one Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote in the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, vice president, to equalize and retain him in the Supreme Court.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's government has "reduced" the number of people in the country
South Korean lawmakers say the number of North Koreans entering South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Referring to data from the South Unification Ministry, Park Byong-sung said there were 1,227 infiltrators last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border control between North Korea and China and overcrowding from human traffickers was an important factor.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that at the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border.
Many people in China, which has a large border with North Korea, find it easier to cross the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the infiltrators as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and sends them back forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - even though technically war is on - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss non-use of nuclear power.
This came after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore in June to discuss a broad range of issues on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho slammed US sanctions over the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we will not be able to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "babeful" and says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-directed candidate Brett Kavanaugh "babeful" and said he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court for some time.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I can't do anything about it but it seems that if a woman did this, they would call her 'babuhan'," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
Kavanaugh became very brother-in-law when he started talking, talking about his family and his high school days.
He accused Democrats of a "coordinated murder of a strange and character" in an attempt to express his anger at Hillary Clinton's 2016 election defeat.
Pelosi has stated that Kavanaugh's evidence proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as he proves that he is biased in the case of a Democrat.
"I think he has disqualified himself by his statements and by following Clinton and the Democrats,"" she said."
If Kavanaugh was appointed and won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi appeared reluctant when asked if she would question his legitimacy.
"All I'm going to say is -- they're not going to tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not going to be right in the Supreme Court, they're not going to be right now," Pelosi said.
Kawanog is presently a Judge in the Appellate Circuit Court of D.C.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade handling a potential claim against her, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh dropped some of the Supreme Court's rulings on whether he would appeal.
"This is not the time to expect an unintelligent, biased man to go to court and hear from you, "Wow, that's great!", Pelosi said.
Women need to use their weapons.
This right voice has been raised, months and years have passed and she had no choice but to cry.
"When we get angry, we cry," Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think this is normal, what do you think?"
She added, "I was very supported by a woman who worked as an executive somewhere, she said that she was very angry that she was also crying, but she developed a technique that when she started crying and crying, she used to say to the man who was talking, 'Think that I'm crying because I'm sad.
I got angry."
And then he continued.
And I thought it was incredible."
Tears are allowed as a low point of anger because there are basic misconceptions about them.
One of the strongest memories I had about my early job was, in a male-dominated office, where I once saw an elderly woman, crying in anger, holding my neck - a cold-blooded manager who was always afraid of me - and dragging it to the wall of the Jin.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said.
They didn't know you were angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy for that.”
Patricia Schroeder, a woman from the Democratic Congress in Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat named Monkey Business, Mrs. Schroeder became very frustrated and wondered why she would not stand for the presidential election herself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she said laughing at me after 30 years.
"There are already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they want is another candidate.
Some have called it "Snowwhite and the Seven Dwarfs."
"They were reluctant to raise the funds because of the delay and therefore determined that they would not enter the fight until they received $2 million."
It was a losing battle.
She told me that she was going to pay $1000 to her husband.
"Do they think I'm relaxed?" she thought to herself.
They were so overwhelmed with emotion when they announced that they would not launch a formal campaign - thanks to the people who support them, an outcry about the system that makes it difficult to raise money, and anger over representation and sexuality instead of targeting voters.
"You might have thought I was heartbroken," Ms Schroeder said about the feedback given to her by the newspapers.
"You might have thought that Clint was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what he's going to write about in my book?
"Why did she cry?"""
How the U.S. and China can benefit from the trade war
Experts say the trade war between the U.S. and China, with no sign of an end to the war, could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump has issued a first warning by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week there has been a massive increase in new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods coming from China, effectively taxing all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has resisted every time by levitating between five and 10 per cent of its imports, compared to the most recent 60 billion dollars in US goods.
China has vowed to follow in the footsteps of the US and soon the world's largest economy will never be forgotten.
Withdrawing Washington would mean meeting the demands, but publicly greeting the US would be very disturbing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game properly, China can provide positive long-term support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies due to pressure from the US trade war.
In fact, the economic turmoil that will start in one of the two countries if immediate political decisions are made in Washington or Beijing is far more dangerous than what people have previously accepted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think-tank.
Syria's foreign minister says he is "ready" to return to Syria.
Syria is ready to voluntarily return the refugees and has sought help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today's progress in combating terrorism has made the situation in our region more stable and secure," he said.
In order to improve the general situation, the government has started rehabilitating the areas destroyed by terrorists.
Now all the conditions are ready to voluntarily return the refugees who had to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulayem said the Syrian government would help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from armed aiding countries.
Europe's first Ryder Cup to be held in Paris
The 2018 Ryder Cup was won by the United States at Le Golf National, outside of Paris, France, with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has lost six times in a row in European countries and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Denmark captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn's team won the European crown with a score of 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled in a number of competitions, taking his T-Shots to the par-16s and putting Francesco Molinari in the water.
Italian golfer Molinari became the first of four players to shine in all of his competitions and took a 5-0 lead in the tournament since it began in 1979.
Denmark's Thorbourne Olsen was knocked out of the European Championship by American player Jordan Spieth by a margin of 5-4 points.
The world's top-ranked batsman, Dustin Johnson, fell behind England's Ian Poulter 2-1, who may have played for the final Ryder Cup.
Experienced in eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but there's nothing I can do today.
This is a tough year.
Thank you for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy that I’m able to help,” said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his countrymate John Raham, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles game on Sunday.
The 23-year-old said: "I'm incredibly proud of the person I grew up with, defeating Tiger Woods.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
"One of the greatest players of all time, Jack Nicklaus has won only 14 major titles.
With the exception of high-capacity golf players Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, USA teams travelled all Saturday and Sunday to find Fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk made a statement about his team's disappointing performance, saying, "I am proud of these people, they fought.
This morning, we tried to put pressure on the European Union.
We fought hard.
Salutations to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 players played well.
"We will re-match the team, I will work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and we will move on.
I love these guys and I am proud to be a captain.
You have to praise them.
We got out.
Red Tide Update: Concentration of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarsota drops significantly
According to the latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there has been a general decline in red-tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy bloom conditions are being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarsota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which reduces concentrations.
The Red Tide has extended its 130-mile coastline from North Pinlas to Southern Lee County.
