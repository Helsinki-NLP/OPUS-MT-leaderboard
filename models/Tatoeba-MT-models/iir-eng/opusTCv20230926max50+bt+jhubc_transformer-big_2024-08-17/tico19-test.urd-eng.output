The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK increased sharply between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the EU/EEA and the UK is showing similar trends, while the COVID-19 pandemic in all countries is accelerating at different stages depending on the country.
Based on Italy's experience, hospitals and intensive care units in many countries should increase their preparedness thanks to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they will need intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of pneumonia cases of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause agent is the novel coronavirus, now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while in 6% of cases, those experiencing severe illness need intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is ca.4%.
In this study, we will evaluate trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/EURI Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the UK (UK) and compare them to Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19, and the dynamic state of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently in line with the same country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Secretary et al reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO's case definition.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA, reported on January 24, 2020 by three French people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths occurred in Italy alone.
To achieve the total number of COVID-19 cases and the overall spread.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) receives data on COVID-19 cases in every country around the world from official sources only, the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
The data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with Italy.
As for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day-dose overall spread of COVID-19, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We compared the total number of reported cases of each country from January 31 to March 15, 2020, to 8 a.m. on March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in the EU/EEA Countries and the UK
In general, the 14-day-dotted total spread of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK has been consistent with the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then accelerated to February 28, 2020 (additional material).
This was mostly due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has been shown to be similarly increasing trends(containing material).
In Figure 2, the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared with Italy during the period January 31 to March 15, 2020 has been shown.
It was highlighted that, as of March 15, 8:00 a.m., just before or less than 3 weeks ago, the total number of cases in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK were previously reported, compared to Italy.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 show that the global pandemic is accelerating at a pace comparable to all countries.
Despite the countries being at different stages, variations in the national public health response and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for patient selection that require testing to confirm COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10 percent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on the admissions of COVID-19 cases to any hospital and/or intensive care unit for 6% and 1% of cases at EU/EEA levels, respectively, are available (data is not shown).
However, recent surveillance data, including the completion of reported cases and the number of deaths, should be collected in an orderly manner.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there was a major shift in the availability of intensive care and mid-career beds from 29.2 beds in Germany to 29.2 in Europe and 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that these countries will have fewer and fewer resources like Italy (12.5 intensive care and mid-career beds for every 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios related to the increase in healthcare capacity, estimates of COVID-19 hospitalization cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK that are associated with a <0x3E>90% risk of exceeding the capacity of the intensive care bed, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid concern assessment of the ECDC on COVID-19.
Since so far there have been clusters of cases in EU/EEA countries and specific areas in the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units in general describe the population of the region, priority data on cases and intensive care beds facilitates available numerology of available regional units of 2 (NUTS-2).
The situation in Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must prepare themselves for a permanent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the surge in COVID-19 patients, like in Italy's affected areas, requires health care, especially intensive care.
As in the recent ECDC rapid concern assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach has been identified as necessary to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which should be accompanied by a change in the containment approach, if not implemented ahead of time, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases could not provide time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand and accept their response accordingly.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
Here's a small opportunity during which countries are likely to step up their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare providers.
Failure to do so, it is likely that healthcare systems in EU/EEA countries will face the need for intensive care in the coming days or weeks due to an increase in patients.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has so far killed more than 3,000 and infected more than 80,000 people in China and anywhere in the world, resulting in devastating to humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS-CoV in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, but it affects older people and women more than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about emerging disease, this article attempts to offer a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing research article.
We will cover the basics about epidemics, virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will be helpful in understanding and eliminating this dangerous disease.
The spring festival of 25 January 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese residents due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, all holidays and the urge to stay at home for several weeks.
The virus is highly homologous with coronavirus (CoV), which led to the outbreak of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease associated with it is named COVID-19.
The outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread to about 50 other countries across the country and around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number 1 enemy of the people" and that it is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), COVID-19 in less than two months, which includes its virology, pathology, causes, treatment and diagnosis after the first report of January 7, 2020, and which has been determined to isolate multiple patients, has been published in more than 200 journals.
This review attempts to summarize the creative progress in the field of new and rapidly developing topic.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS spread in 2012).
We will also talk about what has been learned so far about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease, as well as some of the other important questions yet to be answered.
For humans, CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens, mainly causing about 15% of the common flue 4.
However, in this century, we have had two of the most deadly CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon the dreaded disease spread to many other countries with its mortality rate.
COVID-19 is the third pandemic in recorded human history.
As shown in figure, figure.1,1, about the pneumonia cluster whose sources are unknown, was first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoVs was released.
The first case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among healthcare workers, which meant it was possible for it to be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, all public transport in the city of Wuhan was shut down and it was shut down.
The first medical study on the disease on January 24 reported that only 21 of the 41 patients in confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is considered the site of the onset of the infection by an unknown source of the animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of the report's arrival, the disease had already spread to nearly 50 countries across China and around the world (Figure.2.2).
As the situation is rapidly deteriorating, the final scope and severity of the epidemic is yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, there were 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, described in a multidisciplinary study as another latest explanation of the epidemic listed (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30.
About half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly to Hubei and surrounding areas.
The average COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 (9-2) days from the start.
The average period of growth was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to the time of mass transportation ahead of the Spring Festival in China, the number of infected people rose sharply before June 23, 2020.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was %1.44 (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was %3.06 (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses, which are part of the synthesis of the RNA of the senses.
They are divided into four generations, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptides 4 (DPP4), respectively, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion.
Viral genetics are released into the cytoplasma, then after the viral genetics are replicated, the genetics combine with RNA to form a version of glycoproteins and new chloroquine, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
More than 99.98 per cent of the 10 samples collected from the original site of the outbreak linked to the Wuhan seafood market found the genetic identity of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more common than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to the transfer of electron microscopy, particles of SARS-CoV-2 have been found on the very thin part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found not only as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more weakly linked to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV causes fewer infections than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form secretory proteins by encoded by orf3b and orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in viral pathogenicity and express itself in IFNB, although there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On February 18, 2020, Zhao et al., along with the amino acid transporter B0AT1, reported complex resolution in the structure of EM in the full length of the human ACE2 in 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> islands.
They found that the complexity, in which open and closed changes were combined as a dimmer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complexity could bind to the two S proteins, which facilitate the identification of CoVs and evidence of infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment for screening drugs in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and the Dalai Lama
It is well known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which originate from bats, have been transmitted to humans through seat cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus accounts for 96% of bats like two SARS-CoVs such as CoVs beta-SL-CoVZX45 and beta-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is not yet known which middleman has helped cross the barriers to infect humans, and the route of transmission is yet to be determined.
G, et al., had suggested snakes as pathogens of the virus from bats to humans, including homologous replication within the S protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested, according to a study, that in traditional Chinese medicine, long-sunnit pangolins, ant-eating mammals, pigolins, and SARS-CoV-2, 99% of the genetic homogeneous genes found in the genome may be potential intermediates of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the %1$ difference of prevalence in the two genomes is still a huge difference, similarly, awaiting the final results of comprehensive evidence(sq.33).
Most of the physiological properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and in the humidity of less than 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 40%-50% can survive up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively inactivated by ultraviolet rays, and by heating up to 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes, or by a disinfectant containing 75% ethanol, chlorine, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fatty acids.
In general, the entire human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore they are susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer to previous studies about other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Chuckle.(4.4.4)).
Usually, when a representative is attacked by a virus, the immune system of this representative is identified through the first type of receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lactane-like receptors, TLRs, NLRs, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through a variety of methods, virus inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of the number I type interferon (IFNs), which restricts the spread of the virus and stimulates its viral antigens to accelerate microphysitoses.
However, SARS-CoV N antibodies can help protect the virus from the immune response.
Soon, the favorable immune response becomes involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including <0x2B>CD4 and <0x2B>CD8, play an important role in cell defense.
T cells of <0x2B>CD4 stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies related to the virus, and T cells of <0x2B>CD8 directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
T-help cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing T cells to ovulate.
Hormones such as C3a and C5a and antibody supplements are essential to combat viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized from the antibody isolated from the recovered patient.
On the other hand, the abuse of the immune system creates many free radicals locally that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, the worst case scenario is many organs stop working and even die.
SARS-CoV-2 infection has been evident since the onset of clustering, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
It is more common in people who have two to four viruses, or who have weak immune functions, than others who are more likely to be infected.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the growth period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, according to a study on 1,099 cases, the average duration of growth is 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study showed that the growth period based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to set an effective quarantine time based on the most appropriate period of growth to protect people from transmission of the virus from people who are infected but have not shown symptoms.
In general, people infected or infected with the virus need to quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
Often the main and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, with no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, knee, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience shortness of breath and/or a stroke a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experience immediate improvement in acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity, and freezing.
Fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even against normal pulmonary imaging, should be tested for early diagnosis of patients.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that 98 percent of patients with fever, 76 percent of dry cough, 55 percent of patients with respiratory failure, and 3 percent of those with symptoms of diarrhea needed ventilation support.
In two recent studies, similar results have been found, regarding the cause of a jaundice, through the transfer from a household to a non-significant individual.
In comparison, a 2012 study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had underlying symptoms of fever (%98), dry cough (%47), and shortness of breath (%55).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients, and MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
MERS patients were also seen with diarrhea (%26) and sore throat (%21).
It has been proven that SARS patients have significant symptoms such as fever (100-99%), dry cough (75-29%), shortness of breath (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and sore throat (25-13%), and about 20-14% of patients need ventilation support.
As of February 14, globally when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576, the death rate for COVID-19 was 2%.
By comparison, as of November 2002, the mortality rate among SARS-verified cases in 8,096 was 10%.
Based on a population study in June 2012, the mortality rate among 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study showed that the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 R0 was higher than the confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 to 6.47 with a confidence interval of 95%, while the reproductive range of SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
This table compares SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with symptoms, mortality and reproductive numbers.
The above data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both later viruses.
Therefore, controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is more difficult than the outbreaks of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Often the jamming begins with a ship of the same family, or a ship of the same gathering or riding.
Most patients have a history of travel or accommodation in Wuhan or other affected areas in the past two weeks before the start, or contact with infected people or patients.
However, it has been reported that people can keep the virus indoors for up to two weeks without showing symptoms, and patients who have recovered from the hospital can be infected again with the virus, which rings a bell to extend the quarantine time.
In these patients, white blood cells were found to be low or equal at the initial level (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L in lymphocytes containing the number of lymphocytes <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and the level and viremia of spret aminotransferases were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
In some patients, there was an increase in the levels of myoglobin in the liver and muscles, and in most patients, there was an increase in C-inactive lymphocyte and atherosclerosis.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer, phosphorus deficiency, was increased, so the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The usual features in the radiography of COVID-19 patients' chests show a two-sided complex shadow or blurring on the ground glass in the lungs.
Most patients develop common pneumonia, severe lung pain, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Inflammation syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, a collection of fluids and growing fibroses are largely compromised in the exchange of gas.
Inactivation of type I and type II pneumocytes reduces the level of the cerebellum and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung spread and their failure.
Therefore, the worst radiographic results of the chest are parallel to the extreme extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients and the first pathological analysis of COVID-19, according to the pathology of ARDS and viral infections, showed the presence of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and multicellular lymphocyte in the lungs of the patient who died of the disease.
The use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was the key criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
On 13 February 2020, in China, due to the high rate of negative false positives, which can accelerate the epidemic, the use of medical data for diagnosis began (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, in the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory testing, and radiological results must all be present.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zheng Group described a protocol for the use of a CRISPR-based shear technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2 devices without the need for 100-hour detection of RNA fragments of artificial SARS-CoV-2 from 20x10-18 microliters/liters to 200x10-18 microliters.
Hopefully, if confirmed in medical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, primarily healers can provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while also attempting various treatment therapies that had previously been suggested or used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table(2).)
These methods of treatment include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovery patients' plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Initially, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly on the lungs, and perhaps other organs expressing small amounts of ACE2, such as the stomach and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and lung failure are the biggest risk factors for the patient and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, to help alleviate symptoms and save lives, general oxygen, high-flow oxygen, non-interference ventilation and mechanical intervention ventilation are included.
Patients with severe pain in the respiratory system have to be assisted by the use of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique for treatment of life-threatening heart attack or respiratory failure, through an ECMO.
Additionally, for the care of electrolyte, the treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septic shock are essential for the protection of vital organ functions in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is said that the excess of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS results in cytokines.
Cytokines are a type of organized inflammatory response that arises from a series of releases of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines are involved in immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that cause severe respiratory distress syndrome and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine strom, especially in severely ill patients.
Corticosteroids and two cesizumab have been used to treat cytokines.
In the treatment of suppression of other immune responses to cytokines strom; IFN-y,IL-1 and TNF were blocked; JAK was blocked; kinetic cell suppression 4; and HADC inhibitors, T cell-directed modification of the immune response.
Steroids were widely used as an immunosuppressant as a treatment to reduce the severity of inflammation damage in SARS.
However, heavy doses of steroids were not beneficial in lung disease in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially affecting the vascular osteonecrosis diagnosis in a dramatic way.
Nevertheless, it has been suggested that patients with severe COVID-19 should use short courses of corticosteroid-infectious doses with caution.
To date, no effective anti-viral treatment has been confirmed.
However, in an American patient with COVID-19 with rheumatoid arthritis, the nucleoid-tide Anna Log was found to be effective.
Remittsvir is a novel antiviral drug, initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, Remittsvere was also designated as a potential blocker for the prevention of other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided China with a mix of its samples for a couple of trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, with results much higher than expected.
In addition, baracetinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/retinoin, and ribavirin have been suggested for possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
In combination with lopinavir/retinovir, the treatment may show diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage, and other adverse reactions.
The combination of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from this infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from this disease or to protect healthy people from this disease.
In fact, most recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin(Ig) that fight pathogens and other external things through B lymphocytes and help to identify unique molecules on the pathogen and to neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and admitted to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms, such as inflammation and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood, improve within 24 hours.
However, the specific treatment has not yet been developed, so it is necessary to confirm and explain it before suggesting its widespread use.
In addition, in addition to seeing the effects of the treatment, some of the harms associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies increase immune response, and can cause cytokines' reward syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening.
In general, the number of antibodies in the blood is low, and there is a high demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients.
It is difficult to develop a specific antibody so quickly to fight against the pandemic.
Separating B cells from recovered patients and identifying genetic codes to encode effective anti-aging is a delicate and difficult process to screen an effective antibody against the virus's essential antibodies.
In this way, we can speed up the process of antibody production.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on traditional Chinese medicine theories.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or ambiguous because it is difficult to extract and confirm such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from the acute stage.
For example, Zhu Fan Jie Lu capsules and Li Huang Cheng Win capsules have been proven to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In several provinces of China, COVID-19 patients, including Gansu, (63.7%) Nanjia (50%), and Hunan (50%), saw a high rate of improvement in the treatment of their patients, using 87% traditional Chinese medicine, while Hubei Province, which used only 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had a lower recovery rate (below 13%).
However, this is a fairly strict comparison, as the effects of this assessment should include many other factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zheng and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine to Western medicine (WM).
They found that in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine group, the recovery of body temperature, symptoms, and duration of stay in hospital, was significantly lower than needed, compared to only the Western Medicine group.
Very impressively, the symptomatic increase (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group only in the WM group (46.2% compared to 7.4%) and the mortality rate (39% compared to 8.8%).
Nevertheless, traditional Chinese medicine still awaits more good and controlled trials of its performance and safety in larger and more concentrated markets.
It would be interesting to highlight the process of treating traditional Chinese medicine, explaining their effective ingredients or their combinations, if possible.
Suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 are most likely to experience extreme infectious and even fear of deadly disease, and quarantine individuals are prone to boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, shock, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatment due to carticosteroids can lead to insomnia, more anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients have been diagnosed with chronic mental stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, depression, and suicide.
Detection and quarantine of contact as part of public health coverage related to the COVID-19 pandemic can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, people who are in contact with them, as well as ordinary people who are in need.
Physical support should include establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, continuous and accurate communication with the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its treatment plans, and to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to prevent transmission from animal enclosures, and infected humans to sensitive representatives, and antiviral treatments are often necessary to control the emerging virus epidemic.
Efforts have been made to develop a long-term and potent neutralizing antibody and/or immunogenicity-based vaccine against SARS.
Vaccines that directly affect animal samples for SARS were analyzed.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting older people, deadly challenge samples, and animal virus infections cannot be determined before clinical studies begin.
This is because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and so far no new cases have been reported.
On the other hand, in areas other than the Middle East where there are permanent sources of animal viruses, the MERS outbreak is continuing.
The MERS vaccine strategy has been developed using virus inactivated, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recovered lymph nodes, and some of them were tested on animal samples.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised people is an urgent and important task to overcome the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome this difficulty due to the long-term (average 18 months) requirement for vaccine development and dynamic mutations of CoVs.
COVID-19 has started showing its clinical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without a trace.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with more disease and deaths in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is important for health care agencies to create a diagnostic model of the disease to prioritize their services in low-resource areas.
Based on medical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or impact of COVID-19 patients (table 33).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also valid for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily occurred in people aged 65-30 years, 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the above-mentioned study were over the age of 50.
Patients who have a higher risk of underlying complications require intensive care, and are older than those who do not have such complications (average age of 66 years instead of 51 years), who treat age as a diagnostic process for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000).
Weaknesses and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory attacks.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to ACE2-positive cholingosite, which can lead to liver damage in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying disease have a strong relationship and can interfere with each other.
Laboratory abnormalities: The C reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible analytical process for the treatment response and final recovery of the disease.
A C-reactive laxative level correlation has been proposed for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, the Elliott Lactate D-hydrogenase (LDH), the Spiroate aminotransferase (AST), the Ellanine aminotransferase (ALT), and the Creatine kinase can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are expressed in a number of organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released through tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional targets of heart or liver damage.
Important medical symptoms: To predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19, the radiography of the chest and the temporary improvement of medical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other tissues.
The use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are commonly used to suppress immunity to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage as an adjuvant treatment in infectious disease.
Since large amounts of carticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors experienced lifelong disability and poor quality of life with avascular osteochondrosis.
Therefore, if necessary, very small amounts of steroids should be used for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental Tumors: As mentioned above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, suffered from abnormal episodes due to prolonged quarantine and observing the illogical death of close family and co-morbidities.
These patients need psychological counseling and long-term support to recover from the trauma and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the epidemiological features of COVID-19 seem to be different from SARS.
In addition to wrapping in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also wrap in the upper respiratory tract, and cause mild or no symptoms like the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or during the growth period can develop large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is severely ill, while there is not much transmission in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is far more severe than the SARS epidemic and is quite difficult to control.
In China, hopes and efforts are currently underway to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities and keeping the entire population in quarantine.
While these measures are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, they are reducing the number of new patients, indicating a slowing of the pandemic.
The most gratifying thing is that the epidemic will end in March and the stage of its dowan swing will be in 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so hopeful.
Paul Hunter, et al., has estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be a far more infectious disease than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Eralongi et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A group in Canada said mid-turbine and throat swabs of patients who had recovered from the hospital two weeks ago showed they had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a viral strain.
However, on the basis of a decrease in the number of new cases, there are promising signs in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
In fact, one million cases with half a million deaths were predicted in Ebola.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been overcome.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weak in spreading the infected disease and eventually end up being present with humans, or similar to the less-infected virus.
The COVID-19 epidemic in the following form has been compared with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through direct contact with coughing or sneezing and possibly virus-contaminated matter.
The virus is also found in the digestive tract, which creates a new possibility of transmission from the digestive tract to the mouth.
A recent study on 138 cases found that 41% of the cases included potentially non-communicable diseases, 17 patients with another disease, and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, housewives, colleagues, and even those who are in contact with patients or infected people should be very careful.
To reduce the risk of infection, the first defense is to wear a mask on the face; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23> 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from a potential infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects from which they can reach others.
However, only N95 (Serial <0x23>1860) masks can prevent the inhalation of small viral particles from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viral particles can fully penetrate, SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both of which are about 85 nm.
Even if five surgical masks are added together, the particle can still enter them, so health care workers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Serial <0x23>1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care workers must wear a quarantined gown to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should wear a transparent shield or fountain on the face when working with patients.
It is highly advisable for the public in affected or potentially affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant soaps, try to self-quarantine indoors and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered appropriate distance.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is the highest homogenization of SARS-CoV according to a report on January 7, 2020, and should cause a high alert for China based on a deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reassured citizens that the novel virus has a low infectious and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and that prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
The message gave the public's alarm, especially as they were preparing for the Spring Festival, a sense of relief, and wasted at least some time controlling the disease in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may have learned lessons from this difficulty and made significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be careful when making public announcements (1) as each word is important to citizens and can change the frequency and frequency of their actions; (2) the use of the disease in improving the quality of the patient's response to the disease rather than reporting to the doctor or the staff; (3) the use of the clinic's general information and response to the disease rather than providing relief to the public; (3) the prevention and control of the potential epidemic, in its early stages.
The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and around 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than young people and also has higher severity and mortality rates in older people than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (%1.44% compared to 10.91).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA may be negative for SARS-CoV-2 in some COVID-19 patients.
Otherwise, the virus can again be positive in recovered patients.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
In view of the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent of genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two beta SARS-like CoVs has been found, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Who was the original representative, from bats, to the intermediate species of virus transmission in humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transfer process and it can re-spread at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing show that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with this ACE2, how does this virus enter the respiratory tract cells and result in pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic continue?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a worldwide pandemic, will it end up like SARS or will it continue to be like Zika from time to time?
This is important, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal sources of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have advanced the mutual evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host animals, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as a common cold.
The Severe Respiratory Distress System (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory System (MERS) coined to show just how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 once again highlighted CoVs and its rapid transmission and reduction in pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV surprised us.
HCoV infection is an infection transmitted from animals to humans and it serves us to understand the animal source of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to host between deposits.
Identifying host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-hosted organisms in animals gives important awareness of pathogenic CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview on the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, in which we focus, along with the history of their discovery, on their animal source and mixed-species transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the point of view of the evolution of different viruses and the recovery of their genes.
In this context, the current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic will be discussed.
In addition, the requirements for successful host organism changes and the implications for virus prevention on the severity of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of envelopes, positive senses, single stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which used large genetics such as 26 to 32 kilobases between RNA viruses, were called "CoVs" due to the appearance of a crown-like morphology from the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have shared, undifferentiated genes in a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genes consist of two large open frames of riding on each other(ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polynomial diagrams of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polynomial implements an additional 16 non-structural elements, designated nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genetics includes ORFs for structural leukocytes, including nostril(S), envelope(E), membrane(M) and neo-cholesterol (N).
A large number of auxiliary proteins of a specific sequence are also encoded through CoVs of different sequences.
Based on the difference in the configurations of the lymph nodes, CoVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV generation mostly composed of HCoVs and further subdivided into more sequences (A,B,C and D).
Evidence from the phyllo genetics showed that, for the most part, bats and mice are the source of the genes of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the largest reserves of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually passed the barriers of different species and some of them emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Generally, HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause mild cold and/or diarrhea-like symptoms.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, which can lead to lower respiratory tract infections with the possibility of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extraplemonary abnormalities in relatively more patients.
In the mid-1960s HCoV-229E strain, B814 had isolated nasal discharges from patients with mild colds.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the outbreak of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs in general is harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is the most devastating event in current history, with a mortality rate of about 10%, affecting more than 8,000 people.
Ten years later, the spread of respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East resulted in a persistent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread all over the world.
HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world will have to prepare for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs are sourced from animals such as bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Numerous lines of evidence support the evolutionary origins of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses exhibit well-adapted and non-pathogenic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented countless medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
The tracking of the source animal of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the power of diffusion, and the mechanism of restriction of transmission across different species.
This may also aid or guide in finding a host of animal-derived, intermediate, and reared animals, with important implications in preventing future recurrences.
In this review, we will present an overview of the source animals, mixed species transmission, and pathogens of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the shared idea that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs would normally be non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts and become pathogenic after their transfer to their new host organism.
We also examine the evolution of HCoVs, which would often increase transmission with a decrease in the pathogen gene.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain B814 of HCoV-229E was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with mild colds, various animals infected with different CoVs, including turkey, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, were isolated.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
In terms of historical order, a brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs (Figure 1) will be informative and instructive.
In 1966, HCoV-229E pressure was isolated before the respiratory tract of patients suffering from respiratory tract infections, and was later adopted to increase WI-38 lung cell lines.
Between 10 and 20 percent of cases of HCoV-229E infected patients have mild colds, including chills, sneezing, restlessness, and symptoms of throat inflammation with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and then inserted into the cerebral pathway of the small mice brain.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection resemble those of people who have HCoV-229E, which are not symptomaticly different from other respiratory tract pathogens like influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were distributed globally, and they are more widespread in moderate climates during the winter.
In general, the growth time of these two viruses is less than a week, after which the disease lasts about 2 weeks.
According to the voluntary study of humans, the mild cold caused by the exposure of healthy people to HCoV-229E.
Only a few patients with a compromised immune system show severe infection of the lower part of the respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia", was the first well-documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history and is the SARS-CoV etiological agent, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Zhejiang province.
The SARS epidemic that spread to many countries and continents resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a growth period of 4 to 7 days and on the 10th day of the disease, is at the viral load range and can increase to about two secondary cases.
A patient infected with SARS-CoV initially has symptoms of muscle pain, chills, fever, discomfort, and cold, followed by symptoms such as dizziness, cough, and shortness of breath.
In rare laboratory tests of lympho pania, SARS, it is rare to have a random function of the liver and some high creatinine kinases.
In SARS patients, the spread of allergens, the spread of epithelial cells, and the increase of macrophages are also observed.
Then about 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, a number of organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can be affected, usually with cytokines storm, which can be particularly deadly in patients with low immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open lung biopsy of the index patient's relative, who travelled from Zhangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, HCoV research has been heavily devoted to research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands during the end of 2004.
Initially, it is found in younger children, the elderly, and patients with low-intensity respiratory disease.
In the disease caused by HCoV-BL63, nasal mucosa, asymptomatic eyes, fever and ulcerative colitis are common.
Another independent study described the same virus being isolated from an 8-month-old boy's nose sample in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 in the general respiratory illness is about 4.7%, and its symptoms are severe at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with rotting cough, also known as cramp.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong who was hospitalized due to pneumonia and typhoid fever.
With inflammation in the community-acquired pneumonia and typhoid duct, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with severe asthma.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which has a mild respiratory illness, were found worldwide.
These four community-acquired HCoVs are very well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause extreme pathogenic disease, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as the more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63.
Usually, when they acquire the ability to transmit HCoVs and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they become low-intensity pathogens or pathogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old Saudi patient suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Where the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases are found in the Middle East, and occasionally imported cases are found in European countries and Tunisia with a secondary prevalence in close contacts.
In 2015, a secondary epidemic spread in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which has advanced severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have severe kidney failure, which is very unique from MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30 percent of patients have symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there were 34.4% deaths in more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses found in humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end of 2019, a large number of pneumonia patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were last detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing respiratory tract infection outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global public health emergency, and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, of which 3.4% have died of the virus.
In particular, the death toll in these cases in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside of that it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough, and conjunctivitis.
Some patients have also been diagnosed.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia and it can increase acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar due to the constant similarity in the 82% high nucleoside, it is a cluster of different branches of the pathogenic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported symptoms of infected non-symptomatic subjects that could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in comparison and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, the duration and duration of the progression of the disease of HCoVs are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the other four derived from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, it has been commonly seen that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits its own infection characteristics during the infection of HCoVs derived from the community, including with no specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV infection, although this ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 reveals interesting features such as community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it enters the human body.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2, like other HCoVs, can be found in phytochemical samples.
Although at least in some circumstances that remain to be clarified in future studies, whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in oral eutrophication, as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2, like community-acquired HCoVs, will appear seasonal.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenesis, and sustainable spread after entering humans, will affect the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
By adapting well in humans, the four HCoVs derived from the community cause mild symptoms.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types may be survivors of the pandemic of the ancient HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans that cause severe HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs will have to be replicated in humans to counteract the ban of host animals to a large extent, and to collect the desired mutations.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and affects more people, the more likely humans are to adopt it completely.
If it is adopted well, then it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four CoVs derived from the community have been circulating in the population, creating a common cold in immune-controlled individuals.
These viruses do not require animal stockings.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted by humans and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to grow and thrive in their animal reserves, and possibly find an opportunity to spread into sensitive human targets through one or more medium and expanding hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least at this time, it is more capable of moving like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether humans will adopt it completely and whether it will circulate in humans without any deposits or intermediate host animals.
Before we talk about the origins of HCoVs, it would be better to talk about the evolution, nature, reserves, medium and broad definition of HCoVs host animals, and their properties.
An animal, if it has a closely related ethnic association, acts as the evolutionary host of HCoVs, sharing a high degree of similarity at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ethnographic virus usually spreads well in this host organism and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the host provides continuous and long-lasting shelter to the living HCoVs.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoVs or their parent viruses.
On the other hand, if HCoV is introduced to humans at or before the intermediate host, it is not able to adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as the animal's source of human infection and then play the role of a host that rapidly increases human infection in humans.
If HCoVs do not maintain the transfer within the intermediate host organism, it will go into the closed path of infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can adapt to the intermediate host organism and even establish long-term immunity.
In such a case, the middle host becomes the host of the living natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data has revealed with disappointment that the SARS index cases have a history of contact with sports animals.
A subsequent non-proliferation investigation found that animal traders had a higher incidence of SARS-CoV lggg than the general population.
In the live animal market, the first masked palm-suite cats (Peguoma Larvata) and a raccoon dog were identified to have SARS-CoV-like viruses.
This indirectly supports the fact that no SARS has been reported in the markets after killing all the seatbelts.
However, it has been reported that masked palm-suite cats from the forest or fields were largely negative to SARS-CoV without appearing in the live animal market, suggesting that masked palm-suite cats may only be acting as the expansive intermediate host, but they are not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since 80% of the different animals in Zhangzhou's markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, a number of smaller mammals cannot be ruled out of the possibility of acting as the expanding intermediate host of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear as closed-way hosts of SARS.
The discovery of the natural host animal of SARS-CoV has exposed the closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse-tailed bat.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibody and genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other beta-CoVs share a 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts of human pathogens.
Multiple SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 derived from a sample of bats' graces was demonstrated to be used as a receptor for bats, suit cats, and human ACE2 entry cell.
Interestingly, Sera's recovered SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related SARS-CoV to the breed of bats, which shares 95% nucleoside continuity similarities.
Despite the extreme similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the father virus of SARS-CoV directly and bats are not hosts of the immediate reservoir of SARS-CoV.
The membrane of MERS-CoV of the same group was analyzed as beta-CoV-HKU4 and beta-CoV-HKU5, a phyto-genetic analysis.
Beta CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV, the same representative receptor for virus entry, use dipole peptides 4 (DPP4).
RNA polymerase sequences based on the RNA of MERS identified from Europe and Africa are genetically closer to counterparts in beta-CoVs.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related beta CoV-HKU25 share a similarity of only 87 percent of nucleotide sequences.
Thus, bats cannot host MERS-CoV's immediate stockpiles.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that in a number of African countries, like the Middle East camels, there is a kobane camel seroposito for the specific unaffected antibody of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nose of a coban camel, and it further indicates that the camels serve as the real reservoir of MERS-CoV hosts.
It should be noted that, experimentally, the camels infected with MERS-CoV had generally mild symptoms but largely observed the flow of the virus.
In particular, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the pharynx oral route, which is also the main way for the virus to flow from bats.
However, questions remain because there is no history of multiple confirmed cases of MERS linked to camels prior to the onset of symptoms, including human-to-human transmission or the unknown animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide similarity with CoV RaT13 beta isolated from Ranulphus beta.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are great for assigning the fatherly relationship.
I mean, bet SARS-CoV-2 can't be a direct host of deposits unless a nearly identical bet CoV is found in the future.
Presumably, the wholesale market for Honen's seafood, which has many early cases of COVID-19 and which is likely indicative of animal-to-human transmission, will be the host animal between the SARS-CoV-2 species sold and killed.
A number of recent studies based on the meta-genetic sequence have suggested that a group of low-risk mammals known as pangolins (mans javelinas) may also be home to SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
These novel pangolin CoV genetics share 85-92 percent nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, these nucleotides are as closely associated with RaTG13 with approximately 90% identification at the level of Tide continuity.
These files are subsets of sub-genres like SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which shares 97.4 percent amino acids with constant identification, as well as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more diverse, despite the high degree of consistent matching genetic range.
Previous studies on the diseased pegolins have reported viral post-traumatic lung samples, similar to those related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study, the partial genetic sequence, which accounts for about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome, has adopted a variety of assembly methods and manual safety.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence to support direct SARS-CoV-2 of pangolin origin due to the continuity difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be established in bats, pangolins and other mammals.
While the best continuity matching has been found in the receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best broader genetic continuity similarities.
It is highly speculated that, selected arbitrariness between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in the receptor-binding domain is driven by careful evolution.
The third wild animal species has been proposed to respond in favor of recombination between beta-CoVs and RaTG13 related to pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The spread of multi-scale recombination between beta-CoVs, as a stimulant force in evolution, is present.
A decision on the direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be made.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied to be animal sources.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the original sources of both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be bat CoVs, while the father viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a beta CoV termed ARCoV.2 (applechain Ridge Co.) in the triangulated beta of North America has shown a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another beta-CoV term hepatosidros/ghanachem/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, on camels also suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origin of identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Filo genetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoVs moving mixed species in history.
When the domestic live stock HCoV-OC43 around 1890 crossed the species to infect humans, a global epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of the mixed-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Beta alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha CoV.
Numerous evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, in the shared ecological niche, bats can interact with humans, not with alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related beta alpha CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in beta, while alpha CoVs are caused by the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
In the end, the alpaca alpha CoV was not found in pets.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, human pathogenic viruses, including rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses and Hendra viruses, are directly sourced from bats.
So it's not too surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha CoVs act as a genetic reservoir of an HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels can act as intermediate agents, just like MERS-CoV cases, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoV bats serve as a perfect example of the transfer of mixed species from camels and camels to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by later findings.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus types for genetic fragmentation and interspecies transmission and interspecies exchange.
Long life, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, are favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced in a mountain camel for decades.
It has been well adapted to the camels that have been directly transformed from a host organism to a host of stable and natural reserves.
MERS-CoV maintains a very mild disease and relatively low rate mutation in these animals.
Its occasional transmission to humans is an accident and humans are the closed-loop hosts of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the role of pangolins, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be closed-loop hosts for SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV, which is similar to the seat cats in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, multiple possibilities of transmission of mixed-species SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans can be added or rejected.
First, bats can be the source of SARS-CoV-2, a host of almost identical viruses like SARS-CoV-2.
Humans share the ecological niche with bats through combustibles or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the fastest-growing intermediate host animals, with the SARS-CoV-2-related virus newly introduced.
The virus is transmitted to humans through hunting and hunting.
It is possible that a number of breast-feeding animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies are guaranteed in domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as mentioned above, the replication and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 can occur in the third species that interact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal sources of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major processes by virals in crossing several types of barriers.
First, they have relatively high mutation rates in RNA copy.
Compared to the second single stranded RNA viruses, the defined conversion rate of CoVs can be considered "high" from "moderate" to "high" while the average replacement rate of each year on each site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of novel host organisms to CoVs, is 10-4 as an alternative.
CoVs have a pro-reading external bona fides, whose deletions result in a more refined, attention-seeking, even impulsive response.
Interestingly, the neuocyte analog remdesivir is known to suppress the copy of CoVs through the inhibition of RNA polymerase dependent on this external binding and RNA.
Remdesivir is a highly intelligent agent tested as an anti-SARA-CoV-2 in medical practice.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is one million times higher than that of its host animals.
In addition, there are often times when CoVs cannot adapt well to host organisms, with a higher rate of mutation.
Compared to the highest mutation rate of SARS-CoV, there appears to be a lower mutation rate in well-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
Probably, it has already been adapted to another host animal close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which adapts well to a coban camel, is applicable.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the increased genetics will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective immediately.
Second, the genetics in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional imaging in genetic modification for mutations and replication in large RNAs, thus increasing the probability of interspecies evolution of mixed CoVs, which is beneficial for the appearance of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by a number of unique reading frames and lattice functions towards the 3' end of genetics.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection", CoVs often randomly switch to RNA templates.
During the copying of the CoV RNA, in the host organism that acts as a compound, the dorsal changes frequently.
The full length of the extreme homologous and sub-genetic RNAs to produce new CoVs can be recombinant.
Evidence of natural combination of phytogenetics has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as beta SL-CoV and beta-CoV-HKU9.
transmission of the virus to the host.
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host animal receiver is an important factor in the effective and mixed species transmission.
With this, the replication of SARS-CoV is taken as a common example, which gave evidence of positive selection during mixed species transmission.
In addition to the comparative analysis of the isolation of SARS-CoVs of humans and suites, SARS-CoV is thought to rapidly degrade in various host organisms, particularly with the mutation of the receptor-binding domain of S lymphocytes.
Typically, the receptor binding domain in CoV's S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is sharply selected through the host organism's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 fragment is the 318th to 510th amino acid, binding to human ACE2 as well as its corceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV receptors are able to identify ACE2 receptors for the binding domain that allow the transmission of mixed species of viruses to various animals, including bats, suit cats, mice, and raccoons.
In fact, only the remains of 6 amino acids in the receptor binding domain were found to be different in the isolated viral of humans and cats, 4 of them in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
The K479N and S487T mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SEAT SARS-CoV, which can enhance the interaction of pointed lymph with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can be important substituents for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting, that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the lymph nodes indicates that the necessary affinity of the S lymph with human ACE2 may change.
Indeed, the study of a transgenic electron microscope is indicating this association is 10 to 20 times greater than the association between human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other sub-recipients will be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-satellized silicic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can account for the successful adaptation of these CoVs after the mixed-species transmission from their host animal to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, HCoV-associated species transmission results are monitored, dependent on another host organism, and through binding mechanisms.
The spread of these hosts between humans and hosts with natural reserves of HCoVs, such as bats, a mountain camel, and mice, can hinder the transmission of mixed species.
In HCoVs, a successful mixed-species transmission is the binding factor of the angry host organism's dependents and disrupting host's binding factors.
In this regard, the identity and characteristics of this important part of the interaction with the host organism of the virus are yet to be determined.
The host organism's dependence and non-invasive broad genetic testing of binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may be beneficial with the use of CRISPR's latest technology.
H1N1 Vaccines: Back to the Future
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the release of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a reservoir of the genes of an HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic replication also enhance the evolution of HCoVs and act as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of the novel laxative coding gene has the potential to rapidly change the phenotype of the viral.
In the host proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important in human adaptation, as the beta viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated but found to have different encodings of ORF-8 proteins.
In the very beginning of the human epidemic, the strains that were isolated have been found to have the properties of elimination of 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is an adaptational mutation that promotes transmission in host animals.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of recombinant recombination with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase recombination smaller regions were identified.
The sites of the reticulocyte were identified in parts of nsp9, more commonly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in a mountain camel in Saudi Arabia, has had to experience recurrences between different streams.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other CoVs, in which HCoVs recombination with their non-structural genes with other animal CoVs.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genetics, possibly resulting from selective suppression, such as the host's immune system, being immune to the virus.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of the ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, leading to the deletion of two nucleotypes.
Although the retention of ORF4 in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E can be observed, the alpaca alpha-CoV shows the insertion of a single neocalotype, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selected pressure in their reservoir hosts.
When bats are infected with CoVs, an unsympathetic or mild symptom is detected, which indicates a mutual affinity between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats have good compatibility with CoVs both anatomy and physically.
For example, defects in activating the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and large histocompatibility complexes in bats are suppressed due to low levels of expression of the enzymes of class I.
Furthermore, reactivate the high levels of the type of oxygen produced by the high meta-bolic activity of bats (ROS) by suppressing the copy of both CoVs, and by influencing the probe readings through the X-ray bonacle to create highly pathogenic virus strains, when a new host is introduced, provides selective pressure.
More pathogenic CoV strains may develop through recombination, which may increase the host's adaptation to novel pathogens or pathogens to acquire features.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their reservoir host animals such as bats and camels.
They produce robustly replicas without the immune response of the powerful host organism.
In this, the secrets of why unsympathetic diseases are shown and the cause of severe cases in human infections are hidden.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokinin strom in which, from the powerful immune response, more intense lung damage occurs.
On the other hand, in an unsympathetic pathogen, the immune response has been de-coupled from the copy of the CoV.
In the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the same strategy to neutralize the immune response has a beneficial effect.
In particular, the interferon reaction in bats is particularly potent.
Therefore, the organization of type I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
For this reason, it may be beneficial to do with the prevention of NLRP3 inflammation in the treatment of COVID-19 with MCC950.
The emission of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea emerging through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a bat beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a beta-CoV that shares a nucleotide similarity of 96% with SARS-CoV-2.
While the civet and other animals in the market have been found to harbor viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, which means that pangolins are acting as a receptor to one of the intermediate host organisms, or that pangolin beta-CoVs can put the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have come back to light.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have radically changed our views on animal sources and animal deposits of HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are sourced from bats and have been transmitted to humans through a medium host.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and the civets in the markets, the SARS epidemic can be effectively eliminated by closing the meat markets and killing the civets.
For this reason, in view of the discovery of numerous sequences of pangolin beta-CoVs, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent transmission from animals.
However, future investigations have yet to clarify when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other breast-feeding animals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in a mountain camel for a long time.
For locals, these camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool, as well as an important means of transportation.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS just as it did in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, a sensible approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, they can cause the emergence of a new genetic type.
Species and species of animal CoVs are circulating in the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs are very diverse with capacities in animals.
As a result of the emission of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly to humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to develop and recover.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals in some places in China should abandon the culture of eating.
With the trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They live in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many features that cause the spread of viruses, if people are educated, the chances of contact with bats and other wildlife species in humans can be reduced.
A better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts requires constant monitoring of dairy animals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the disease from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, by staying away from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans, the virus transmitted from animals to humans can be prevented more effectively.
Several pieces of the puzzle of being a source animal of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ethnographic virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interesting to see if bats and pangolins can share the same environmental strength under what conditions.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a real intermediate representative, it must explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, because many other breast-feeding animals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both their monitoring and experiments for infection should be conducted.
If there are bats, pangolins, or any other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 and its parent viruses, which are almost identical, will be identified in its natural representatives in the future.
Continuing research in this field will explain the evolutionary journey of SARS-CoV-2 in animals as well as have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for the "suspected case" and "verified case" of COVID-19 must be renewed
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advisory guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, this guide provides our experience and a good reference for fighting against the worldwide pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, based on the results of our ongoing research in awareness and knowledge, and the experience of medical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines, which have been issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, saying that the latest diagnostic standards for "suspected case" and "verified case" are provided in accordance with the final guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is known as severe respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advisory guideline and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has gained a lot of attention since its release.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on our ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued a guideline for diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with a total of seven issues being released from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some fundamental changes being made in the context.
Now that our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al., he has suggested easy scoring based on his medical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidebook and is a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We acknowledge their outstanding work and thank them for it.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest assessment and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis is needed to confirm the suspected case by combining any one of the features of the history of the epidemic with two items of medical diagnosis, or by combining three items of medical medicine without a clear history of the epidemic:
Epidemiological history: (1) cases of respiratory infection from Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other communities where there have been minor cases reported in the previous 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> travel or residence history of COVID-19 cases from the infected area; (2) contact history from infected cases of SARS-CoV-2, or from the first symptoms of novel acid testing; (3) from Wuhan city and surrounding areas or such community as
Medical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with visual features of COVID-19 infection; (3) shows the number of white blood cells in the early onset stage as normal, decreasing, or low lymphocyte count.
The presence of pathogenic or serological evidence should be diagnosed as having a confirmed case of antidiabetic infection with one of the following items: (1) positive of real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) continuation of the entire viral genes showing high affinity for known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive case of SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) counts.
Pathogen detection in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) counts; and serological evidence was included in the seventh.
Investigation-based modifications are underway to quickly diagnose the confirmed quality by searching for a more nucleic acid detection kit, as well as taking respiratory tract, including blood samples that increase the availability of different samples, and helping to bring about positive results of the specific antibody.
In addition, there is a lot of evidence that reminds us of caution from patients with traditional symptomatic and unsympathetic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zoe et al. should be updated, as they have classified the individual into a "low risk" without medical symptoms.
The score system also needs to be confirmed in further medical practice and studies.
As a result, we expect more direct evidence to come in and ask readers to give their feedback.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "verified cases," we advise them to track and comply with the latest guidelines in their home countries.
Our team provides timely updates to our guide to offer assistance.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest in a day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's epidemiological agency, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Giving details in an online news, IEDCR director Dr. Merjadi Sabrina Flora said four men were among the dead, including a woman.
According to Dr Mir Jidi, the two cases were aged over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
A hospital official told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif-ur-Rehman, the director of Bengali anti-corruption, who was taken care of at Kuwait's Matri Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridge Minister Obaid al-Qadr said that public transport will be closed for a long time from this coming week under the initial plan.
Initially, the closure of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Essential goods -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- were still allowed to be transported.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh on March 8 were recorded in the wife of two people who had returned from Italy and one of them.
As of 19 March, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide has exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are related to COVID-19, a disease linked to the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and the first death related to the coronavirus in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed it was one of the few countries so far free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases after 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
With 5,900 deaths linked to the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were recorded.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that as of Wednesday, more than 1,000 U.S. deaths had been caused by coronavirus infection.
Across the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to the Russians would continue until April 30 without work.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favor, 10 in favor, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day: earlier, the curfew was effective from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on the day.
Thailand will enforce a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio's governor, Mike Devine, announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
In Australia, the limit of toilet tissue paper in stores is reduced in every transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays, Australian store chains Walworth and Coles reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper in all stores nationally by two and a pack per transaction.
Aldi also introduced a pack limit, on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkout, and chain's Facebook backpages.
Due to the fear of COVID-19, buyers were reported to store it in case of need of self-isolation of people.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes came in line with the four-pack restrictions on every transaction previously introduced by Woolworth and Coals on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in a media release on March 8, reported that with a four-pack ban in place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI said in a Facebook post on Tuesday, calling it "unprecedented."
According to Woolworth's spokesman, last week's sales had "increased significantly".
Costco's store in Canberra also limited last week's allowed number to two packs.
To reduce the shortage, Coals ordered large packets from suppliers and increased the supply chain, Woolworth ordered additional storage, while ADLI stocked for special initial availability on planned Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase stockpiles, but the local council's ban on delivery trucks made it difficult.
In addition to rising production costs, they try to meet supply demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock discount, some stores couldn't run on a specific Wednesday.
The retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, Dr. Gary Martimer, said in a report by News.com.au that stores fill up stores every night.
He said that toilet tissue paper is a big thing, due to which it has a small amount of storage, and, when sold, leaves the vast space of the shelf empty, which makes sense of a severe shortage.
Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News on, Coles and Woolworth's review [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toiletries and sanitizers can go [buy] and if it's in quantities, maybe you can reduce panic.
The manufacturer of a crepe-recycled toilet tissue paper said on Wednesday that they would be without storage.
According to News.com.au's report, Kimberly Clark, who makes clarinet toilet tissue, and Solaris who make sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a property buying and selling site, said that some of the property sellers in Melbourne offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction, while some auctions were held at the time when buyers had time due to the long weekend on the occasion of International Workers' Day.
Hidden in the journal Darwin, the Thursday issue of NT News included eight-page insulators, which meant they were cut and used as toilet tissue paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were actually reluctant to impose the restrictions, which they said they had no plans to introduce a ban on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for masks, sanitisers, dry goods, hand sanitizers and other products, including flour, is also high.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside of Australia, British supermarket purchases were observed to be limited to a pack of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the continued spread of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a global pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to how dangerous certain cases are, the World Health Organization stressed the need for governments to act.
All countries can now change the face of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people in response.
We are deeply concerned by the two dimensions of the disease, the extent of its acceleration and severity, and the alarming extent of action against it.
According to Dr Tom Frieden, the former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
"In addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected in this sequence from the beginning to the global outbreak," he said in his observations published in CNN in February.
Ghebreyesus said, "We have never seen a pandemic that is far from the coronavirus."
"And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he continued.
The new status of the pandemic came after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "What is important is that it is heading towards further destruction."
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 patients in the world stood at 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The current 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which causes severe respiratory illness coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and identified as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 patients were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is estimated to be 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.8% in New Zealand.
Its common symptoms include fever, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.
The complications may include severe symptoms of pneumonia and difficulty breathing.
The period from the appearance of the disease to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be in the range of two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment - suggested precautions include hand washing, coughing, distance from other people, and monitoring and strict isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world are also supportive of travel restrictions, quarantine, the implementation of curfews, risk control at the workplace, and the implementation of facilities closures.
The pandemic has led to delays in many global social events, such as funerals, funerals, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods due to shopping.
In 193 countries, schools and universities were closed either nationally or locally, affecting about 99.4% of the world's population.
Misconceptions about the virus spread online, and there have been instances of discrimination and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asia, and people where the virus has become more prevalent.
Due to low inflows and the closure of large industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China, reported a collection of pneumonia cases for an unknown reason on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of these cases were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and are therefore believed to be a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases.
The virus, which causes the outbreak known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first person to show no symptoms of the disease was a person who became ill on December 1, 2019.
Two-thirds of the initial incidents reported in December 2019 were related to the markets.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post recommended in an unconfirmed report that the incident of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019 could be the first.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although cases in China were decreasing, due to a sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases per capita from China increased for the first time in China.
It can also reduce the number of cases, especially in people with common symptoms of the disease.
On February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of the world's cases. Britain's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Wellens, estimated that 60% of the UK population would be affected before an effective crowding could be avoided.
According to the official protocol, the number of cases is the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and their results have been confirmed to be positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested 3% of its population, and the official policy of many countries was not to test only those with mild symptoms, such as those in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 showed that in China, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients could not be detected until January 23, and that unregistered patients were the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
The initial estimated number of primary repeat production for COVID-19 is (R0) 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not, the period from the appearance of symptoms of the disease to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China occur in people over the age of 60, and 75% of people already have pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and official deaths from the sugar-COVID-19 global pandemic usually consist of deaths that have tested positive, according to official protocols.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 could be much higher, as these deaths do not include people who die without a test - for example at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the additional death toll during the pandemic was higher than the official death toll from COVID-19 at x4-5.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "we know that the number of reported deaths has been low", a statement that confirms reports of fewer deaths in the U.S. since January 9.
The first death outside of mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have occurred outside of central China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths from each continent, except the Pacific South. Several joint measures are used to determine deaths.
These numbers vary with the region and time of year, and are influenced by testing, quality of treatment systems, treatment options, time after the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality and incidence ratio is 6.0% as of April 10, 2020 (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The proportion of cases and deaths in China (from 1 January 2020 to 10 January 2020 for individuals with symptoms of the disease) has dropped from 17.3% to 0.7% for individuals with the disease (from 1 February 2020 to 1 February 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) and the mortality rate (CFR) of the infected people, which shows the percentage of people who died from the disease, and the mortality rate (IFR) from the infection.
These numbers are not for a specific time period and are for a particular population from infection to the final solution of the case.
Several experts have tried to count this number for a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford has estimated that the mortality rate from infection in this global epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.39% overall.
The upper limit of this estimate is in line with the results of the first separate COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims that this pandemic can be controlled.
The extent and duration of the pandemic is uncertain.
"If not investigated, multiple outbreaks generally grow like a plateau and then start to come down when the disease is no longer host," said Macy's Bonnie, from Penn State University.
However, it is impossible to predict when this will happen."
Zong Nanshan, the Chinese government's top medical adviser, stressed that "it could end by June" if all countries were encouraged to follow its advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Charsky told Adam of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate independently for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, distancing and other measures will be needed "unless a vaccine becomes available (temporarily 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's likely that the coronavirus will completely disappear — because it's easily transmissible" and that it will "be transformed into a seasonal disease, and will continue to come back every year."
The death toll of the return will depend on the extent of the reduction of the African population and its variability.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively undiagnosed and infected people can be without symptoms.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include tachycardia, bulge in the throat, loss of ability to breathe, shortness of breath, pain in the joints, sore throat, cold, cough, conjunctivitis, and severe breathing difficulties. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports almost everything.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adds to the list of emergency symptoms: shortness of breath, frequent chest pain or pressure, sudden allergic reactions, difficulty waking up, and numbness of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some of these infected people may be asymptomatic, they can be confirmed by test results without medical symptoms, so the researchers issued a recommendation that people who came in contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
In China, the proportion of symptomless diseases is measured from a few numbers to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) usually ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.For example, the cessation of smelliness in people infected with COVID-19<0x2B> was initially reduced to 30% in people who were later reduced to 15% in people.
The extent to which the disease is transmitted is still being investigated.
The disease is believed to be initially caused by close relationships and from small droplets that are produced when coughing, sneezing or speaking; where the distance in close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that without danpe can be dropped from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also spread through tiny droplets that remain in the air for longer periods of time when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when exhaled, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually in the air.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby, or possibly enter the lungs while breathing.
Some medical procedures such as inhaling through the nose and artificial inhaling through the mouth (CPR) can bring out the respiratory tract and thus it can spread into the air.
It can also spread when someone touches the affected surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the face, the risk is considered very low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the body of the female, which is highly contagious for three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread before symptoms and in the final stage of the disease.
Since people test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that transmission of the disease is possible even before the appearance of effective symptoms.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported from the laboratory, where there are no pre-existing symptoms, but in some countries, contact tracing has been detected without symptoms.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, a person can usually infect two to three people - the virus can survive at different levels for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable on plaster (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for a day, and on copper for up to four hours.
However, this period varies in humidity and temperature. COVID-19 tests have been positive in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, but British authorities advise handwashing after contact with animals, such as when contacting other surfaces that have been infected.
Severe respiratory symptoms coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, which has previously been isolated from three people with pneumonia who appear to be from a group of acute respiratory illness in the city of Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective physical coronaviruses - outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated from the garrelo soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is believed that its breed is from zoonotic diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the family of B-ta-coronavirus (n-B), which is derived from two twigs of bats in the fry lineage.
At the overall genome level, it is 96% similar to the other bat coronavirus specimen (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one amino acid difference was found in a few parts of the genome sequence in human and pangolin viruses.
In comparison to the complete genome to date, it has been found that 92% of the genetic material is often shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is sufficient to prove that the pangolin virus is the intermediate host of the virus.
The temporary diagnosis of infection from the virus may be based on the symptoms of the disease, although confirmed by infected fluids or ICT X-rays are eventually carried out via reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan found that CT is less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its imaging properties cover the function of other pneumonias and diseases.
As of March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screens or as a precursor to COVID-19 testing.
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is performed on the respiratory tract or blood sample.
Results are usually available from a few hours to a few days.
Usually, this test is carried out by in-vitro cotton, although cotton can also be used in the throat - many laboratories and companies also conduct insulation testing, which detects antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these were sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test has been developed by Celex, which was approved for emergency use only in certified laboratories.
The characteristic of reflection on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of those with symptoms of the disease include asymptomatic peripheral ground glass opiates and absent excess flow.
The Italian Radiology Society is creating an international online database of photographic results of confirmed events.
Due to overlap with other infections such as the Adenovirus, the identification of COVID-19 imaging without PCR verification is of limited character.
In a large study in China, the chest CT results were compared with PCR, which showed that although imaging for infection is of low quality, it is faster and more sensitive, with the suggestion that it should be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks were created to detect both the virus's imaging features, via radiography and CT.
Preventive strategies for transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, touching eyes, nose or mouth without touching hands, and sneezing and sneezing and sneezing and sneezing in tissue and rinsing the tissue directly into the garbage can.
People who are already infected with the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Measures to prevent transmission of the disease are also suggested - many countries have restricted travel or prevented non-essential travel to other countries or to travel to areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading to communities in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within society and some communities don't know how and where they've been affected. Health care workers, who are at risk of contracting the disease, are advised to follow standard precautions to prevent contact and eye protection.
For this purpose, privacy concerns have been raised by governments from using occasional palace data via mobile phones, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting this type of surveillance.
As of April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented it or have advised voluntary use, with more than a dozen groups working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to access the user's location from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if he or she has been close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19; misunderstandings are circulating regarding the prevention of infection; for example, watering the nose and sneezing with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but several agencies are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC often advises people to wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are obviously dry; before going to bed; and when cleaning a nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by garrelo soap when its protective shell breaks.
The CDC recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol in volume when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces should also be cleaned in a number of ways (stainless steel surfaces should be exposed to a disinfectant for one minute), including %62-71 ethanol, %50-100 asopronol, %0.1 sodium hypochlorite, %0.5 hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2 to 7.5 piodon-iodine.
Other methods, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidric gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or confirmed COVID case appears at a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas, such as offices, toilets, shared spaces, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, ATM machines used by sick people, should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth with a curved nose or tissue while coughing and sneezing, and that such tissue be destroyed immediately.
Wearing a surgical mask is recommended for those who may be affected, because wearing a mask limits both the size and distance of the affected person's extruded droplets to go away, when he talks, sneezes and ejaculates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask reduces the likelihood of people touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if done without using proper hand hygiene."
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a mask for healthy people only if their health is in serious danger, as they are treating a COVID-19 patient, although they acknowledge that wearing a mask prevents people from touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, CDC advises wearing non-medical face masks made of cloth - China has specifically recommended that healthy people from the public use disposable medical masks, especially when others are at risk of getting close to (1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends using public transportation sources or wearing surgical masks while staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering the country without wearing a mask or touching their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has said that everyone should wear a mask when entering the shops.
Israel has asked all residents to wear a face mask when entering the country.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks in trains and buses running between cities from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask while going out of the house, while in the home, it is also advised to prepare masks for those who are not able to buy masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes disease control actions aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These methods include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods while staying at home, avoiding going into crowds, not receiving greetings, and physically distancing themselves.
Many governments are imposing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of gatherings proposed by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (with no known case of map COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people, which was later reduced to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people, keeping elderly people and people who are in close physical contact with other people, such as those who are sick, or who are unable to maintain physical distance, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and weak immune systems.
The term social distancing has led people to assume that they should be completely isolated from the world, rather than being encouraged to interact with other people in alternative ways.
They also recommend that you only have sexual contact with people who have no symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected to be infected.
Health institutions have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended the entire population living in an affected area to go into self-quarantine.
The most severe form of self-quarantine has been issued to those who are in a high-risk group.
Those who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible disclosure.
Strategies to control an epidemic include prevention, control, or pressure and mitigation.
The containment strategy is designed in the early stages of the pandemic and aims to detect and isolate infected people, introduce other infection control measures, and vaccinate them to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent further spread of the disease, efforts are made to enter the phase of mitigation: measures are taken to reduce its spread and its impact on the health system and society.
Both prevention and mitigation measures should be taken at the same time.
More stringent measures need to be put in place to suppress the pandemic from 1 to less than the primary outbreak. Part of the management of the infectious disease outbreak is to try to reduce the rise of the epidemic, which is called flattening the epidemic.
It reduces concerns for health services that are being overwhelmed, and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment discovery.
Non-discriminate measures that can manage the spread of the epidemic include preventive measures, such as hand washing, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing in cities, such as school closures and the cancellation of public gatherings; involving the community to encourage people to accept such measures.
Other countries have taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has made large-scale screenings and quarantines locally and issued warnings on the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those affected who quarantined themselves and imposed fines on those who did not.
Similarities between the United States and the United Kingdom show that mitigation (a decrease in the spread of the pandemic but not ending) and pressure (a rise in the pandemic) are major challenges.
More and more mitigation policies can bring the rise in health demand to two-thirds and the death rate to half, but sooner it could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the health system being vanquished.
Stress can be prioritized as a transition, but it should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if it is previously) otherwise it quickly returns to health when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic, causing social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including experiments on existing drugs.
The use of anti-cold medicines, drinking too much water and resting helps to eliminate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, it may be necessary to apply oxygen, to the vein, and to take help in breathing.
The use of steroids can further aggravate the consequences.
Many of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that "a number of traditional and homeopathic remedies" can help in relieving SARS-CoV-19 disease.
The increase in the capacity and adaptability of healthcare providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a fundamental step in responding to the pandemic.
The ECDC and the Regional European Union Office of Global Health have issued guidelines for changing resources at various stages for hospitals and primary health centers, including focusing on laboratory services on the ability to test for COVID-19, to reject optional behaviours when possible, isolate and isolate COVID-19 positive patients and intensive care by training personnel.
There are many theories as to where the first event (the zero patient) would have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei began to gradually increase.
Most of these incidents are attributed to the Holsell Sea Market in Honen, where animals are also sold, and there is a theory that the virus came from this type of animal; in other words, the virus belongs to a genus of animal diseases.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central Wuhan hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of them, including Dr. Lee Wenliag, were warned by the police of spreading rumours and another one, I-Fin, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading sensationalism.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
By early January, Wuhan's health authorities had been informed of enough cases of unknown pneumonia to order an investigation, with the number doubling almost every seven and half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, with the main role played by China's arrival for the New Year as Wuhan was the main transportation source and rail interchange.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in just one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.

On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus, several U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, witnessed their sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, the biggest one-day fall since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
All three indexes fell more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, SCOPE Ratings GMBH confirmed China's self-destructive credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stock markets fell again due to fear of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many people believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than in the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the most affected areas due to travel restrictions, closure of public places, including tourist centers, and travel restrictions imposed by governments globally.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Cantas, canceled flights due to low demand, while British domestic airline Flyby also fell off the runway.
There was a never-before-seen impact on the marine tourism industry.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The outbreak came at a time with China, a major travel season associated with New Year's Eve in China.
A number of events, many of which had to be attended by crowds, were canceled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's celebration, in which prominent companies also closed their shops and tourist centers, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar Year celebrations and tourist centers, including Forbidden City and traditional dome fairs in Beijing, were closed to avoid crowds.
Municipal and regional officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces have ordered New Year's Eve celebrations to be extended until February 10, and most workplaces will not reopen until that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to the infectious disease to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, under which schools were closed until March and New Year's celebrations were canceled.
Access to retail stores in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retail sales in North America and the Middle East fell by 50-60%.
This reduced the number of pedestrians to shopping centres by 33-43% in March compared to February.
The world's shopping mall operators have implemented additional measures, such as additional cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check buyers' temperature, and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession caused by the pandemic could cause another 14 to 22 million people in Latin America to live in extreme poverty.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic peaked in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China had lost their jobs.
More than 300 million people in China's far-flung provinces have been displaced or stranded in Hubei province, where more than 10 million Americans were unemployed in March 2020 and have applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus disease could cause a loss of 47 million in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. In India, lock-down workers (daily wage earners) have become unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
France and the UK have also adopted a compensation scheme for Germany's short-term work.
The world's arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, impacting the actions of individuals with institutions - both in employment and in autonomy.
The organizations of the Department of Arts and Culture sought to sustain their mission (often with public support) in order to provide society with access to cultural heritage, maintain the protection of its employees and the public, and, as far as possible, support artists.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, art venues and other cultural institutions in different parts of the world have been closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and events have been cancelled or postponed.
Another recent and sharpest failure of the disease was the cancellation of religious services, important keel events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that Happy Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian Lent season, was canceled.
Many pastors have advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending worship on Sundays; some churches have started broadcasting church worship via radio, live TV, or online, while others have children in the car.
As the Roman Catholic priests of Rome closed their churches and chapels, and St. Peter's Square became empty of Christian visitors, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic and the closure of shrines, while Saudi Arabia closed the entry of foreign visitors and the closure of holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused significant disruption to the world's sporting calendar since World War II.
The major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA, the session, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the activity "will be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but will not be held after the summer of 2021."
Due to this, many gamblers have moved online, and there has been a significant increase in the new sign-ups of many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been particularly affected, many music groups have postponed or canceled their concerts.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many fans have found ways to work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional lyo performances, such as the lyo streaming event, and bring it to others, or keep making web-based "mela" so that fans can perform, spread and advertise their work.
Online, many memes have spread based on the idea of coronavirus as many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, on the Chinese and East Asian side, Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic has shown severity, much prejudice, xenophobia, fear of strangers and racism.
There have been incidents of fear, doubt and opposition, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific regions.
According to reports in February (when most cases were confined to China), Chinese people have been subjected to racist sentiments in various groups around the world, which deserve the virus to be claimed in return.
There are also anti-Chinese sentiments in some African countries.
Many of the detainees in Wuhan and Hubei have reported regional differences.
For the Chinese, both online and offline, and those in areas affected by the virus have been supported.
After outbreaks and outbreaks in other countries, Italians, the first country in Europe to experience COVID-19 outbreaks, may face such suspicions and fear of strangers.In an effort to curb the disease, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed applications that seek to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US, have reported cases of racism-based abuse and humiliation.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics calling the term racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhar.
Students from northern India, bordering China, and studying in India's major cities were subjected to harassment related to the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal, stated that China had destroyed nature and "that's why God has taken revenge on them."
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Kolkata, calling it "misguided" and said that fear of foreigners in China since the pandemic has fueled feelings of racism from non-Chinese residents, calling foreigners "foreign trash" that is "cooling."
Many newspapers with paywalls have removed them to cover some or all of their coronaviruses.
Many scientific material publishers made scientific papers related to this spread available to everyone.
Many scientists quickly sent their results to the server, such as BioRixiv, before publication.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include procedures that detect the presence and presence of viruses that produce antibodies as a result of infection.
RT-PCR samples confirm the presence of the virus, which detects the coronavirus's RNA.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibiotics (serialogy) can also be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibodies tests showed how many people had the disease, including those with so few symptoms that it was too mild to report or had no symptoms.
Based on the results of these tests, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity present in a population can be determined.
Due to limited tests, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is also a huge difference in how many tests have been conducted between countries.
The rate of death due to this variant is very different in the report, which is likely to be higher than the estimate in some countries.
Tests on respiratory samples using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be obtained in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The PT-PCR test is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later when it begins to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears in the throat.
For those infected who have been tested for the second week, alternatively sample material can be used from deep airways through suction catheter or cough-up material (thick).
The first PCR test was carried out in January 2020 at the charity's site in Berlin using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which formed the basis for the World Health Organization's (WHO) distribution of 250,000 kits.
On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" gene that is spread by beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2 distributions. The BGI group in China was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for its PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.
One out of three tests in the older version of the test ketone failed to yield results due to poor chemical interactions, and in Atlanta, the CDC was able to obtain less than 100 samples in a single day in February 2020.
As of 28 February 2020, the two-factor test was not considered reliable, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to conduct the test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the emergency use authorization, and U.S. business laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made available COVID-19 testing across the country as of March 9, 2020.
The amount limits have not been announced; the collection of samples and further processing should be in line with the CDC's requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was created and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
According to the Mayo Clinic report on 12 March 2020, it has developed a test for the detection of COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for the test, which could be done in a large number of 3.5 hours, i.e. a machine could do about 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Holographic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, thanks to this method, positive results are achieved in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 machines in the U.S., and Abbott expects to increase the number of machines he makes to 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses a monoclonal antibody that can be specifically limited to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, being produced in Taiwan at speeds of up to 15 minutes, with the hope that the results will be as fast as the influenza test.
The closing words of the review of the written material in March 2020 are that "there is no significance to the radiograph assessment of the chest in the initial floor, however the presence of [CT computed tomography] is possible before symptoms appear."
CT's general characteristics include two-way multi-lobed ground glass matting, which covers the opacity and the back split.
As this disease grows, there is the development of complete domination, madness, and stability.
Wuhan, where this global epidemic originated the most, suggested in a study comparing between PCR and CT with that of CT is more sensitive to PCR, although less specific, with many of its characteristics similar to pneumonia and disease stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first priority for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
Partial immune response to infection, including IgM and IgG, is the production of antibodies.
They can be used to detect infections in people who have had symptoms for 7 days, to determine immunity, and for people who are under close surveillance.
Many clinical laboratories will be able to produce high-yield automated tests, but their availability will be restricted to the production rate for each system.
For CLT, a single sample of blood is usually used, although many samples can be used to detect the strength of the immune system.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually obtained by drilling on the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notification to the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than traditional PCR for detecting RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection, and in early April the UK found that none of the test kits purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that allows suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", he or she will be able to take the test, send it back to the hospital and get the result after some time, the NHS has announced that it is launching a scheme to test the suspected cases at home, with the help of other patients.
The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that it had the capacity to conduct 12,000 tests per day in a typical sitting and 10,700 tests last week.
When it comes to health care, health insurance costs money.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
The test was offered in several major cities until March 19.
The number of tests conducted in Germany as of 26 March 2020 is not known, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, 483,295 samples were tested on the calendar week 12/2020, and this week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6%) were tested positive for 2-SARS-CoV. In Israel, the researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and adopted a method to test samples from 64 patients at the same time.

The Wuhan laboratory method was quickly adopted by the Huo-Yan laboratories located in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus in total 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, Origami Assays has released open-source multi-layered designs that can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients with just 93 attempts.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents have become a barrier to mass testing in the EU and the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to examine protocols for the preparation of samples that limit the samples to 98 C (208 F) for five minutes to allow RNA genome or chromosomes to be excreted for further testing.The UAE is now testing more of its population's coronaviruses than any other country, and plans to reach its entire population.
Such a draw came from both the capability of the drone and the large population-produced laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "HUO-Yan" emergency detection laboratories located in China).
Established in 14 days, the laboratory carried out thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to work on such a large scale other than China.
Various testing techniques have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German structure for low-income countries, which do not have the resources to make cuts.
The German formulation, published on January 17, 2020, made in the United States to control the disease, was not available until January 28, raising concerns over the quality of the test kits in China and the United States in the early days of the pandemic, which delayed tests available in the United States, and could not provide the cuts despite recommendations and demands from health experts in countries and Australia.
On the other hand, experts say that the spread of the novel coronavirus has decreased due to the large supply of testing in South Korea.
The South Korean government has developed testing capabilities in private-sector laboratories in the past few years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for strengthening testing programs to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased testing demand and tens of millions of tests in U.S. private labs, and pressure on the supply of wound healing soap and chemical interactions.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the U.S., the CDC's kits had "failures," the government then removed office barriers that caused private testing. Spain bought the kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasis Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the incorrect results was the failure to properly use the samples or the cuts.
Spain's ministry said the faulty resulting kits would be removed and replaced with the testing kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the state Czech gave the wrong results. 1.2 million test kits purchased from China by Slovakia did not come out correct.
Atlas Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said the kits that Turkey bought from China "have a very high error rate" and were "not put into use."The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
In the event of a positive test result, the efforts to identify quarantined individuals and individuals who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients have yielded good results.
In the Italian town of Vo, where the first death from COVID-19 occurred, researchers working on the entire population, which consisted of about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
Nearly half of the people tested with no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
Due to the limited travel to a particular human group, the cases of the new infection were completely eliminated.
Due to extensive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has had little impact on Singapore compared to the developed countries of the world where there were no strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay confined to their homes from March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries were also unable to contain the pandemic through stricter measures such as contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but did not impose a stricter lockdown, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have tested higher, at higher mortality rates have lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have been able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
The WHO has recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories dealing with COVID-19 should send their top five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for verification testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below is related to a country's testing policy.
The country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests than the country that tests all citizens, regardless of whether they show symptoms or not, will take them all the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing) is also known as hand hygiene, the purpose of this process is to cleanse your hands from soil, grease, germs, or other non-essential materials.
On some "necessary occasions" frequent hand washing with soap in a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera germs entering the mouth.
People can also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five essential occasions in a day when washing hands with soap are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food and after touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, hands can also be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization has given the following suggestions for washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after a patient's illness.
After changing the diaper or cleaning of the child using the toilet.
After brushing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the maintenance of medical procedures in accordance with the principles of hygiene.
Washing hands before eating or taking medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of medical hand washing is to cleanse the hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microbes that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or spread disease.
This is especially true for people who are in the food or medical field, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the spread of diarrhoea; reducing system respiratory infections;
And the mortality rate among children born at home is low.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand washing habits significantly improved height in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce children's deaths from respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality due to these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce the mortality rate from diarrheal events by a third, and this can be compared to the supply of clean water in low-income areas.
The rate of diarrhoea death can be reduced by up to 48% due to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive means of prevention of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million child deaths each year.
Changing the habit of washing hands before and after a meal to nature can save more lives by using a vaccine or medically interrupting, which is a reduction of half of deaths due to diarrhea and one-fourth of deaths due to severe respiratory infections, according to UNICEF.
Hand washing is a part of the Water, Sanitation and Sanitation Program (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against early infections that are transmitted directly from the mitochondria.
One of the disadvantages of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by drying out the skin.
According to a 2012 study in Denmark, excessive hand washing can cause skin irritation called pickles or skin inflammation and is commonly found in people in the medical field.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a sign of excessive anxiety (OCD).
There are five critical occasions in a day when washing hands with soap is very important to reduce the spread of the disease through waste and mouth: after using the bathroom (precision or defecation), after cleaning from the bottom of the baby (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before and after eating food, and before and after preparing food.
Other occasions when washing hands correctly to avoid transmission of the disease include: before and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after animal waste or animal handling; and after handing over the litter.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of people living in homes wash their hands with soap.According to a 2014 study, this is the highest rate of child-to-child use in Saudi Arabia - 97 percent; the United States - 77 percent; and China has the lowest rate - 23 percent.
The mandatory "health protection program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the widespread promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes brushing your teeth twice a year, washing your hands with soap and florets daily.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The process of removing germs from the skin has been improved by mixing soap and detergents in the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to dissolution and increase the solution efficiency.
Just water is not enough to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, the cleaning is done with the help of the proper flow of water.
In solid soaps, bacteria may be present due to past use, due to reuse.
A few studies that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid-polluted soaps say that this transfer cannot happen because the bacteria leaves with the foam.
The CDC still says that "liquid soap without hands-on control is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted in the health-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended pesticides produces antibiotic-resistant organic organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps have such common antibacterial ingredients, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic life.
So if antibacterial soaps do not choose antibiotic-resistant, they will not be as effective as they have been said about.
In addition to sterile substances and skin-protection agents, the more sophisticated formulations can contain as many pathogenic bacteria as possible, such as pathogenic active benzene (acidic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), and skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, mental, plant extracts) as well as the University of the Philippines.
The hot water in which the hand is at ease is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, the natural oil, which absorbs soil and bacteria, to remove semi-hot, soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies say that semi-hot water is not effective for reducing germs by hand.
A hand sanitizer or hand anti-septic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand cleaning agents (also known as alcohol-based hand cleaning agents, disinfectant hand cleaning agents, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most isopropyl alcohols are based on ethanol mixed in a carbomer, such as carbomer (a multi-cellular mixture of acetic acid) into a gel-like substance or in a liquid, such as glycerin, for ease of use in fluids or for reducing the effect of alcohol dryness.
The addition of oxides on dissolved hydrogen increases anti-microbial activity. Hand sanitizers with alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol-containing sine teasers kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccinia, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-containing sanitizers containing 70% alcohol (a reduction of 3.5 logs, which is equivalent to 35 decibels) kill %99.97 bacteria 30 seconds after use, and 1 minute after use kills %99.99 to %99.999 (a reduction of 4 to 5) bacteria. Hand sanitizers are effective for many other bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for the Norovirus, or Norwalk, which is the most common cause of the infectious disease of small bowel inflammation.
Mix the front and back of both hands and the middle and end parts of all fingers for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with sanitizers, especially when hands are obviously contaminated.
The reason for the rapid use of such materials is their ease of use and the ability to quickly kill germs; however, they should not be considered an alternative to formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizer can lead to dry skin, unless the formula includes creams and/or skin-wetting items.
Glycerin and/or other creams can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experiments have shown that the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, including creams, makes the skin less brittle and dry, than soap or anti-microbial detergents.
In the case of a lot of sensitivity to various early diseases or alcohol, or due to the inclusion of alcoholic substances in the alcohol, there can sometimes be a complaint of allergies.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, they tended to be less prone to inflammatory diseases.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water-soluble compounds do not clean organic materials, they only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers for the prevention of the spread of many germs are not more effective than soap and water, because germs live on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is largely dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically they have not been very effective.
In recipes that have been used in recent days, unlike alcohol, overall anti-microbial functionality has been observed after use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to the reaction produced in the skin, its performance has been reduced.
In many low-income societies, people can't buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash and soil can be more effective than just water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or ash is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is a germ-killing agent because it forms an alkaline solution after contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or soil in case it is not soapy.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the correct handwashing procedure, to prevent the spread of the disease, includes the following:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
A lot of water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, while water temperature does not matter.
Rub the hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle places of the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research has found that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Hold for at least 20 seconds.
Matching creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and removes more germs than rubbing for a longer period of time.
Wash well with plenty of water.
Washing hands in the basin can re-contaminate the hands.
Clean with a dry towel or allow the air to dry.
Wet and damp hands can be easily re-contaminated. Commonly abandoned areas include the thumb, wrist, space between the fingers, and around the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-naked nail polish can be a source of germs.
Moisture lotions are usually recommended to protect hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Where potable water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided, such as indilating water from a hanging canister or lush vegetable with suitable holes, and/or using ash in developing countries when needed.
Tippy-tap is a simple technology with a jug hanging from a rope, and a lever moving from the foot, pouring a little bit of water over a tip of the hands and a teaspoon of soap.
Drying hands effectively is part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a debate about what is the most effective way to dry in public sanitizing rooms.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric dryers, which are often found in purification rooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, and it was sponsored by the paper towels industry, the European Tissue Symposium, which included paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and modern jet air dryers.
After washing hands and drying hands with a hot-air dryer, the rate of bacteria on finger mattresses increased by an average of 194%, and on palms by 254%.
Drying from the jet air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in the rate of bacteria on the fingers and 15% on the palms.
After washing hands and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads was reduced by an average of 76 percent and on the palms by 77 percent. The scientists also tested to determine whether all types of dry procedures have the potential to contaminate the environment of other washroom users and washrooms.
The jet air dryer, which emits air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs from the hands and the unit, and can contaminate other cleaners and cleaner environments up to 2 meters away.
The hot air hand dryer can spread the germs to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, a study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt examined different hand drying methods.
The following changes have occurred in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers, and dryers have been compared to paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water during travel, hand washing with sine-teased paper is an alternative.
Alcohol-based sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was made mandatory by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis after he discovered its effectiveness in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to the hospital staff so that when they forget, they are reminded to wash their hands.
According to one study, their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medically hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, use soap and water or gel in a special amount to make foam and rub every part of the hand.
The fingers of one hand are tied to the other.
If there is a mail in the fingernails, a hard hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is necessary to wash them well with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and to open the back door if needed).
This will prevent the hands from getting dirty again after they are applied to these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove the pathogenic microorganisms (the "germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine report, the rate of hand washing in the medical environment is also unacceptably low, with a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands before touching patients in the usual way, thus a means of transmitting germs.
According to a study, washing the right hands and following other simple methods reduces the rate of urinary tract infections by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the right way to wash hands and get hands in the health sector.
The agency's draft guidance on hand hygiene can be viewed on their website for public comment.
A related review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can test and validate the health and hygiene of the hand, if it has been mandated to do so.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are five ways to wash your hands:
Against the Blood/Blood.
prior to the outbreak of the disease, and
After taking care of the patient. The addition of sterile chemicals in the soap(“medicated or “antimicrobial” soap) to the disinfectant is found in the hand-washing agent.
There is a requirement for disinfection where there is a lot of antibiotic-resistant bacteria before surgery or where there is a lot of infection. For the operation to "crush" your hands, it is necessary to have a separate unit that can be opened and closed without touching the hand, washed with chlorhexidine or iodine, to dry after washing the hand.
All jewelry should be removed.
In this process, the hands are washed from the wrist to the elbows, usually 6-2 minutes.
No need to wait 10 minutes.
When water is being poured over the middle of the arm, be careful not to return to the hands.
When the washing of hands is complete, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after seeing the patient, or to apply disinfectant materials to the hands.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has found that the highest benefits of hand hygiene came from the first 20% washing, and that when this rate was increased from 35%, there was little additional benefit.
The use of simple soaps was three times more effective than antibacterial soaps in the context of transmission of bacterial infectious disease in the diet. Alcohol-based solution and antibacterial soaps were found to have a 30 second hand rubbing rate compared to antibacterial soaps.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solvents to remove the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spurs from the hands. In health-related places, if the hand hygiene is improved, it will require the teaching of staff for hand washing, and the oral cavity for alcohol-based hand washing.
More research is needed to determine how effective the measures are in a variety of health settings.
Hand washing with soap in developing countries is considered to be a means of obtaining low cost, good health, and even good nutrition,
However, the lack of constant supply of water, soap and hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces is a major challenge for all people to adopt a global hand washing habit.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is very rare to have a hand washing unit near a private or public toilet, although there are many low-cost forms of hand washing.
However, the lower hand washing rate can also be due to the firmness of the habit rather than the lack of soap and water.
Incentives and advertising of hand washing with soap can affect decision-making, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and create far-reaching changes in the behavior of the population.
Monitoring and testing is necessary to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that LMICs are more effective at working in a particular community, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One form of hand washing promotion in schools is the “three-star approach” by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take other health measures to ensure that they have simple and low-cost measures.
When they reach the minimum standard, schools can reach the second and then the third stars.
Making handwashing spaces can be part of a campaign to reduce the number of diseases and deaths in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness of this promotional series, aimed at behavioural change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of hand washing emoji.
Some research has considered the overall cost of hand washing to be low by ignoring DALYs in developing countries.
However, according to one review, promoting hand washing with soap is much less expensive than managing water and its drainage.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those who are in unsafe conditions, such as mothers who have just given birth or injured soldiers in hospital - was first recognized by the first two hypnosis physicians in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the second in Flanders.
At that time, most people still believed that the cause of infection was bad breath.
In 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promoted more intensive hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The swine flu in 2009 and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted awareness in many countries that hand washing with soap is essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "clean hand washing techniques" were hung in places outside the public toilets, in the toilet of office buildings, and at airports in Germany.
The saying "Washing one's hands" means that a person declares not to take responsibility for something or to say something.
This proverb relates to the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expressed his disapproval of Jesus' decision to be hanged on the cross, but it later became a proverb in English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to keep washing her hands in an attempt to clear a thought-provoking stain, which reveals a glimmer of conscience for the crime of killing her own husband.
It has also been observed that people after remembering or considering unethical practices, wash their hands more often than other people, and attach great importance to hand washing utensils.
Furthermore, those who wash their hands after such thoughts tend to be less involved in other "clean" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions also suggest hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e., the use of soap and water without washing hands, is characteristic of many religions: for example, Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> faith, Hinduism, Judaism, Torah, Nettletism, Lavabo in Christianity, and some subsequent practices, such as the practice of washing hands. Religions suggest hand hygiene.
It is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Controlling the Risks of Workplaces for COVID-19
Controlling the risks in workplaces for COVID-19 refers to implementing occupational safety and health measures to protect against the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of risks in the workplace depends on the workplace and the nature of the work, the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and in workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk jobs are those that have minimal professional contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic measures are recommended to prevent infection, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining respiratory etiquette, and keeping the work environment clean and free of germs.
Medium exposure risk jobs are those that are in contact with people who are not known to be infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by social transmission and international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, the work environment in a densely populated area, and more retail spaces.
In addition to the basic infection protection measures for the cluster, the risk-control measures include high-performance air filters, sneezing protection, and personal protective equipment if a person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA considers the appearance of healthcare and mortuary workers in front of a person suffering from or suspected of COVID-19 to be a greater risk, much higher exposure risk if workers collect or handle samples from an airsol-producing procedure or a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Appropriate measures will have to be taken to control the risk for these workers, such as rooms with negative air flow pressure, and personal protective equipment depending on the nature of the work.
There are many possible effects of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the workplace.
Workers may be absent due to the risk of getting sick, the safety of others, or the fear of being exposed to the disease.
Trading practices may change, both in terms of demand for goods and also in terms of the acquisition of those goods (such as purchases at low altitude times, or delivery or driver-through facilities).
Finally, there may be a disruption in shipments from geographically severe COVID-19 affected areas, with a plan to prepare for and respond to infectious disease to guide safety actions.
Plans identify risk levels associated with various workplaces and employment tasks, including sources of disclosure, risk factors arising from home and community setting, and individual workers' risk factors such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines emergency plans for the situation arising as a result of these containment methods and outbreaks, which are necessary to deal with these risks.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious disease can be the subject of national or regional proposals.
To reduce transfers between staff for the purposes of a response to an epidemic, to protect those who are at risk due to poor health complications, and to reduce the ill effects in relation to business activities and supplies.
The intensity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the response.
The risk control classification framework is very active in occupational safety and health, so that the group risks are effectively controlled.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, there are control mechanisms that are most effective, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
The controls set in place are meant to separate employees from work-related risks, without relying on their behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution to the application.
Administrative control refers to a change in the work policy and procedure, which requires action from the worker or owner.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some manifestations.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks posed to workers, properly installed, if applied (e.g., a salinity taking device), continuously and properly worn, permanently painful and altered, whatever is needed, if properly removed, cleaned and stored or destroyed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk jobs are in minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
The basic measures recommended for all workplaces to prevent infection include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory etiquettes including coughing and sneezing, covering the mouth, providing tissue and disinfection, talking on the phone or arranging frequent attendance if needed.
The identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a worrying step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay at home until symptoms such as fever, fever, or any other symptoms are eliminated without using fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs are those that require close or continuous contact with people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19 from a distance of six feet (1.8 m), but may be affected by community transmission around the business or by SARS-CoV-2, or because the person has had a recent international transmission of COVID-19 on a large scale.
It also includes personnel who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, and in the workplace, in order to the workplace, in order to control of safety, and safety, and safety.
The use of breathing apparatus is rare among workers in this group of at-risk people.
If a person falls ill on a plane, it means adequate control to protect workers and other passengers, to isolate the sick person from others 6 feet away, to allocate one member of the staff to the patient, and to present a face mask to the sick person or to tell the patient to cover their mouth and hands with tissue while coughing or sneezing.
When approaching a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew of the ship should wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment, if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be destroyed in a bag made for this purpose, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk-taking involves delaying travel in case of illness, and self-isolation and fever or any other symptoms.
The CDC recommends short-term closures for schools and child care centers to ensure that if an infected person has come to the school building, even if he or she has not spread the virus, it should be cleaned or disinfected.
When there is a small to medium-sized virus transmission, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or canceling meals in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between desks, limiting the use of arrival and departure times, avoiding unnecessary visits to the office, and avoiding children with disabilities.
When there is a significant amount of migration in the local community, in addition to the social distancing strategy, the long-term closure of schools may also be considered. Law enforcement personnel who are carrying out their daily activities are considered to be at immediate health risk, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers, who are certain or suspected to be in contact with people with COVID-19, are recommended to follow the same guidelines for emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the alarm, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reuse, and follow standard implementation procedures for using and containing PPE and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, some health centers and dead-house workers are at high or very high risk of exposure.
Health delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers in high-risk jobs who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
They become highly exposed when workers take aerosol-making action, or collect or manage samples of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the aerosol-making process, the insertion of the groove, the procedures related to the cough, the examination of the throat ducts, some procedures and inspections related to the teeth, or the collection of invasive samples.
High exposure risk jobs in the morgue include workers who develop dead bodies of people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional set-up controls, including separate rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-making procedures are being followed.
Special negative-pressure airflow devices may be appropriate in some health centers and dead cells.
The samples should be touched under biosafety level 3 safety measures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be quarantined in specific waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends device respirators for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from known patients or a suspect of SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-making operations.
The NIOSH-approved N95 filtering device should be used in the light of a comprehensive and written safety respirator program in the United States, including proper testing, training, and medical testing.
Other types of devices can provide better respiratory protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend covering up completely, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted from the body's tissues.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks in place of the entrance screen for staff.
People who are caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-forming procedures as they gather respiratory samples, are recommended by the WHO to wear surgical masks, glasses, or face shields, gowns, and gloves.
If the aerosol-making procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Knowing that the global delivery of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, only allowing them to enter the room that are directly caring for the COVID-19 patient, the use of PPE is necessary for specific tasks, the use of the same device while caring for many patients with the same disease, the use of respirators, the use of PPE without the supervision and management of the supply chain.

We have a lot of special events this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is one that has made it clear that humans are universally connected and we have a responsibility to each other.
We don't have an example of this kind of challenge before, but we are well aware that our best response is global empathy, cooperation, and social construction that lives in the soul of this institution.
The feelings of friendship and attention that we've seen in email, phone calls, and chat in all of our co-workers are all testaments to how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I couldn't be more grateful and feel proud that you are all my car.
Last week, someone complimented me on my work.
He reminded me how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and how strong it is for this delicate resource that online is available to everyone.
Your work has made it possible, whether you are with the sites or our cars that are paid for or our community is protected.
The world needs information, and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes over the coming week to see how we work together.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robyn previously expressed, our point of view and schedule for the coming days and months was the c-team meeting last night to discuss.
In this conversation, we looked at what would be the most appropriate response to what we are facing and how to keep the organization on its feet at the time.
With all seriousness, we wanted to end the tension for a long time and promote our mission.
If you want to download.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, to order,
We are not announcing a holiday - if you can work according to the usual hours, the mission can bring you to use.
However, nothing can be said about the world at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a bargain, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't track your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
We don't need to say that, but we do.
Don't require sick days or PTOs - just tell your manager and help rebuild your team's calendar and schedule, making sure all aspects of the job are met.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, notify Bryan within the T&C Ops, T&C can help with support and ensure that the administration pays proper attention to your situation).
Working hours will be paid in full.
We have said this before, and we are reiterating our responsibilities to our contractors and hourly staff.
Each person will be paid according to their hours of meeting during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people work in the world around them to change their minds.
What we can do is incredibly beneficial, especially in times like these.
Again, this is all for your personal safety.
All we have to say is that you talk to your manager, this will give us an idea of what to expect from you and then decide things accordingly.
A task is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (among others) work hard, which may require additional support.
We examine current objectives with all areas and change our focus to support what is important to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we'll just focus our attention on all the most important projects.
Slowing down at this time will not hurt us later.
We are not planning that once this pandemic is over, we will "take care" of it.
You are not expected to work extra time to meet deadlines, which are currently unreal.
We acknowledge that circumstances have changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and timelines.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
To set expectations for our new reality and day-to-day working hours, we plan to schedule our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We want to expand our 2019-2020 plan to create a budget that allows workers to change their work preferences, and also allows their loved ones to adjust to a situation where they want to work for less time.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the planned work and pressure throughout the organization.
We will be introducing our plan to the board next week and will notify the delegations and teams about the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for leading the APC team.
Office status, appearance and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that one of our SF-based friends could be infected with COVID-19.
However, despite the extreme caution, we conducted an anti-virus operation at the San Francisco office to clean up all surfaces.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant solution to clean the arms of the head and the spine at every level, which allows access to our chest.
The building is using the products of its own design protocol to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be in perfect condition at this time as soon as we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in Vwork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with all DC office staff members and all of us.
Until last week, our DC office moved to a remote location, in line with the San Francisco Joint Directive.
As some of our NYC residents know, we're also renting out a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
We know from our old age that it can be some adjustment and we want to give you some advice.
The duration of the meetings can be extended to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer seats will be needed, consider how to divide them on different days.
Make the meeting clear as to each agenda, and send out the content first.
Make the video by default, with facilities such as Google Docs and Zoom for direct collaboration and communication.
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, one should monitor the discussion for questions and follow up the list of speakers and help someone take a note (or make a note with mutual assistance).
If you need technical assistance, send an email.
Use your profits to pay for the sinks.
Join the <0x23>Remotes channel in Slack to talk about distributed work with my colleagues.
The HR operations team is considering webinar-based aerogonomics guidance to support distributed work across the foundation.
Last week, we called on all recipients of social benefits to cancel Wikimedia's public events, such as Eid al-Adha, until the World Health Organization announces an end to the pandemic.
They should be aware that we recognize that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may enable them to complete the activities of their accepted cooperation and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down these obligations.
In the coming week, we will follow additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and topical social conferences.
The general feelings of the entire global community are sad about this disruption but are satisfied with the clear ability to focus on our own communities, the Wikimedia community, and so on.
Going forward, CRT is working on creating a web page on MetaWiki to provide opportunities for the community to track and monitor their communication.
Stay in touch with COVID-19.
We will also arrange an invitation to your calendar for a special meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share the latest information, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are here to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information from this email and other necessary information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will store the latest and all other information on this page in one place.
We are working to establish regular contacts with staff members who are currently living in countries that are heavily affected.
If you have a trip, an event, an important work area, or a coverage challenge or anything else you need help with, please don't hesitate to work with CRT and get notifications.
We are here to provide you with the support and support you need.
If you have a secret or sensitive matter, please email Brian Jodan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition at this point, that our actions and responsibilities will need to be thrown away in a way that we have never seen before.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to help each other to continue to work, to support our movement with the support it needs, and the service they rely on to the world.
When the time comes, we will be there waiting for you.
Now, helping each other is the need of the hour and taking time out for important work that will come in a few weeks, but possibly in a few months.
To do this, we need all of you, and that is why it is important that you take care of yourself and your family so that you are in the best condition when needed.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't wash your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J. Dorian D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L., Lent L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and the rest of the team leadership (Grant I, Header W.), Jim V., Jeanne U, Lisa S., Rubin A., Ryan M., and Toby N.).
B. angiotensin - enzyme 2 changer (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer layer of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 reduces the amount of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) associated with angiotensin II and makes it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease by increasing the amount of angiotensin (1-7).
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of enzyme that contains methalonase that is found on the surface of endothelial and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptides M2 domain and a C-terminal collagen renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I protein, with its curvature active domain elongated on the surface of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
The domain outside the cells of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sedatives, and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream which is eventually excreted through the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is primarily linked to the lung-type II vascular cells, small intestinal invertebrates, arterial and virions endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
The effect of ACE2M RNA is also found in the brain's outer hemisphere, body texture, small finger to the bottom of the skull, brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an inverse balance of ACE.
ACE inhibits the I hormone in the blood vessels of Inhibition II.
In turn, the ACE2 carboxyl terminal separates amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and binds it to hydrolysis-Vasodilator Angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Hle-Val-Tyr-Phe).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides, including [DES-ARG9]-Bredikinin, alumin, neurotensin, denorphene A, and glycine.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of natural amino acids carrying SLC6A19 membranes and is involved in mental illness of the brain.
As a protein transducer, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in the cells of a few coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the restriction of downshifting on the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the spike S1 protein cells of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 causes the contents of a cell's cell membrane to be smelted inwards and transmissible within both viruses and enzyme cells.
This process of intervention also requires prioritization of spiroline by representative serine protease TMPRSS2, which is ongoing as a recurrent treatment under current research. This has led some to conclude that with a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells, it may be easier to fight off the disease.
However, a number of professional societies and organizations have advised not to continue general ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia in those patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and movement heart failure, has also decreased.
ACE inhibitors are also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related deaths, although its results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human papillomavirus ACE2 (rhACE2) is a modern treatment for severe lung injury, and it appears that it will improve the supply of hemodynamics and oxygen along with acute respiratory distress symptoms of a lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the action begins in 30 minutes, except for the 24-hour effect.
Numerous results suggest that rhACE2 may be a better medicine for people with intolerance to the classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in diseases where the circulation of angiotensin II is increased - a high level of rhACE2 is diagnosed during clinical trials to treat acute respiratory distress.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile applications that help communicate during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example the process of identifying people ("contacts") who have been in contact with an infected person.
A number of such applications have been created or proposed in several areas and constituencies in collaboration with the government.
A number of application frameworks have been developed to find communication.
There have been concerns about privacy, especially about the system used by the app's users to find the geographic location.
A less-intrusive alternative involves the use of Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would collaborate on integrating Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to find out if they were in contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. The app called TraceTogether is being used in Singapore.
The app was created by a local IT community, which was released as an independent source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called “Stop Corona!” that can detect the proximity of potential victims and provide an immediate response to health authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-finding app is in the next stage of development and will be available for launch within a week - a similar application in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and Bluetooth protocol - Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19-infected patients based in Moscow, to ensure that people do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has presented a number of potential practical challenges in app-based systems, including false positives and low effectiveness, if the application is limited to a small segment of the population.
Facing concerns about the spread of the wrong or harmful "coronavirus" app, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related applications to their app store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Confidentiality advocates have voiced their concerns about the myriad of surveillance restrictions on the coronavirus app, particularly on whether the surveillance arrangements set up to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed once the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance arrangements.
The government has announced a series of measures for the following projects:
Monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and monitoring should be carried out for a specific period of time.
The use of the data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data protection and anonymity will be protected and security based on evidence must be disclosed;
Digital surveillance should be avoided to make excessive discrimination and unimportant;
The sharing of data with a third party must be made clear under the law;
Security measures will have to be taken against abuses, and citizens will have the right to respond to abuses;
All "related partners" will need meaningful participation, including public health experts and non-critical groups, the German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohan Greensin) (RSF) also released surveillance lists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan is to remove the monitoring mechanism from its operating system device, when it is not needed, and resolve the issue of constant monitoring.
Some countries used a network-based chance palace monitoring system instead of the app, which eliminates both the need to download the application and the ability to avoid monitoring.
A network-based monitoring system was approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions, which have access to unprivileged palace data, have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems connected to the main servers require access to the personal data of the host; a number of privacy protection systems have been created that use only the main servers to communicate with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to trace contacts.
Instead of using an excellent application, the system collects surveillance information from a variety of sources, including monitoring data and card-to-card data in a mobile device, and collects all of them and generates notices via text messages for potentially affected people.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the opportunity palace information publicly available to inform potential contacts, something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes in the privacy laws of the information when the MERS epidemic broke out in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries such as Germany have also considered both central and privacy protection systems.
No details have been released as of April 6, 2020.
Surveillance of privacy-protected communications is a better idea, with a long history of research literature dating back at least as far as 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) use that allows users to access the Palace from other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is an integrated effort that consists of both central and non-central methods, and is not a standalone protocol. In non-central protocols: non-central privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary number of contacts (TCN,fka event contact number, CEN), sensitive privacy protocols and other mobile communications protocols.
Identifiable personal data in these protocols does not go unnoticed by the device and all combinations are on the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Laboratory is developing secure pathways, a platform to use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research by Kartas Abid "Apps Gone Rogue: Retaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" which was released in March 2020. A second such attempt is the Safe Trace Platform by Engma MPC, a company that developed the privacy technology that was originally set up in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising on the privacy of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that had the same vision and broad-based protocols to reduce dispersal so as to enable surveillance and alert apps to become globally interoperable, an important aspect of achieving mass adoption.
On April 9, 2020, Singapore's government announced that it had made the Bluetooth application, an application used by its government, free of charge.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile platform control companies, Google and Apple, announced a move to track communications, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and security privacy encryption.
He also published descriptions of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three steps:
The implementation of these protocols will enable governments to issue state-of-the-art security privacy applications for coronavirus detection.
Through the integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple intend to resolve this persistent monitoring issues by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way when the threat is resolved.
Altering B's (also known as changing a drug's purpose, reproducing a profile, changing a job, or changing a treatment) is the replacement or use of a medication approved for the treatment of one disease rather than the use of the drug for the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is an online scientific research that is currently underway to investigate the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19.
Other aspects of the research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of rubella plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 able-drug proteins, each of which has a number of molecular sites.
The analysis of these molecular sites provides a proper plan to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most promising target protein of SARS-CoV-2 is papain, like RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.

Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Science for the prevention and treatment of Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease. Subsequently, Gilead Science quickly discovered that Remdesivir had anti-viral activity against a number of filo, fumio, paramexo and corona-viruses in vitro.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the propagation of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several such clinical trials, including two administered by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with low-illness and the other for people with severe disease, are available.
For serious patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized, there are three clinical trials of vitamin C in the vein; two satisfactorily controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italian).

The B.A. COVID-19 vaccine is a fake vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five candidates for the vaccine were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, there was a major outbreak around the world, which led to considerable investment and research activities in the development of a vaccine.
Several agencies are using the advertised saliva to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CEP's indispensable measures for vaccine development are fast, enabling manufacturers, deployments on a large-scale and global scale.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I safety studies include several major platform goals:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I producers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (Creators and vaccine candidates of stage I: ear sinobiology, adenovirus type 5 vectors)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milkin Institute), and another 37 have announced but little public information about them (assuming they are in the planning phase or are in the early design phase).
Phase I-II experiments are early safety and sensitivity checks, usually without order, controlled by the harmless substance of the drug, and at multiple sites, while more precise, effective doses are prescribed.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of vaccine testing to prevent disease, while monitoring the side effects on maximum doses.
Of the 79 candidates for the vaccine in active preparation (certified as early as April 2020), 74 were not yet diagnosable on humans (yet in "pre-medical" research).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would trigger an immune response by genetically modifying viral proteins.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM's supercomputers, which will be pooled with Hewlett-Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits besides the disease they want to avoid.
In Australia, 4,170 medical personnel are being enrolled for another randomised trial.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be safe or effective in the production stages.
Preliminary research to test vaccine efficacy using specific animal samples of COVID-19, such as ACE2-binary mice, other laboratory animals and non-human high-end creatures, identify the need for biosafety level 3 measures to deal with the virus directly, and international coordination to ensure standard protection procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine or treatment for SARS that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions around the world.
When MERS was first developed, it was thought that existing SARS research would be a useful model in the treatment and vaccine development of MERS-CoV disease.
As of March 2020, a MERS vaccine (DNA-based) was one that had completed clinical trials of Phase I on humans and the other three continued, all of which were vector-borne viral vaccines, two antiviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-Vac.
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and its vaccine is already available.
The patents, shown in various posts on social media, point to the existing patents of genetic sequences and vaccines and other branches of the coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, swelling in the throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
From appearance to onset of symptoms, it usually takes five days but can last from two to fourteen days.
Although the symptoms of the disease are usually mild, some go as far as viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 districts and regions, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered - mainly from close contact with people, often in the form of droplets in the mouth when coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Although similar droplets come out when breathing, they often fall on the ground or on the floor, instead of being able to spread the disease from long distances.
People can also get the disease by touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands after touching the affected surface.
The virus can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious disease within three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread even before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
The use of the mask is advised to those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and those with underlying health conditions.
There is a difference in the proposal for the general public to wear a mask, some officials are against its use, some advise its use and some are calling it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all the regions of the World Health Organization.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or have symptoms such as fever, wheezing, tachycardia, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, frequent chest pain or pressure, mental alertness, difficulty waking up, and blue of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is advised.
Symptoms of the disease such as sneezing, nosebleeds or sore throat can also be seen in the upper part of the respiratory tract.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
In China, there have been only a few cases of heart attack and stroke.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, excess organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to several days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms of the disease will do so within 11.5 days of being infected.
These affected people without symptoms are not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can be contagious.
The proportion of people infected with the disease is currently unknown and is being studied, where the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has reported that 20% of all cases confirmed during hospital stay are asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily cases from April 1; 130 (78 percent) of the 166 infected patients on that day were without symptoms at the time of testing.
The viral load can be high in both Tuk and Bulgaria.
High-pitched sounds are more pronounced than normal sounds.
A study in Singapore found that without Dh<0xC3><0xA1>npe Kwansi's droplets have the ability to go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioresol transmission may be possible and samples of viral RNA have been found positive in the receptors in the hallway outside the individuals' rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolize respiratory conditions and result in airborne spread.
The virus is most contagious when symptoms appear in people; and if the spread of the virus is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is reduced.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says it is now not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, with one person usually infecting two to three people.
In particular, one day on virus cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper were found to be viable.
However, it varies in terms of humidity and temperature.
If soaps and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products neutralize the virus's thickening protective layer, as well as they clear the virus from skin and other surfaces.
The other ones, Hesse Benzkonium Chloride and Chlorhexidine Gluconate (a surgical disinfection) were less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample saw the highest viral load, and the sixth patient saw the highest amount of virus in the second day of testing.
The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe novel respiratory disease coronavirus, first detected in three people in Wuhan with pneumonia with acute respiratory illnesses.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which tear its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because viruses access these host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most commonly found in the species II-type moth cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a certain level of sugar called "cell" (piplomer) to bind to ACE2, and enters the host cell.
In China's Wuhan city, 12% of those hospitalized were found to have a severe heart attack and are often found in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to diseases of the immune system during inflammation and disease progression throughout the body, but severe heart muscle injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors.
2ACE is more visible in the heart and is involved in the function of the heart.
In patients with the intensive care unit infected with COVID-19, high incidences of blood clotting in the arteries (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) were observed and may be associated with poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has side effects for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory tract endometrial cells, severe COVID-19-infected patients have more inflammatory symptoms than usual affecting the body.
In particular, T-cells with sickening SM-CSF secreting were found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6 exacerbation and severe lung diseases in patients with COVID-19.
There have also been reports of lymphocyte interference at the time of post-mortem.
The WHO has published several methods of testing for the disease.
The standard method of experiments is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on breath-respiratory samples obtained from the incubator; however, nasal or saliva samples can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples to be taken in two weeks and the immediate importance of the results is reduced.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate a variant of the coronavirus and published a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which detect active infectious disease and whether or not a person has been infected in the past) were in the preparatory stages, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience of testing showed accuracy only from 60% to 70%.
The FDA approved the first test center for end-of-month use in the United States on March 21, 2020, and the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University issued diagnostic guidelines for the detection of the epidemic, taking into account medical properties and pandemic risk.
In the early infectious disease, a bilateral multi-house, glass opacity is covered by, improper, and later-divided discoloration is common.
As the disease progresses, full dominance, crucifix pung (the thickness of the pubic cover with variegated lips such as braided hair) and stability may appear.
Some statistics about the microbiome and pathophysiology of COVID-19 are available.
The main desirable results on the post-mortem are:
Macroscopy: inflammation of the lung membrane, inflammation of the cover heart, stability of the lungs and inflammation of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: a swelling of the lungs, a high buildup of pneumocytes, large abnormal pneumocytes, rupture of lymph cells with inflammation and the formation of multicellular giant sized cells.
Severe pneumonia: Low back pain of the butt with a loss of vision (DAD).
D.A. fear is the manifestation of acute respiratory distress symptoms (ARDS) and a severe lack of oxygen in the body.
Pneumonia: the organization of the removal of alveolar caves and pulmonary basalts in the anterior pituitary
Bleeding: Blood clotting in the veins (DIC); reaction of white and red blood.
To reduce the chances of infection, precautions include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and washing for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and recommending the use of the inside of the mouth if the tissue is not available.
Proper hygienic use of the hands after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings to limit the spread of the virus from people who do not show symptoms.The social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact with large groups of victims by closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions and canceling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also require people to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from each other.
Since vaccines are not expected before 2021, one of the main points of contracting COVID-19 is to reduce the highest levels of the pandemic called "flattening the curve."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are obviously dirty, before eating and after brushing, coughing, or sneezing.
It further suggests that at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO forms two formulas for local production.
In these formations, anti-microbial activity, produced by ethanol and esopronol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacteria; it is "not an active substance for beneficial germs in the hands."
Glycerol is poured as a medicine.
People have been organized with supportive care, including sali treatment, taking help from oxygen, and supporting other important affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected wear a simple mask.
Non-crystalline membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory obstruction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and a better diet have been proposed to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the epidemic, the WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
Violent individuals and lung doctors in the United States have compiled treatment proposals from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts suggested paracetamol(macetaminophen) as an important drug in place of ibuprofen.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of the virus spreading, especially in the medical environment when there is a medical procedure that causes the process of ventilating, such as a shovel or a hand dryer.
For medical staff caring for people infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends general precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for airborne germs, as well as keeping the person in the Airborne Infection Room (AIIR).
The recommended equipment is: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. The device is preferred (instead of face masks) when available.
The N95 respirator has been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has allowed the mask to be used only under emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but they do not guarantee the effect of use against any particular unapproved biological agent.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using a face shield or a homemade mask, as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 are often not so bad that they need mechanical shocks or replacements, but a few percent of patients need them.
The type of respiratory support is being actively studied in people hospitalized with COVID-19-related respiratory failure, with some evidence that the evapotranspiration can be avoided with high-flow nasal cannula or bilateral positive ventilation.
It is not known whether either of these two seriously ill people have the same benefit.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanization when available because this procedure limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high flow nasal cannulas. Severe disease is more common in older adults (those who are older than 60 and especially in those who are older than 80).
There is not enough beds per person in developed countries, which limits the ability of the health system to handle an increase in people infected with COVID-19 who need to be hospitalized.
According to one study, 5% were admitted to the intensive care unit in China, 2.3% needed mechanized ventilation, and 1.4% died.
30% of people infected with COVID-19 in China are finally admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 increases and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
The pressure-control mode and high PEEP-capable ventilators need to minimize the risk of loss of oxygen delivery and ventilator-related lung damage and chest air tightness.
There will not be a lot of PPE available on older ventilators.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it may take up to 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that volunteers take part in experiments on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has allowed artificially recovered individuals' plasma to be used experimentally if a person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not gone through medical studies to show itself safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his name and ID number.
This app can detect "close contact" using surveillance numbers and therefore the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local medical officials. Mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, tracking mobile phones, and big data analytics on artificial intelligence are used to find affected people and people who come into contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who should have coronavirus.
The measures were taken to ensure quarantine and to protect those who may be in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared data collected from mobile phone space with the German federal government's agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to conduct research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
The Italian regional health authority said it had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40 percent of people are now roaming."
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with 42,000 candidates.
Estonian President Christie Kjollide also voiced his support for a creative solution against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of self-pandemic.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Excessive social distancing, isolation, health concerns, stress and economic downturns are a complete disaster for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild side effect with or without symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as a common fever.
Patients usually recover in two weeks, while patients with severe or serious illnesses recover in three to six weeks.
Other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, may also pose a serious risk to pregnant women from COVID-19, but data on COVID-19 is not available.
In severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly turn into acute respiratory illness (ARDS) that can lead to respiratory failure, body mold, or multiple organ failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include body mold, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Unusual blood clotting, especially in 6% of COVID-19 patients, was found to have an increased blood clotting period, while kidney failure was seen in 4% of patients in the group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 showed an increased amount of liver enzymes (tranaminases).
According to the same document, the time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five spent in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death among patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median period from the appearance of early symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full range was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
After post-mortem lung medical examination, the damage was seen to be spread in small oils with fibromyusoid fibers for the presence of air in the lungs.
Changes in animal virus cell disease have been seen in nematocysts.
The image of the lungs is similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory distress (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8% of deaths were observed due to troponin or elevated heart levels.
According to the United States' March statistics, 89% of hospitalized patients already had some form of the disease.The availability of medical resources and the region's socio-economics could also have an impact on mortality rates.
The mortality rate varies due to regional variations, but it can also be due to difficulties in the procedure.
The low number of patients can lead to death.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of pre-existing diseases, means that the current mortality rate is low.
The prevalence of severe symptoms of COVID-19 among smokers was 1.4 times higher and the need for intensive care or mortality was 2.4 times higher than non-smokers.
The management of Hong Kong Hospital saw a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung inspections indicated organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of extreme care symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known if it had long-term immunity in people recovering from past pandemics.
Immunity is likely to be seen based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have also been cases in which coronavirus positive results have been reported again after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be getting worse because of the long-lasting infectious disease rather than re-infectious disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an infectious disease from animals.
The exact source of the outbreak is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in the Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first case of the appearance of symptoms occurred on December 1, 2019.
Official publications of the WHO reported on 8 December 2019 being the first date of the onset of the disease.
There are usually a number of steps to determine the victim's death.
These numbers vary from region to region and over time, and would affect the number of tests performed, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the onset of the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex, and overall health factors.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and U07.2 to medical or pandemic deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed confirmed cases.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality and incidence ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9 (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among confirmed cases, and the pandemic mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among infected (verified and unverified).
These figures do not cover a specific time period and cover a specific population from illness to case resolution.
Although antibodies do not appear in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In Italy, a small village with a population of 4,600, Castiglio de Ada, 80 (1.7%) has already died.
In Gangtok, the disease spread due to celebrations of Catholic Christians, and spread to younger people, causing a relatively low mortality rate, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified in this way.
Germany's health care system is not broken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as measured by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) people have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rates of the pandemic are different for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk in men occurs after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women only ends at 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this sexual difference is not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be one of the causes.
Immunological variations based on gender, low tobacco use in women and men, and other diseases in men, such as high blood pressure at a young age, can lead to increased mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 percent of infected people were men and 72 percent of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not been able to find gender-related statistics for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
The greater percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19."
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to the days from Corona, VI to Virus, D to Disease, and 19 to the day when the first event appeared: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (China, for example), type of animal, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a symptom of severe respiratory illness.
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both disease and varicose veins are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses."
During the initial outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus."
In January 2020, the WHO proposed nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as the interim names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against using the location name in the name of disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the potential limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are rolling up medical equipment such as needles and ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator's valve, and the seller was unable to provide it in the required time, a local artisan copied it and made the required 100 valve overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misunderstandings about disease onset, duration, prevention, treatment and other initiatives emerged and quickly spread on the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral growth in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved for the treatment of the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry experts.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity experiment" to assess the effects of treatment from four current antiviral compounds with the highest efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same means to enter ACE2 human cells.
Three vaccines are being tested.
The goal is to develop a vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, should create an immediate immune response in the human body against the new disease of COVID-19.
Another strategy is to develop a vaccine aimed at sensitizing the immune system against certain components of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the focus of such research is the S spike protein, which helps the virus enter the enzymes of ACE2.
The third strategy is the nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccines, the novel way of developing vaccines).
These strategies will be tested for the safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccine - the first clinical trial of the vaccine was launched on 16 March 2020 on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine consists of harmless genetic code that was copied from the virus that causes the disease.The antibody-dependent booster in the preparation of the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed as a challenge, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven experiments were testing a drug that is already approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research consists of re-recommended antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir expected to be reported in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review was underway for candidates to develop and use a COVID-19 vaccine. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are under examination, including Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/retinoin and lopinavir/retinoin that were combined with the interstitial beta-respiron replication.
As of March 2020, there is temporary evidence of efficacy from Remdesivir.
Medical improvements were observed in patients treated with reduced use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, we are still waiting for a review of the research.
The medical administration of Korea and China suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although one gram of a daily dose is recommended, reminds that double doses of the drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization to use hydrochloroquine and chloroquine at its discretion for doctors who are engaged in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that high levels of Roboviron are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitazoxanide has been suggested for further vivo studies after demonstrating less concentration in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the ACE2 receptor interacts with the receptor by inhibiting the necessary transmembrane protease of SARS-CoV-2 by means of the precursor to SARS-CoV-2.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have major inhibitions in studies with or without azithromycin which has prevented the medical class from accepting the treatment without further study.
Cytokine strom can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine is characterized by an anti-cytokine strom. After a brief study, Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission.
Italy is undergoing a phase 2 randomised trial in Italy after people with severe illness showed positive results.
The combined serum ferritin blood test to identify the causative kinase strom is intended to counteract such advances, which are considered to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release disease, which is associated with a different cause, namely CART cell treatment, the FDA approved the Misinterleukin 6 receptor antagonist based on past-style studies.
To date, there is no random, convincing evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment against CRS.
Clean and concentrated antibodies, produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 disease, are being researched as inactivated vaccinations of an inactivated vaccine for those who need it.
This strategy was tested with inconclusive results for SARS.
Viral neutropenia is an expected procedure that can lead to the defense against inactivated antibody treatment SARS-CoV-2.
However, other procedures, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment, for example, the use of assisted monoclonal antibodies, are being worked on.
The production of rheumatic substances, which are the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contain specific antibodies to the virus, can be developed for early use.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Lang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, was infected after raising awareness about the spread of the virus and died of COVID-19.
