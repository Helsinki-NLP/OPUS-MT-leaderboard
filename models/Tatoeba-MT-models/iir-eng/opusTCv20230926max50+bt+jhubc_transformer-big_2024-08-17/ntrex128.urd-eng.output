Welsh AMs Worried About ‘Looking Like Fools’
Some AMs are found to be disturbed by a suggestion that their address should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This confusion has arisen due to the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Throughout the political scene, AMs are worried that this could lead to their ridicule.
A Labour AM said that their group is worried that its voice gets mixed with Twp and Pwp.
In Welsh, twp means crazy and pwp means dog.
A plaid AM said their group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group has an "open mind" about the name change, however said there is a short verbal leap from MWP to Mad.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the English letter u of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a legal draft to introduce the name change, said: "Any address to which the members of the Assembly are to be addressed is undoubtedly to be decided by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, showing broad support for calling the Assembly Welsh Parliament.
In the case of AMs, the Commission has endorsed the members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMPs, but the MWP has received the most support in public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but reaching a consensus for presiding officer Alan Jones could be a headache, who is expected to submit a legal draft of the changes within weeks.
Legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules regarding the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will vote in the final vote on the issue during the legislative debate on which address they should be called.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of East Macedonia."
Public opinion polls have been organized to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which named one of its provinces Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name expresses its claim over its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership efforts in the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President George Ivanov, who is opposed to the name change, has said he will ignore it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zuran Zaif, have argued that the change of name is simply the cost of membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silent while churches in Harlem faced difficulties.
Mr. Adams said that historically, whenever I spoke to the old people, they used to say that there was a church in every corner.
Not one of them today.
He said it's important to keep the bar open.
Today's people have come together in different ways.
Bars are no longer the seats of the palaces where people used to live regularly.
As far as churches are concerned, they are concerned that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect, and they will stand where they left off.
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium apartment buildings that would be filled with people who would not help the remaining places of worship in the area.
He said that the overwhelming majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white and will play a role in the early closure of these churches because it is unlikely that those who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white groups before becoming a black metropolis of Harlem, a metropolitan community a decade after St. Martin's in 1870.
The original white-dominated Methodist group moved in the 1930s;
A black congregation who worshiped nearby named the building after themselves.
A black group led by Reverend John Howard Johnson captured St. Martin, and they led a boycott against pro-democracy protesters on Harlem's main business street, 125th Street, on resistance to recruiting and developing blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson's churchyards planned to rebuild it, they hired Carolyn.
Father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin, Rev. David Johnson, called Carolyn "the bells of poor people" with a twist.
An expert who played Carolyn in July told her something else: "A cultural treasure" and "An irreplaceable historical tool."
Tiffany, an expert at the University of Michigan, mentioned that this was the first Carolyn to be played by a black musician, Devoncio A. Lind, who moved to a large Carolyn in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mary Weider said that St. Martin did not change it.
What has been going on in St. Martin for the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been brought in by the church's general leaders and other ecclesiastical clergy.
The parish's governing body, which consists of general leaders, expressed concerns in July about the pastor's relationship with the architects and contractors sent by the relative, but said the costs would be borne by the parish, although the parish was not involved in recruiting them.
Some residents complained about the lack of transparency.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy for drowning in California
Government officials said shark fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on the first day of the lobster season on Saturday while he was diving to catch jinga fish in California.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Insanitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy running for help.
Hamel said that at first he thought he was running happily on the jinga fish, but then he realized he was running that I had been bitten by something.
Something cut me off.
Hamel said that when he went to the boy, he saw that his entire laughing bone had been opened.
Hemel said he told everyone to get out of the water and said there was a shark in the water.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The type of attack is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said during a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the boy had sustained injuries in the upper torso.
Officials have closed access to Swami Beach from Ponto Beach in Kasablad to Snetas for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
The UK's plan to enter the UK market
The department with the staff of the Sanzbri Specialshit Assistants is offering the products of Bots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with racks in the style of the store.
Britain's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion jewellery market, which is still growing while fashion and home furnishings sales are declining, is expected to see major rinks being built in 11 stores across the country as part of a significant influx, and if successful, more stores will be added next year.
Investments are being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelf spaces that were once used for TVs, microwaves and home furnishings.
Sensebrie said it would double the size of its jewelry offerings by adding brands such as Revolon, Ace, Tweezers, and Dr. Pa.
Current offers from L'Or<0xC3><0xA9>al, Maye Blaine and BritsBees will also be given more space by providing specific spaces for the brand, as is the case in bots' stores.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique make-up chain so that most products are vegetarian-friendly - something that young buyers are demanding more and more.
In addition, the fragrance retailer will also test the discounts at two Sanzbri stores, the first of which opened last week in the Croydon area of south London, and the second store later this year in the Sally Oak area of Birmingham.
A change in the trend towards online shopping and buying small amounts of daily food from local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sensabri's chief executive, Mike Cope, said his outlets would look more like department stores, while supermarkets in China were competing with discounted aldies and ladles with more services and non-food items.
Sensbury has also installed Argos' outlets in hundreds of its stores and introduced several hybrids since it bought the two chains two years ago.
Supermarket's previous attempt to restructure its manufacturing and pharmacy sectors had failed.
Sensbury had tried a joint venture with Bots in the 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes at a time when Sinsbury sold its 281 store of pharmacy business to Lloyd's Pharmacy China owner Celcius for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million thirty years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the project by offering skin care products from luxury brands in four stores, including La Roche Pose and Vichy, it said.
Paul Mills Hicks, commercial director of Sensible, said: "We've changed the shape and feel of our make-up jewelry racks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have specifically invested in specially trained staff who will be able to offer immediate advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need and the vibrant looking environment and spacious spaces mean that we have now become an exciting place to offer a make-up ornamental product that challenges the old style of shopping.
Peter Jones ‘disgusting’ after Holly Wolby’s 11 million pound deal exit
Dragons Dunn's Peter Jones TV presenter Holly Wolby is "disgusting" after her life-style with her brand business exited the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal. Wolby wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There's no time for a brand trolley of costumes and accessories to wear in their home with Wolubi.
The couple's business is compared to Gonith Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old Dez Morning's prez announced his exit from the deal on Instagram.
Holly Wolby left the profitable life style brand business of Dragon Dawn's star Peter Jones in the last minute, leaving her angry. Wolby wants to focus on his bumper contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones became "disgusting" when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlowe, Birminghamshire, on Tuesday that her new deals worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant she wouldn't have enough brand-new clothes and accessories to wear at Jones's home.
His business was compared to Gonith Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to have doubled Wolby's wealth to about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As the 37-year-old Volodya announced his departure from Trolley on Instagram, Jones immediately moved from the UK to one of his holiday homes on board.
A source said: "Trolley has been a top priority for Holly to a great extent.
This is their long-term vision for the next two decades.
Everyone was surprised by his decision to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday.
There is a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters that is ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of Dz Morning Prez, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cause the firm to lose millions of pounds due to heavy investment in clothing and home-made apparel products ranging from lanterns and candles.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Wolby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Don Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Wolby set up Trolley in 2016 with Cap, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple had a holiday together and owns 40 per cent stake in Jones Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will host the I'm A Celebrity show in place of Ant McPherson.
A source close to Jones said last night that we would not comment on his business affairs.
“And then we fell in love.”
He criticized the news media for making a comment that some consider "non-presidential" and ridiculed the North Korean leader for being positive.
Why did President Trump make such a big deal out of it?
Trump said in a mocking voice with his news anchor.
"I didn't get away from anything."
He recalled that Kim was interested in a second meeting with him, before Trump described the meeting in Singapore in June as an important step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Talks on the use of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "response" from the United States for its disarmament initiatives.
Instead, he said the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump seemed to be more optimistic in his speech.
He said, "We're going well with North Korea.
We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people have become victims.
Our relationships are strong.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and bringing the remains of U.S. troops home.
And they defended their unusual way of talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people in this crowded space, you see about 200 people standing in front of you," Trump said.
Tsunami in Indonesia, earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of lives were lost
As a result of the riots in Lombok, foreign foreign government organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a primary condition for international aid.
Ms Sombong said that in many cases, unfortunately, she was quite clear that she would not ask for international aid, which is a little too generous.
While Save the Children is forming a team to leave for Palo, it is not yet certain that its staff will be allowed to work on the spot.
Mr Sopoto, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palo Alto to determine whether international agencies should be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Despite the constant threat of earthquakes, the country is not ready to deal with natural disasters at all.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely seen on the beach.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palo is likely to be responsible for the loss of lives.
It is also one of the best places to visit in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
The ship is heading to the hospital in Lombok for the treatment of the earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of a natural disaster.
President Joko Widodo made his election campaign the focus of his campaign to improve Indonesia's ailing infrastructure, and he has spent money on roads and railways.
But Joko Widodo's administration faces a lack of funds, while the next election is due next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the growing religious tensions in Indonesia, while some members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed in clashes between Christians and Muslim groups, including those using knives, bows, arrows and other handguns, and several Hazaz people were displaced.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Strauss equalled Chelsea's score
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturgeon saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a score in the 89th.
Sturgeon received a pass about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal from Harden Shaqiri when his team was trailing by zero compared to one.
He took the ball first to the left and then shot towards the distant post.
The ball reached the top right corner of the floating net above the box.
The ball eventually fell to the net, slipping over the capa arzbalaga.
Sturgeon told LiverpoolFC.com that I was trying to get into this position, that players like reaching the ball and kicking as many as possible always play forward, so I tried to make the way for myself.
When I saw the fork coming, I touched the ball only once and shot without much thought.
Chelsea got a 0-1 lead in half time with a score in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker rotated the ball near the midfield and returned to Matteo Kuechke with a heel thump after racing in Liverpool's Half.
The coach immediately took over the ball in midfield.
He again brought the ball to the box with Hazard in a beautiful way.
Hazard hit the defense, throwing the ball from the left kick to Liverpool's Allison Baker from the top of the net from the next post.
In the group stage of the Champions League, Liverpool will face Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the stadium San Paulo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Vidotone in UEFA Europa on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster management agency said on Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
A spokesman for the agency, Sotopo Provo Nogograho, told a news conference that many people were trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which will cause waves up to 20 feet high in the sea on Friday.
The city of Palo, with a population of more than 380,000, is seeing debris of collapsed buildings everywhere.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman with a knife.
An investigation into the murder began this morning after a woman's body was found in the Burkina Faso area of Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street at Grayson Muse and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area to report to the police if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in the early stages, but I would like to appeal to those who were around John Street at Burkina Faso Head to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they have done some capture of dashcam footage because it may contain the same information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local of Burkina Faso and that the body was found inside a proprie.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman came to the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said they were in the process of informing the woman's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Muse has just tried to get into his flat but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was stunned when he found out about the incident.
Residents are now being told that it could take several hours before they are allowed back inside.
A police spokesman said the entire area was being cordoned off.
A woman came to the scene of the crash.
She repeatedly said, “That’s terrible.
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the fete while a car was parked outside.
A number of officials were inspecting the blocks of open flats inside the flats.
Anyone with information is being asked to DM <0x40>MeerPollCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 without giving a name by referring to the 247 log of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue outside Parliament to be the latest monument to be a victim of a dispute over 'restore history'
His exile will be a natural justice for the destruction of the Taliban's style of so many cultural and religious arts in England that have been at the hands of his fanatical and hardcore Isai followers.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crox's proposal "dangerous" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was nefarious that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be his target.
Cromwell did not order the demolition of England's civil wars, nor did he do so.
Perhaps in the previous century, the wrong Chromewall will be made a sacrificial goat for the actions of its ancestors Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorne's excellent representation of Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century, and part of a character's whims that many think should be appreciated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sandy Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be a person defending parliament against external pressure that was undoubtedly the kingdom for them.
Whether this is a valid representation has been the subject of ongoing historical debate.
One thing that is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict laid the foundation for the development of our country's cohesion and that Cromwell is the individual identifiable figure that represents a part of this division.
His works as Lord Protector are valuable and memorable.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man killed, identified only by his family name "Yuan", was found bleeding in a market in Liupashui area of Guizhou province.
A farmer in China's Xinjiang province is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005.
According to reports, he had come with his cousin to sell 15 cans in the market from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of the pig's cage open nearby.
He saw that there was a large male pig in the fence with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination has confirmed that a 550-pound pig crushed the farmer to death.
Guiyang Evening News quoted her cousin "U" as saying that her cousin's legs were bloodied and crushed.
A security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed him was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in a lock so as not to attack others while police were gathering evidence from the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating the compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, cases of swine attack on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and severely injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig killed a Welsh farmer with a tractor, but was driven away by his wife later.
When a pig oregano farmer was crushed in 2012, a mantoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the blood taste can act as a "trigger."
They're just getting drunk.
They're so cute, they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to appreciate them.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes over the ice-cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will cause flooding throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa's wind speed was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, a Category 1 hurricane, and its location 385 miles southwest of Penta Ogonia, Mexico.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a typhoon is starting to form over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the west coast of the United States, while Rosa is heading towards a Baja California plateau on Monday as a hurricane pushes the hurricane humidity northward towards southwest America.
Rainfall is expected to reach 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, Hurricane Irma will bring heavy rains to the south-west areas in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, landslides, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep Hurricane Humidity will bring the rainfall rate down to 2 to 3 inches per hour at some places, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arsana.
There is a possibility of 2 to 4 inches of rain in some parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arsana.
Flooding is likely to occur due to rapidly changing conditions due to the nature of rainfall and dispersion.
Due to the risk of rain, it would be extremely unwise to advise to go out on foot in the desert.
Heavy rain can turn watercourses into angry rivers, and storms with thunderstorms will lead to strong winds and cloudy skies.
The storm is expected to bring heavy rain to parts of southern California.
Overall, more than half an inch of rain is possible, which can produce fruit from soil erosion on roads and roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some scattered rain showers will begin to move towards Arsana on the sixth Sunday evening and early morning of Suwannee and more rain will fall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to continue into Tuesday and will continue into Wednesday.
In October, extreme temperature fluctuations can be seen throughout the United States, while the North Pole cools, but the region remains quite warm.
This often leads to dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
The dramatic temperature difference in Central America on Sunday is a great example of this.
There will be a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Amaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will again increase and expand.
The beginning of October is likely to be hot in most parts of Central and Eastern America and temperatures are likely to reach 80 degrees in some parts of the north-east from southern plains.
Temperatures in New York City are expected to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecasts are showing a higher chance of above average temperatures in the eastern United States by the first fifteen days of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brittany.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Keneva and woman who have accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford's testimony on Tuesday saw more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political tensions are still ongoing, and the last-minute unexpected situation that occurred on Friday, under which Arsana's Senator Jeff Flake created a deal to investigate the allegations by the FBI for a week, caused broadcasters to disrupt their regular programs.
Ms. Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that during a high school party, Keneva grabbed her and tried to take off her clothes.
During the emotional testimony, Keneva said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, according to Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The data was not available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, who showed it.
And Nelson has a problem measuring the people he sees in offices in general.
From this point of view, the size of his audience was the size of a playoff football match or an academy award.
Nelson told Fox News Channel, whose participants have strongly supported the appointment of Kenya with an average audience of 5.69 million, was ahead of all networks during the entire day's hearing.
ABC finished second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC's 2.94, MSNBC's 2.89, and CNN's 2.52 million viewers.
The hearing continued to be interesting.
Flick was the main character in the play on Friday.
After a statement from the moderate Republican office to vote in favor of Keneva was released, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him on Friday morning in a condition that protesters were running over him as they tried to climb into an elevator for a court committee hearing.
On CNN, it was shown that they stood for several minutes looking down when they were being harshly criticized.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the people?
He said, “You have the power, while many women have the power.”
Flick said his office had issued a statement and added that he had more to say at the committee's hearing before the elevator was shut down.
Cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting the event live, when the judicial committee was to vote to send the nomination of Keneva to the full Senate for voting.
However, Flick said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against Kenya next week, which has also been pushed by minority Democrats.
Fleck was convinced after a conversation with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Connors.
After talks with Connors and several other senators later, Flick made his decision.
Fleck's election was significant, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Mr. Kennedy without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kenya.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘politicizing’ Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "policing" Britain's future and harming the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reiterated his criticism of his Chequers plan for Brexit and said the UK and the EU's proposal to raise each other's tariffs was "absolutely far-fetched."
VIDEO: Police arrest Dayton Simpson for the murder of an LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing a 20-year-old basketball player, Wade Sims, in LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dayton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to jail for second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of a scuffle between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims' jabs were lost during the fighting.
Police were called to the scene and said they had found Sampson's DNA on him.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to fatally shooting at Wade.
The lawyer has reported that his bail has been set at $350,000.
East Baton Rouge Parish's Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck from the head.
The department appreciated the cooperation of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for assisting in the investigation for the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alifa thanked the area's enforcement law enforcement agencies for showing "extreme passion in delivering justice."
Sam was 20 years old.
The six-foot six-fored baton fell into the rut, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "deeply saddened" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
"That's what you've been worried about all the time," Wade said.
Fireworks in Mexico City.
The lava from the Popocatepeti volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Natural Disasters warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from wildfires when it began to spread rapidly and recorded 183 gas and soil emissions in 24 hours.
The center is monitoring a number of shocks and forward sounds.
Images on social media show a layer of mud on the glass of cars in Mexico City's areas such as Z<0xC3><0xBC>richmelko.
Geologists have observed an increase in volcanic activity following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, 45 miles (72 km) from the capital.
"Don Guo" Firefly has been active since 1994.
Clashes with police ahead of Independence Day.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona after clashes broke out between pro-independence protesters and police on Saturday, and thousands from both sides took part in protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of separatists, who were wearing masks, threw eggs and powder paint on the police, covering the streets with dust, where there is usually a rush of tourists.
Clashes also broke out between the protesters and police were called in to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-freedom groups chanted "no forgetting, no apology" while unionist protesters chanted "spin alive".
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries.
The October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, and the separatist Catalans celebrated it a year later, continues to be fraught with tension in the region with a sense of freedom.
Voters voted for independence with a dominant majority, if the turnout remained low, and opponents of the separation boycotted most of the voting.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop polling at polling stations in the region during violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups woke up Friday night to stop a demonstration in favour of the national police.
The protest was held but it was forced to take a different path.
Norris Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
We had some good times last year.
I saw my parents crying for joy when I took part in the poll, but now we are stuck.
Despite a major but low margin victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties are struggling to keep up the movement this year as many of their prominent leaders or leaders are either in exile at will or detained for managing the referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, who was recording a protest in support of police over the phone, said politicians on both sides had fueled the conflict.
He said the tension was growing.
Oriol Genkiuras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since last year, announced on Saturday that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
He said standing as a candidate in the European elections was the best way to denigrate democratic values and condemn the Spanish government's excesses.
London: Three people arrested for driving a car into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for multiple car crashes at a home in London's Derry.
The incident took place at the Balangard Crescent at around 19:30 British Standard Time on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said the gate and the building were damaged.
An arrow was also thrown at the car at some point.
Won 0-1 against the Rangers of Livingston by the goal of Menga
The first goal came for Dolly Menga's Livingston.
The advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers with the win and caused Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's streak remained different, while Gary Holt's team remained equal in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is without a win at the opponents' ground in the Premiership this season and will face Harts next Sunday, eight points behind him.
Earlier, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has taken his victories in the Division to six games, and Head Coach Holt has not faced any defeats since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
There are fewer chances against the Lewandowskis.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, while his knick-knacks caused Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson did break through, but could barely carry his effort to the front of the goal, then Alan Latigro found himself more wide-eyed before facing the R-par header from this Craig Halkit's goal.
The host team was satisfied with allowing the Rangers to play with them, knowing that they could put the visitors in trouble in the set-piece.
This was a very important shot.
Rangers provided a free kick and Livingston started when Declan and Gallagher faced Maler Manga, who scored from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers' position was dominant, but they found that the defending of the host team is untenable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly is permanently competent.
The same pattern continued in the second half as well, ifja Alfredo Morelos received a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was missed by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgrew took a shot away from another set play at Livingston.
In Livingston's box, the cross came in consecutively and the clearing went on consecutively, while the panelist made only two claims - when Halket faced alternative Glenn Middleton and for a handball - which were rejected.
"Extraordinary" by Livingston - Analysis
Tony Macaroni Arena at BBC Scotland's Aless Dar Lamont
An exceptional performance and result for Livingston.
For one person, they were great, who continued to perform more than expected in this high-altitude journey.
Their playing style and team-mates have changed little since their return to their peak flight, but the real reward goes to Holt, who has strengthened the team since their arrival.
He has many heroes.
Captain Halket remained strong, who presented a well-managed defense while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Varal on the toes throughout the game.
However, he was not impressed with the Rangers.
As good as they have been under Gerard's leadership, they did not meet these standards.
They didn't have control over the ball and could only start once against the hosts - and that's a risk bell for the Rangers while they're in the middle of the score table.
Welcome to the City of Ursula
On Saturday (September 29) there were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at fixing ties between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's involvement in the EU.
Erdogan later left for Cologne to inaugurate a grand new mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks after Turkey.
Police cited security concerns to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but several supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Urdu protesters - most of them Kurdish - also gathered and condemned Erdogan's policies and the German government for welcoming him into the country.
The protests reflect the fact that some Germans admire Turkish Erdogan as a hero, while others see him as an al-Anon ruler.
Depotford Road accident: Biker killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 a.m. British time on the junction of Bestwood Street and Elway Street on a busy street in Depotford, south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped the car and paramedics provided medical help, but he died on the spot.
The incident comes a month after another cyclist was killed in a shooting on Children's Street, about a mile away.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted and people have been advised not to turn to the area.
Long Larten Prison: Six officers injured in rioting
Six prison officials have been injured in a men's high-security prison unrest, the Prisons Office said.
The unrest occurred at the HMP Long Larton in Worcestershire at about 09:30 British time on Sunday.
An expert "Tornado" has been called in to control the chaos in which eight prisoners are involved. They have been isolated in a wing.
The officers were treated for minor injuries on the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Laurten.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and their imprisonment will be increased.
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, are held in HMP Long Larten.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison was injured in a prisoner attack, who was treated in a hospital.
In October last year, police were called in to deal with a severe riot in which members of staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (area affected by drought may benefit)
It's rare for a hurricane to affect Arsana, but it's likely to happen as early as next week when the rest of Rosa's energy desert turns south-west and presents a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for western Arizona for Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over the Phoenix on Tuesday after arriving with rain on Monday.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said, "Since 1950, only ten cyclones have maintained hurricane or blizzard status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that lived within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast 2 to 4 inches of rain, while up to 6 inches of rain is likely at Aka Daka locations in the Mogolon area of Arsana.
Other parts of the desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while the Aka Daka place is likely to receive a total of 4 inches of rain.
Areas that are out of the danger of floodwaters, the rain brought by the fast will prove to be mercy because the region is prone to drought.
Although the risk of flooding is a serious concern, some rainfall is likely to be useful because the southwestern region is prone to drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, more than 40 percent of the region of Arsana suffers from extreme drought that falls in the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the road to Rosa will pass through Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, who was maintaining hurricane strength with winds of as much as 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Penta Agonia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold waters in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore losing its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to hit the hurricane force in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora and there is also a possibility of up to 10 inches.
Rosa will then make her way east over Mexico as a hurricane and reach the border of Arsana as a hurricane on Tuesday morning.
The National Hurricane Center said the threat from Rosa and her remains would be extremely heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US desert southwest.
Due to these rains, deadly floods in the deserts can cause landslides and landslides in the mountainous area.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four men arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
A young boy was found injured in the Accelerator Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 British time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested from the Redstock area overnight.
Officials have appealed to people to come forward if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump says he has “bearded” the Democratic Party’s “community, anger”
Trump told a rally in the Wheeling area of West Virginia that a vote for Judge Keneva meant a vote to reject the Democratic Party's reckless and shameful moves.
Trump accused Kenyatta of "troubling and angering" the Democratic Party in its nomination process.
Keneva testified in front of Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied the allegations of Blasey Ford, alleging that Keneva sexually harassed her decades ago when she was younger.
Ford also testified about his guilt during the hearing.
The president claimed on Saturday that “the Americans showed the quality and courage of Kenya on this day.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that a vote to confirm Judge Keneva would be a vote for a lawmaker with the most legislated personality of our times and an outstanding record of public service.
The president referred to the significance of the Republican turnout in the mid-term elections, citing an indicator of Kenya's nomination.
It's just five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not participating in it, but I'm actually participating in it.
That's why I go everywhere in favor of great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and disrupt."
A senior aide to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first major vote in the Senate about Keneva's nomination would take place before Friday.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami kill hundreds of people, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and several others injured in a powerful earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a festival in Palo on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the beach at sunset and swept people and things along their way.
The tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Sutopo Provo Nograho, a spokesman for Indonesia's natural disaster agency, told a briefing in Jakarta that people were still busy with their activities off the coast when the tsunami threatened yesterday.
The tsunami swept along with it cars, trees, houses and everything on land, he said, adding that tsunami waves passed through the sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and thus escaped.
Some 16,700 people have been moved to relief centers in Palo.
Aerial images released by the agency show buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and a mosque submerged in water.
Earthquakes were also felt in the coastal city during the week.
The tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Review and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said that perhaps the city's geography, which is located on a long and narrow bay, has increased the intensity of the tsunami.
Nogarho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said some bodies had been recovered from the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
He said casualties and damage could be higher in the 300-km (190-mile) coastal area north of Palo, which is near the epicentre of the quake.
Nogarho said the communication system was completely destroyed and there were no reports from Dongala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people lived there and added that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected area.
He said it was a big deal and it could get worse.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting on the tsunami in Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a non-professional footage shared on social media, a man standing on the top floor of a building is warning people in the street below about the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the beach and flooded buildings and cars with it.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, disrupting communication systems around Palo and making it difficult for authorities to intervene in relief activities.
The military has started sending aid to cargo ships from Jakarta and other cities, but the victims are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief activities only and will remain closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit relief centers in Palo Alto on Sunday.
Death toll in Indonesia's tsunami rises to more than 800
The situation is very bad.
While the World Vision staff has safely arrived in the city of Palo, where its employees live in the Tarpaulin-based shelter in the courtyard of their office, they have gone through the scenes of destruction along the way.
He said many houses were destroyed along the way.
The situation is very bad.
While aid groups have begun the difficult task of transferring supplies for relief work, some have complained that foreign aid workers with high experience are being prevented from traveling to Palo.
According to Indonesia's rules, funding, equipment and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a natural disaster is designated a national disaster zone.
That's not yet.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Olia Ariani, said it was still a disaster at the provincial level.
Once the government says it's a national disaster, we demand international aid, but this status has not yet been granted.
After Friday's earthquake and tsunami, when the second night fell in Palo, friends and relatives of the missing people were praying to Allah that their loved ones would be among the miraculous survivors of natural disasters.
A small child was pulled alive from the drain on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers pulled a woman alive after two days of being buried beneath the rubble, while her mother's body was lying next to her.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Gundon Sabendano trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the others trapped in the hotel was Mr. Mandagi, who said his students were among them.
As a senior in the paragliding sector, I had my own feelings.
Mr Gundon explained how within hours of the news of the collapse of the Ra Ra Ra Hotel spread to the paragliding community, he sent WhatsApp messages to players from Palo who were part of the beach festival.
One of their messages received a brown mark instead of blue marks.
This means that the messages have not been delivered.
Thieves stole $26,750 during an ATM refill in Newport,...
According to a statement from the Newport Department of Police, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Bronx worker during an ATM refuelling in Newport on Friday morning.
Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release that the car's driver was preparing to put more money by emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex.
While he was busy with his work, a man "runs from behind the Bronx employee" and steals the bag he was holding for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene, but police did not give the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to "Ye"
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "I'm officially known as Kanye West."
The eighteen-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time now, and he has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande in the show, who cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons", the show's owner said.
With his current professional name being abbreviated, West previously said the new word had religious significance for him.
I think ‘yes’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you.” West said this while discussing his album with radio host Big Boy.
It's me, it's you, it's us.
It originated from the beginning, which means only one and now it has become Ye - which is a reflection of our goodness, our greatness, our anxiety, and everything else.
The album is also a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the few famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs is known by different names of Puff Daddy, P Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names of Lu and Brother Lu.
A former partner of West, JAY-Z, has also used names with and without hyphens and major characters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez vowed on Saturday to "never use force against the people of Mexico."
Soldiers killed at least 300 people on October 2, 1968, in a peaceful demonstration in Plaza, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to help young people by opening more free public universities and providing monthly subsidies to students.
He said that lack of employment and educational opportunities attracts young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI.
While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai Foley, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments are being made at a time when various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, although overall the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
China announced its plan last year and aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget will be a good start, while all other countries are far behind the United States and we look forward to the next big discovery at AI," Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that doubling the funding would double the likelihood that the next big success in AI is achieved in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New Global System" was published by Hotton Muffin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that killed America's highest-ranked Othello player. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised the previous U.S. government's technology challenges such as the Defense Advanced Research Project, the agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to identify the next generation of visionaries.
Lee said researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said it's not China, it's the corporates who are taking the teaching leaders.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
He said that those with PhD in AI should be offered a green card automatically.
China's State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said China's National Natural Science Foundation funds educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies pay U.S. researchers, but the quality of educational work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center aimed at engaging partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this year, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently spends over $100 million a year on AI research.
For months, the U.S. government has failed to legislate on the creation of a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians took part in the referendum to change the country's name.
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to name the country "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name reflects its claim to the region and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed a deal based on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change will harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign had raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of the turnout would be met to make the referendum authentic.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zuran Raif, believe it is the cost of entry to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia to live with freedom under the EU umbrella, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Ollieira Georgloska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally required, many MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the referendum.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of corruption as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
Gosse Tanowski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje, said: "I have come to vote because of my children and my place in Europe.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zuran Zayev, his wife Zurica and son Dashko are voting in a referendum on the renaming of the country in the Macedonian city of Stromica on September 30, 2018, paving the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Spokane, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavdarkov was preparing a small stage for those boycotting the referendum and drawing chairs in front of tents.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to raise our heads and join them, not through the service door.
We are not a poor country, we are a poor country.
If they don't want us to join as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration.
The Prime Minister said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment into Macedonia, with the country's unemployment rate exceeding 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour of it because 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said "yes" to the future.
A poll released on Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - much lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Tulma TV said 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be more than 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum will be a blow to the pro-Western government's policy that took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in Manchester City's 0-2 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguirre showed his score in the 65th minute looking ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the move.
Before reaching the open field, he left behind Brighton's three defenders.
Aguirre once again found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He dodged a defender and left several others behind at the tip of the Brighton box.
Then he turned to the left.
The English forward gave the ball back to Aguero with the first kick in the box, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and throw the ball to the right side of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguirre had some problems with his feet.
We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
And so it happened.
We were lucky to get a shot.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues an early lead over the Premier League.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguiro found the ball in the Brighton area.
He threw the ball to the left in a beautiful way.
San gave the ball sterling at the next post with a few strokes.
Sky Blues' forward took a light hit and threw the ball into the net.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 a.m., City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group Playoff in Rahin-Nicker-Irena, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Play Spoiler Than the Rockies
After the Nationals were out of the playoffs, there was no major reason for another start.
But Scherzer, who is always under competition, wants to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday but only if there are play-off implications for the Rockies, which dominate a game over the Los Angeles Daggers in the National League West.
Rockies received at least one wild card with a 2-5 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we will be able to compete knowing that here in Denver with spectators and the other team will be playing at the highest level.
Why don't I fight it?
The Nationals are yet to announce their starter for Sunday, but are reported to have given Scherzer a chance to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will take his 34th start, threw the bullpen session on Friday and is expected to play as usual on Sunday.
Wright Hender from Washington is at 7-18 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president cited the situation with reference to his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Keneva.
What we're doing is going to happen in November.
One of the most important elections of our time is five weeks away.
"It's a big thing -- I'm not standing in it but actually participating and that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You're looking at this horrible, horrible extremist group of Democrats, you're seeing it happen.
And they're determined to take back power from any source, you're seeing their shortcomings, their wickedness.
They don't care who's hurting, and who's crying out for power and control, they just need power and control, and we won't give them these two things.
He said Democrats are on a mission to “repair and disrupt.”
He called the Democrats "disgusting and dumb and mischievous and false" and said, "And you've seen this in the last four days."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking as Democratic Senator Dan Feinstein, which caused some voices from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Did you get the document?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He was the most beautiful man I've ever seen.
The church is no longer a large church.
He does not tolerate those who speak out of their hearts.
It's no surprise that some members of my family voted for me.
Finally, I'm the latest addition to the ranks of Labour MPs who have been told we're not a favorite - only because we speak from the heart.
My parliamentary colleague, young Ryan, also faced a similar attitude as she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the rebuttal motion drew me to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on similar issues that Jeremy does not agree with former leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour on Friday said, "We want to make the meetings inclusive and frequent."
Most of my eight years as a local Labour MP had Friday night GC meetings exactly the same.
Unfortunately, this has not been the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "the politics of kindness and kindness" has long been forgotten, of course, even if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the opposition opinion in the Labour Party is not being tolerated and every opinion is seen with regard to whether it is acceptable for the party leadership.
This has happened soon after Jeremy became the leader, because with me who previously thought he had a political perspective like mine, he started to expect me to take a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - no matter what I say - social media starts to rain down criticism and demands for rejection and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments about me are political in nature.
I am surprised to see the professionalism and commitment of these colleagues who suffer abuse on the basis of sexual and racial bias every day but do not give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era's politics is how levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote the tradition of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that wide-eyed church, and with the change of the rules of each no-confidence motion or election, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so clear, then I will be "okay."
I don't want to do that in politics.
Since 32 years ago as a school pupil I have been involved in the Labour Party due to the neglect of the Thatcher government which had brought my Comprehensionio school class closer to the end, I have tried to do better public service for those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever been confused about my policy stances and my disagreement with the current leadership.
The only thing I would say about the people who moved on Friday is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public service, I don't want to waste time and energy proving my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message that I would like to give to the voters of my constituency, not just Nottingham, but whether I am a Labour member or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of rejection threats or political will prevent me from working in the way I think is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
IR 17 - 38 milliseconds: Unmolested IR reached the top
The two late attempts could have created some highs and lows in the final result, but there is no doubt that Iyer was entitled to win in the surprise and diversion match of this tennis premiership.
They are now at the top of the table and the only team out of ten not to be defeated.
In the end, due to their excellent defense and better ability to take a chance, they were successful and coach Peter Murchi had the absolute right to be happy.
So far we have been tested in our game and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy.
Muller's Robin Christie said: "Ir goes to credit, they took better chances than us.
In Grant Anderson's 14th minute effort, which was converted by Frazier Clamo into the score, Iyer took the lead but Scotland captain Rory Hughes got a yellow card when Millers got a chance to increase the number, and Jason Bigott made an effort.
Clemmo solidified the lead of Iyer with a penalty in exactly half-time. He then scored the only effort to convert the score to 5-17 in the break.
But Millers started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was replaced by Bigott,
The match was delayed long enough due to a serious injury to Rutherford Natt, and Ire went further when the game resumed when Stafford McDowell's attempt was changed by Clamo.
Then Ire's vice-captain Blair Macpherson was shown the yellow card and again Mulrose took advantage of the extra player's presence and Bruce Coloine tried which could not be changed.
The host team returned to the game, however, when Strawn Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for tying the clemo without a ball, McPherson put the ball into the net on an increased Ire attack.
Clemo scored as he did on restart. Prior to that, Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box-kick and made a fifth attempt to host Gregor Henry.

From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, there is the proverbial inscription: "Our right to the sea is ours."
"It's our duty to take it back."
The memory of missing a beach at Chile's hands in a bloody collision at the 19th all over Bolivia - as well as the desire to sail across the Pacific - is still fresh.
These aspirations are now at their highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of proceedings.
Roberto Calzadela, a Bolivian diplomat, said that Bolivia has a spirit of strength, unity, and tolerance, and expects a result with a positive outlook.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, with the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile is responsible for negotiating with it to give Bolivia an independent path to the sea after decades of intractable negotiations.
Bolivian President Evo Morales, who has a magnetic personality, has also been forced to make a tough decision on Monday.
He vowed in August that his country was close to returning to the Pacific.
But some analysts believe that it's unlikely that the court will make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and even if it does, it won't make a big difference.
The Netherlands-based U.N. court has no authority to hand over the territory to Chile, and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Pasz Zarte, a Chilean expert on international law, said the fact that the ICJ decision is being given only six months after the final verdict shows that the case was not “complicated”.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, the last four years may have hurt it.
Zarte said the issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by Bolivia's current administration.
He said that Morales' controversial rhetoric has also ended Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile can continue to talk at any time, but then it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Volt<0xC3><0xA9>s, who is Bolivia's representative to the Hague, has rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday is an extraordinary opportunity for Bolivia to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and end 139 years of unanimity for mutual benefit.
Callsdale denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political tool.
He added that Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific.
The court's decision is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.
North Korea: Nuclear weapons are not acceptable without U.S. trust
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly this week.
He called on the United States to fulfill the commitments made at the summit between the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy in Singapore, three months after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a crude idea that the US objection to the continuation of sanctions and the announcement of an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel down.
Washington is cautious about making the announcement without significant steps taken by Pyongyang regarding disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about reducing weapons it considers to be the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
High-heeled shoes at the Paris Fashion Show
If you want to increase the cooling of your hats or stop the sun completely, don't wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie have showcased large-sized headbands on the runway for their SS19 collection that donated the style set to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer there was a plethora of amazing types of hats on Instagram and these designers have sent their great works to the catwalk.
The most prominent was a high-seeded coloured hat decorated by Valentino with wide edges such as peas, which covered the models' heads.
Other large-sized accessories include gemstones, a magician's hat and a pineapple-shaped hat - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom also revealed the selection of amazing types of masks - which are being presented on the occasion of Ain Halloween.
Many of the colorful breezy masks had their lips sewn and they looked Hannibal Lecter instead of modern fashion.
One of them was like a scuba diving gear with Googles and a sunroof, while the other looked like a molten ice cream cone.
And if you keep up the fashion statement - you're in luck.
It is predicted that a large number of such bonuses are going to be the charm of the markets near you.
The large-sized hat has appeared after a hat made from thinners called "La Bomba", which had heads two feet wide, and were seen on each head from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The group label behind this highly inefficient type of hat that spread all over social media has brought another major innovation to Cat Walk - a beach bag made of straws that is almost as big as the model worn in a swimsuit.
The orange-coloured Rafia bag burning at the Jacobus La Rivera SS19 at the Paris Fashion Week was the most prominent, with the Raffa<0xC3><0xB1>a fringe on the edges and the handle of the white leather on top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the arrival of large-sized hats and beach bags in large markets for next summer - because the designer has left such a huge impact that it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.
John Edwards: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintained a track record of academic distinction and continued to have excellent test results in 2018, reinforcing individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Endeavour Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best levels of service to students and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for the next and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As a field of education that can develop and apply a best-in-class curriculum, we are seeing modern languages as a popular and preferred subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he goes to his head."
If you talk to a person in his or her own language, it comes down to his heart.
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English in building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent test, we can see that the languages in independent schools are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rate.
A total of 68% of the students studying foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German readers, 69 percent of French readers and 63 percent of Spanish readers also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
As independent schools' curriculum and elsewhere in the selection of the article, languages now have the same status as STEM subjects (science, technology engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons for the difficulties in filling up vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more critical in preparing young people for their future careers.
As languages are becoming more and more necessary for job opportunities, these skills have become essential in today's world.
Regardless of career choices, if someone has learned another language, it will be a real benefit in the future because of having such a life-long skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries makes Hood a multi-skilled person ahead of the competition.
According to the YouGov poll, which surveyed more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of people were not able to speak a foreign language to speak well, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit rate, i.e. 15 percent.
This is why it is important for today's children to invest in language learning.
Skilling in many languages, especially in developing economies, increases the chances of getting a good job for children.
Within Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a choice of several languages available in independent schools and there will be a teaching staff with expertise in this field.
The Scottish Independent School is committed to providing an educational environment that equips and equips children with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today's global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are very important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and distinctions to Scotland's youth.
It's a failure to be fair.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Endeavour Schools.
LeBron will start playing for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
For those fans who want to see LeBron play for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in Sunday's pre-season opening match in San Diego.
He didn't say how many minutes he'd play.
Walton said on Lakers' website that it would take less than a minute to do so for less than 48 minutes.
Mike Troudl, a reporter for the Lakers, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Following the practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans regarding Lakers' six game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally on his YouTube channel
President Trump will begin a series of election rallies from the West Virginia area of Wheeling tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies scheduled for next week, including a short stop in friendly venues, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his election to fill the Supreme Court vacant seat pending a valid vote, Trump's incoming campaign is seeking public support for the midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally night and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7pm.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak at a hearing this week for his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct and postponed an expected Senate confirmation vote for a week until the FBI investigation is complete.
However, the main aim of this series of rallies is to help move Republicans to the polls in November.
So, according to Reuters, the Trump campaign's administration said the rally next week was aimed at "motivation among volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to save and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
A spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters: "Remaining control of Congress is as important to the president's agenda as it is to visit as many states as possible while we're on the cusp of a busy transitional season."
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling will "gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the coverage of the Pittsburgh media."
This will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, the state in which he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Maurice, who is behind in the polls.
Simon Hyder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said: "It's not a good sign for Morsi that he's going to have to come to the presidency to get ahead in the polls."
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA's determination to compete to keep the hopes to go to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Ryder Cup was the lifeblood of the pair on Saturday afternoon.
The amount of swinging pendulum movement is entirely an invented game concept, but an idea in which players believe with a heart, and it will never happen as much as it does in competitions like these.
Then they will say, "Where is he now?"
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I think we're taking that as a small amount of movement.
Of course, Europe has a lead, ahead by four points while they can try to get twelve more.
As Spieth said, Americans feel that their senses are still a bit recovered and they have enough to look forward to, especially in the case of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each gained four to three points.
Spieth has been deadly in terms of putting the ball into the hole and he has set an example.
While their round was underway, fans' screams were getting louder as they put the ball into the hole with a light-hitting multiplication and took four to four matches to their name - at a time when Thomas and they were behind by two points after two.
His golfing skills made him 15 when he played the match, as well as cheering fans' screams, in a way that tells you that he thinks the U.S. team is not out of the competition yet.
You just have to work hard for your game and be concerned about it.
The only thing is that each of these players is gone now.
There are 18 routes to the city.
The only players to have scored more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Flatwood, a Muslim story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's team is amazing but this adorable couple is perfect and doesn't expect any mistakes from them.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a single boogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also saved boogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and again on Friday mornings.
This race and the way their energy moves from and to the crowd of these stormy spectators reinforces the belief that they are the only players who will be picked up on Sunday, and compared to them there will be no popular players other than Flatwood or Molinari who can ensure the possible victory of the European team when the sun sets on the Gulf National.
The two of them are at different places together.
The beauty of Europe is in the past.
Boba Watson and Web Simpson finished the early work of the Morning Foreclosure's hero when her pair was with Alex Noreen.
In the first nine holes, a bogey and two doubles dropped the Spanish and Swedish pair into a hole from which they could never come close to exiting.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of the hole.
The interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the manner in which a strategy changes in a moment makes it great to watch the morning foreplay and the afternoon foreplay.
So far, the European team has shown a good game as a team and maintained its lead until the last day, but the Force's session has shown that the team has the courage to compete in the USA as well, which is suspected by some people, especially the state side.
Europe lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will appear with a clear lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after gaining a 10-6 lead in four-balls and four-season matches on Saturday over the United States.
The passionate pair of Tommy Flatwood and Francesco Molinari started the conflict with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods and has taken their telescoping to four points so far at Le Golf National.
Thomas Byrne's European team, which is trying to maintain its trophy lost in the Hazleton two years ago, dominated the U.S. team in the morning-forbes competition and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the Forces competition and won two matches, but did not meet the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy.
Flatwood is the first rookie of the European team to score four points in a row while pairing up with Molinari, who hails from "Mollywood," the first pair in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend and a four-point win in their opening four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reid in the Four Balls, they beat the best-ever combined combination of defeated Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a much stronger 5&4 lead.
Woods, who was able to win two matches on Saturday, made a surprise surprise surprise appearance, but has lost 19 of his 29 games in the Four Balls and Four Sams, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Day, who rested in the morning's Four Balls competition, returned to accompany Henrik Sutton in the Four Sams and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - whose world rankings are first and third - by 2&1.
The European team couldn't make it to a pleasant and windy day in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-time major championship winners Jordan Spaith and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won by a 2&1 over Spain's John Rahm and Ayn Poulter in the Four Balls, and later defeated Polter and McLaray by 4&3.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team been able to return to the game after a four-point loss by going into singles, though Furyk's team only needed to level the match to maintain the trophy.
After staying at number two for two days, however, it seems that the counter-attack on Sunday will be out of their reach.
North Korea says "no questions arise" without confidence-building, unilaterally disarmed
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was hurting his country's confidence in the United States and that there was no question of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, ending the site of the nuclear test, and pledging to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said: "We don't see any reaction from the United States.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under no circumstances will we be unilaterally disarmed first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to the "stage-by-step" strategy of denuclearization, his statement appears remarkable in that he did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued after the first summit between the current US president and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to make efforts to "clear the Korean region of nuclear weapons," while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 53-1950, but the United States has said Pyongyang will have to destroy its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "first disarmament" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner and is even objecting to the "declaration of an end to war," Rei said.
The idea that restrictions can force us to kneel is a crude notion of those who don't know about us.
The problem, however, is that the restrictions continue to increase distrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president had previously highlighted at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister specifically mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If South Korea were a party to this denuclearization issue, and not the United States, there would be no such a denuclearization halt in the Korean region."
Despite this, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it had become disrespectful to target U.S. soil with North Korean rockets after Trump designated Kim as a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for taking steps toward denuclearization at the United Nations this year, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a time frame for it, no matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia have argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must be implemented with intensity and without interruption until we achieve the goal of a complete, final and verifiable reduction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but only a few hours later North Korea had condemned him for "demanding like wolves."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile-making facility and also a nuclear complex provided the United States takes "responsible measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "responsible measures" he wanted included security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course to get plenty of sleep
Harvard University has encouraged all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep this year under a new course to counter the growing masculinity tradition through "all-night awakening" with the help of caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world's number one university are often unaware when it comes to the most basic things such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Sissler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Bad Gham & Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
After making a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on the reading process, they were motivated to start this course.
He said: “A girl came to me at the end of this (the appointment) and said: ‘Why am I being told this while I am in my senior year?’
She stated that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - a fact that surprised me.
This course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits help in academic and sports performance as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Brera, professor of mental illness at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce a course after finding out that students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tutorials.
In one section, students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive images encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
However, we understand that they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know about its effects on health when choosing to smoke.
He said the tradition of feeling proud of "getting up all night" still exists and added that the latest technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
He said that ensuring that you get enough sleep should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety – even to avoid obesity, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond Su, a 19-year-old California student who is studying chemical and physical biology, has helped Professor Paul Sissler develop the course, which he took in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He stated that the course opened his eyes and created a desire to try to start the course across the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be for all postgraduate students to complete a similar type of educational program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Seysler recommends that students should consider placing an alarm when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emanating from electronic screens and LED lighting.
Won by a zero on Livingston's Rangers: Menga beat Gerard's players with a goal
The Rangers suffered another setback when a Dolly Mnangagwa hit Steven Gerrard's unbeaten team with a goal against zero in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking to record their first win after a 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team imposed his second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as manager and kept his team just eight points away from the acquisition of Ledbrooks Premiership leaders Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the enthusiastic Rangers team could never beat him.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston has jumped to third place and is just behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
There may be more trouble for Gerard when he was hit in the head by seemingly throwing something from the other end on the Linzmann Colum Spence.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, reaching the semi-finals of the Irbetford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livi 11 that gave a point from Harts last week and he would have been happy with the way his turn at every turn brought down his opponents.
The Rangers might have dominated, but Livingston kept the ball under his control.
They could only score within two minutes of the start of the game when Menga's first dismissal by Scott Putman gave the ball into Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder saved on time.
By the time of Keegan Jacobs, the free-kick captain had reached Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Allan Lithgo threw the ball only to the back post.
The Rangers certainly managed to get control of the game, but in the last third, they could only hope for the game instead of being sure about it.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he would get the penalty on the quarter-hour mark when a collision occurred between him and Steven Lallis, but referee Steven Thomson rejected Colombia's appeals.
The Rangers could only shoot two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face any major problems with Lasana Colibaly's header and Ovi Azaria's weak shot.
While Levy's opener in the 34th minute could have been against the game's run, no one can deny that this was their first need.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' tactics.
Scott Arfield did not get a timely response when Declan Gallagher threw the ball towards Scott Robinson and he chose the manga to end his trick with a cool mood.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change showed an almost immediate effect when Wenger gave the ball to Moriellos but the impressive Kelly raced off his line in time to stop him.
But Livingston continued to force the guests to play the game of their own accord when Lithgow and Halket followed suit by other long-range shots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stage when Lithgrew threw from the corner to Header Jacobs, but McGregor came in the way and thwarted their attempt.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton made a punitive claim when he was confused with Jacobs, but Thompson ignored it.
Title: The Count of Monte Cristo
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, counting down to 30 September 1882, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a way to detect and measure radiation, which was an invention that eventually led to a device called the Geiger Counter.
It has been the biggest supporter of not only science but also pop culture since then, as seen in the 1950 movie "Bills of Coronado" in which seemingly unlikely Gaulle scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are actors:
Person: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Giger counter, which is used to detect radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radiation-induced atoms in the metal."
Evans: "Yes, it's really popping up!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention attributed to his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine system can train immune cells to ‘see’
New cancer vaccine system can train immune cells to ‘see’ and kill them
This vaccine helps the immune system to identify varicose cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves removing the immune cells from a patient and turning them into a lab.
Then they can ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers and then these cells are re-introduced into the body.
This test is showing promising results in a variety of cancers.
A woman who was treated with this vaccine had cancer in her uterus for more than 18 months, which trains the immune system to identify abandoned cells.
The procedure involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, converting them into a lab so that they can "see" the common found protein in many cancers called HER2, and then re-entering these cells into the body.
J. Burzovsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we now have a very promising vaccine.
Professor Berzovsky noted that HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancers" including breast, ovarian, lung and gastrointestinal cancers.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "promoting" them to target cancer cells has also been successful in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West, after his SNL performance, hails Trump wearing a MAGA hat
This is not a good thing to do!
In his ostentatious performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would fight for re-election in 2020, fans expressed disapproval against Kanye West during a Saturday Night Live show in the studio.
After presenting his third song that night, Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a hat that made America great, he rose against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person and they say, 'How can we like Trump, he's racist?'
"Yes, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved to the United States a long time ago," she said.
SNL started the show with a skit with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony against himself in front of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee for alleged sexual harassment by Christian Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's Herzha Sarai was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether or not Rock wants to ridicule the West through this posting.
In addition, West complained to fans that he had a difficult time behind the stage because of his hat.
"They threatened me behind the stage.
“Don’t go on stage with that hat.”
They threatened me!
According to the Washington Examiner, he then told me that he was in a kneeling position."
West added: "Do you want to see the kneeling place?" She added that she would "keep wearing her Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test the love."
Variety magazine reported that due to her comments, fans expressed their disapproval at least twice and SNL actors were looking upset.
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West, wearing a parier bottle, confused many with his song "I love it".
West was supported by Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "Salutations to one of the most inspiring souls: Thank you for resisting the mob."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just expressing her personality and it was absolutely amazing.
"However, I have chosen not to reward a person (by buying his music, or clothing, or by supporting his "fans") who I think has been pursuing an ideology of its own and beyond that which is harmful to my community.
He is FREE.
We are also free," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, and Puff Daddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg's name was Snoop Dogg, and of course the former legendary Prince of Music had changed his name to a symbol.
Man charged with attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed to death at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police said the incident took place in Hekamur.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star kit harrington's harsh criticism of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, strongly criticized the male-dominated hero's gut-wrenching tradition and said that showing such roles on-screen means that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Cutt said he understood ‘something went wrong’ and questioned how to counter the issue of toxic malevolence in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he was serious about tackling the issue.
"I'm personally quite serious at the moment about where we've gone wrong in promoting masculinity.
What have we been teaching men as they were growing up, about the problem we are seeing now?
Kitt understands that in the promotion of masculine masculine sexuality, television can be partially responsible for its very masculine roles.
They said, ‘What is the creation, and what has been taught?’
What is taught on TV, and in the street, makes boys feel they have to take a certain attitude to be a man.
I think this is a big question of our time - how do we change this trend?
"There is something wrong with the training of young men."
He also admitted in the interview that when the Game of Thrones series comes to an end next summer, he will not do any more series like this, because he is "enthusiastic with the battlefield and the horses."
From November, Cutt is a film producer and his brother who will appear in the remake of Sam Shepard's film True West, based on the story of a pirate.
The actor recently expressed the fact that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is one of the best gifts he can get from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so she gave me a family of my future and a new life beyond that.
Rose played the role of Kat's character Jon Snow's beloved Agart in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
She tied the knot at Leslie's family ranch in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials have said that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by it.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were affected by sexual intercourse, which is against the past tradition.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through the transfer of infected blood in parts of China.
However, at a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese medical officials said that the number of people infected with HIV in this way has reduced to almost zero.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China has reached 100,000 over the course of several years.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Most cases of transmission of these diseases are due to improper sexual protections in such relationships.
To address this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies her staffer leaked GOP senators data, strongly condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff published personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insisted that such claims were being made by "extremely right-wing pundits" and websites.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: "It's all lies, lies, and more fabricated lies."
The information allegedly released included addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee of Utah and Oren Hatch's homes from South Carolina.
The information appeared online on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information has been leaked some time after senators objected to Kavanaugh.
Hill reported that conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Red State reported that IP addresses indicating the source of the posts were linked to the Waters' office and also released information about a member of Waters' staff.
Waters added that the baseless allegation was completely false and an open lie.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security are at risk as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and open lies.
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online, including former White House press secretary Erie Fletcher.
Fletcher wrote that the denial is reprehensible.
This shows that she does not enjoy being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They don't have to work in a vacuum.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They need to be calm and peaceful."
It seemed that Fletcher was comparing Waters' response to criticism from Democrats over Judge Kevano, who was accused by critics of making Kevano look too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He said: "It's great news.
In a statement, Waters said his office had issued an alert to law enforcement agencies and the authorities concerned about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are made public and held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - The Innocence Project by Ryan Atkinson
It has now become a tradition to look at the importance of Brexit in the new film of any British point of view, but this does not come true on this update of Johnny English's action comedy The Wicked Amazes franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and re-released in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to get a clear picture of how much of a difference this country is going to have?
In any case, the eye-opening and rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English had a license to freshen things up a second time - and that his cues were more than anything else a broader comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic regions.
He is undoubtedly a crazy secret agent who, despite his strangely crafted sayings, has a little bit of Klasseau's inside features, Mr. Ben's Sean, and the man who presented only one head of the subject of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The origin of his role is based on the passenger and international man of the mysterious Atkinson, who would sometimes appear in Barclay Card's TV commercials and leave the chaos behind him.
There are one or two good moments in this latest J.E. Outing.
I loved being on the road to the Middle East with a helicopter in the middle of the night and a helicopter in the middle of the night.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is on display, but in the comic he doesn't know and looks oddly crafty, especially the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now offering humor with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's for younger children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's subtle movements are not as subtle and modern as Atkinson's silent movie movements in Ben's personality.
Now the permanent territorial jurisdiction is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered into the highly secretive web network of spies and is revealing the identities of all British agents in the field. He has now become a headache for the agent on duty. The role is sadly too small for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for a prime minister who is the heart-wrenching weak figure of glory, who is already in complete political disgrace. Emma Thompson best plays the part of Theresa May, but not much lives in the script.
Their intelligence advisers inform that because every active spy is in danger, they will have to bring in a retired person.
And that means bringing up Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a hidden area, but offers off-the-record lessons about being a spy: Here in some places it becomes difficult to stop laughing because Johnny Spy's School of Rock runs an academy of sorts.
Johnny is brought to the White Hall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-term partner, Bow, whose role is played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, all Marine Commander, the role of a Jolly Hockey Sticks in which WikiPaperdin is a little bit useless.
So Queen Alia's secret service returns the action of doing things in a manner reminiscent of Batman and Robin, in which Olga Corelenko's hospice month encounters Jabin Ophelia Boltova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously cast off by the magic of a Wigya tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: Manchus Jason Volta, who plays Jack Leslie.
Johnny and Bo start their story with funny coloring reels; in the guise of waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxurious boat and create chaos; and Joni uses the English word "reality" when he comes to the interior of Volta's house.
All the breaks have been saved for this last series of course, but as exciting and stormy as this game is, from the whole movie it looks like you're watching children's TV.
It is a medium sized material.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I'm always forced to think, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his ability?
The Labour Party has denied that it is planning to work four days a week for UK residents, but is seeking a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan that would allow British people to work four days a week, but pay them five days a week.
According to reports, the company's bosses want their workers to take an extra day off and pass on the savings they have received through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers.
Under this, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend - but the home pay will be the same as before.
Sources said that the idea would be a "project" for the party's economic agenda and projects that want to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The four-day week shift has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day working week is a movement that is conducive to the party's overall industrial strategy, besides balancing the economy back to workers.
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such an idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day week ahead of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole does not endorse this idea.
A Labour party spokesman said: "Four days a week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration by the party.
Opposition chancellor John MacDonald used the Labour Conference last week to present his idea of bringing a socialist revolution to the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was committed to withdrawing power from "non-faced directors and dissidents" in utility firms.
The opposition chancellor also means that existing shareholders in water companies will not be able to get their full share back because the Labour government can "cuttle" because of the perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to add workers to the company's boards and set up a content-owned fund to hand over 10 percent of private sector firms to employees, allowing workers to earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court and raises the question of whether the Bureau's investigation will force any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes," journalist Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI would be able to find something that would persuade them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more baobab than he had with him from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course (it could be).
I went to the court and talked to the judge.
After the charges came to light, I called Kevin and said, "Did you do that?"
There were two of them, and two of them, and one of them.
However, I did not see any minor in Graham's intention.
He said that his opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is irrefutable and there should be a dynamite charge to change it.
I don't know what happened with Dr. Ford, but I do know that Brett strongly denied it.
No one can confirm the name.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any major changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This week, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival in which many famous singers perform their fantasies and as much influence as it has on its mission; the end of global poverty.
In its seventh year, several thousand people at the Global Citizen Festival will gather in the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the singing of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness about its true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, an extension of the 2012 Global Poverty Project, is an international advocacy group that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively working against poverty.
A free ticket to this fair (if you want to pay for a VIP ticket is a different matter) requires concert fans to complete some task or "action", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful move to raise awareness of the goal of poverty alleviation.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal, while there are only 12 years left?
Is the idea of offering people free concerts a real way of convincing people to make practical action demands, or is there another form of ‘collectiveism’, in which people think they are doing a great job by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded 19 million "acts" of its supporters in favor of the demands of various targets since 2011.
It says the actions have prompted world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and declarations generated from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds received have directly affected approximately 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers in the UK and she is committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen providing $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda.
Tracey Alman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018 that with the help of the British government, the matriarchs, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of poor nutrition a thing of the past.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 demands from the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced to fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in need of nutrition.
In response to a question on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It's a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, like civil rights and anti-racism movements, we are also successful, because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers at this year's event in New York include Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Jeanne Mona, hosted by Deborah Lee Farns and Hugh Jackman.
US could use its navy for ‘blockade’ to disrupt Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, as the Washington Examiner reported, that "if necessary," Washington uses its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East.
Zanke has accused Russia's involvement in Syria as an excuse to explore new energy markets, which Russia has been running the country at the invitation of the Syrian government.
"I think their presence in the Middle East is due to the energy boom they're doing in Eastern Europe, which is Europe's southern belly," he said.
They have the means and means to deal with it.
He said the United States has the capability through its navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, shut them down so that their energy does not reach the market.
Zineke was speaking at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategy to deal with Russia and Iran and effectively has a monopoly on them.
Referring to Russia as a "tricky horse" whose economy depends on fossil fuels, he said the economic options for Iran and Russia are more or less fuel dependent and changing.
The comments come at a time when the Trump administration is working on a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, a more affordable option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump has made Berlin an "espionage" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of non-authoritarian competition.
After meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said: "I think energy should not be used as a pressure-boosting tool and consumers should be able to track suppliers."
Germany has strongly criticized the U.S. position and reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kampf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I am deeply saddened when a third country interferes in our energy supply.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider" running in the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "seriously consider" participating in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he would consider participating in the election.
According to The Hill, she said it was time for women to turn to Washington and fix our broken government and that needed a woman in power.
He said he would seriously consider fighting for the election of the president after November 6.
Warren made a sharp attack on President Donald Trump during the Town Hall and said, "They're taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has been critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents were of the opinion that he should not participate in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said they should not participate in the election.
Thirty-two percent supported participation in the election.
The survey showed more support for participation from former governor Divll Patrick, with 38 percent supporting possible participation and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that are being discussed for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
He told a rally for Donald Trump in Telsa, Oklahoma, that "after coming from the circumstances my son is going through, I can feel the pain of other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the wounds with which our troops come back."
Paul described his arrest as an "uncontrollable elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war soldiers, "They come back a little bit differently, they come back a little harder, they come back thinking whether what they, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military do for the country, is valued or not."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Department of Police, Track Palin was arrested in the Alaskan area on Monday and charged with domestic violence, domestic violence reports, and possession of a weapon in a drunken state due to an assault on a woman.
18 States, D.C. Supports Challenging New Refugee Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to people fleeing bullying or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from eighteen states and the District filed a petition with the Court of Appeal (Amicus Curie) on Friday in support of a challenge to the policy by refugees in Washington.
The full name of the lawsuit was not disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions case that the U.S. Civil Rights Union filed against federal policy in August.
She said her partner and "sons of members of her violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the state that supports Greece called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala the countries that produce the highest number of applicants for U.S. asylum as these countries face major problems of rabies and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum is against a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Resine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
The petition for cooperation with the court said that federal law requires that all claims for asylum be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and that this policy is in violation of this principle.
In the petition, the lawyers further argued that the policy preventing immigrants from entering the U.S. is detrimental to the U.S. economy as such individuals can become workers and provide "necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give any more shelter to those fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11, saying asylum is only available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution or political opinion, based on race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion.
Giving shelter was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Efforts are underway to save the victims in Palo Alto, doubling the death toll.
The condition of the survivors was more critical.
Ressa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, said the situation was "extremely tense" as she comforted her boy with a fever at a relief center in the affected city of Palo.
Every minute, an ambulance is bringing the bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Locals have been seen going back to their destroyed homes, trying to pick up equipment that was submerged in water and whatever was left.
Hundreds of people were injured and some of the hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are full of injuries.
Some injured people, including Dui Harris, who had suffered a fracture in his back and shoulder, were resting outside Palo's army hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building due to earthquake tremors.
His eyes began to tear when he was struck by a powerful earthquake that shook his hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
He didn't have time to save himself.
Haris told the Associated Press that he had been trapped in the rubble of the walls, adding that he had come to the town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they will be safe.
US ambassador accuses China of ‘threatening’ through propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese state-run newspaper published a four-page advertisement about the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited China Daily's supplementation in the Iowa state's best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. election.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. election as a new step in Washington's growing campaign to increase pressure on China, U.S. officials have told Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, there is a fierce trade war going on between Beijing and Washington in which they have announced several rounds of tariffs on each other's exports.
Chinese and US experts say China's counter-tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters in states that supported Trump's Republican Party, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa and a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a column in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China is increasing the threat by running propaganda ads in our free press.
Branstad wrote that in spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of every liberal freedom of expression and free press tradition in the United States by advertising in the Des Moines Register.
On the streets in China, you will hear limited voices against the government and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's views on China's troubling economic policy, because the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most popular newspapers was reluctant to offer to share his article, but did not say who it was.
Analysts have warned that the Republicans are manipulating women voters ahead of mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh verdict.
As many Republicans defend Brett Lee, nominated to the Supreme Court over multiple allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warn that he will face a backlash in the upcoming midterm election, especially on behalf of women.
The sentiment in this regard is already high, and most Republicans have publicly expressed that they want an opinion on it.
Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School of Political Science, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday that you can't ignore these things.
Rehr said he was not convinced that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute demand for an FBI investigation would be enough to convince angry voters.
Karen Jane Pier, national spokesman and senior adviser for the progressive group MoveOn, said women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and in November.
Mace reported that while protesting in the Senate on Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" the demonstration came as Republicans controlling the court committee decided to continue Kwanno's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
An independent political analyst, Steve Rothenberg, told the news site that the Democratic sentiment and motivation would be unexpected.
People say it's already too high and it's true.
But these sentiments can be even higher, especially among swinging female voters and young voters in the suburbs, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court-designated judge, analysts had suggested it would be met with a strong reaction if Republicans decided to continue the verification vote.
Michael Steel, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week that it has become a "brain for the GOP."
Guy Sissol, director of Priority USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats, told the news channel that the issue is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kiwano is added to the bench, but also how Republicans dealt with the issue and how they treated him (Cristine).
However, after the testimonies of Ford and Kevano, it appears that the Americans are divided on who to believe, while the latter has little benefit.
A new poll by YouGov showed that 41 people believe Ford's testimony to be definitely or perhaps true, while 35 percent said they believed Kevano to be true.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Kiwano might or certainly lied during the testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reported that following Fleck's demand, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by at least one of the plaintiffs, besides Ford, and Deborah Ramirez.
Ford, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated that Kevano abused her at the age of 17 in a drunken state.
Ramirez alleged that a judge nominated to the Supreme Court revealed his shame to him during a party in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web founder plans to launch a new internet compared to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is planning to launch a new internet in comparison to Google, Amazon and Facebook.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid lets users know where their data is stored and what information people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is "global domination."
He said: "We have to do it now.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
This includes a list of contacts, a list of tasks to do, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available on one browser at a time.
What's unique about a personal online data store is that the user has the authority to choose what type of information he can access.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's vision is to gather resources, procedures and appropriate skills to make solids available to everyone.
A security platform currently purchased by the company Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, consists of a community of on-staff developers and volunteer coders hired to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are "talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that would disrupt all business models overnight."
"We're not asking for permission.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is "to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
Berners-Lee changed the internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added that he is very optimistic about this next round of the web.
Bernard van der Waals: ceremony in honor of the pastor who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The ceremony was held in his hometown to commemorate 100 years of the only Church of England pastor to win the Victoria Cross during World War I.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann received the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Belangalis and Lehcourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a raid and he never found out that he had won the British Army's highest honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons in Northamptonshire's Rushden area unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone appeared exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning work.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Van carried his battalion across the De Saint Quentin River in "extremely deep fog and in the most intense firing from field and machine guns."
He later moved quickly to the firing line and led the front of his line with "greatest bravery" before striking a field gun alone and dropping three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German raid on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's accomplishments were something he could never accomplish, but were a humble national service.
After the parade, he and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, mounted a flower cover under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he felt honored to take part in the parade and that "an actual hero's bravery is being demonstrated with support from a lot of people."
MMA fans woke up at night to see the Bellator 206, instead they got the Pepa Pig
Imagine you wake up all night to see a little something full of Belator 206 just because you're deprived of the main event.
San Jose's ticket included 13 matches, including six on the main card, which was being shown live on Channel 5 in the UK overnight.
At 6 a.m., as Gigard Mossey and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when the chorus turned into a Pippa pug.
Some people wake up early in the morning for this competition.
One of the fans on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of silly joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said it was the government's rule that such content was not suitable for 6 a.m. and had to be transferred to a children's program.
"Yes, the pig."
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator, said he was working on his schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think when we think about replays, I think we might be able to find a solution.
But there are six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to broadcast it according to their schedule on Sunday, Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change was made, a lot of text messages were being received and not all of them were friendly.
We're trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not a government problem.
I promise you this won't happen.
We'll concentrate on five competitions instead of six - as we do as usual. We tried to give the fans more fun and we couldn't do that.
This is a disappointing situation.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daily had a feeling of being ‘lowest’ because of his sexuality
Olympique divorcing Tom Daily says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority due to his sexuality - but that prompted him to become a successful person.
Tom, 24, said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking at Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program, presented by Lauren Lauren, he said he spoke about gay rights in order to "give hope" to others.
He said that being a father, he was careless about winning the Olympics.
Christie Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a wimp in Lauren's first program, the Daily reported that she grew up with the feeling that she was "less than everyone else" because that was something that wasn't socially acceptable for boys and girls.
"To date, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different has given me the strength and ability to succeed.
She told him she wanted to prove he was "something" so she didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about her sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and appealed to more countries at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to lift the ban on homosexuality.
He said that he is speaking openly because he feels lucky to have been able to lead a normal life without Uqbe and that he wants to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said it was surprising for a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, to be caught in love with whom he met in 2013.
The Daily married Oscar-winning Dustin, who is 20 years older than him, last year but the age difference never made the issue.
"At such a young age when you had to go through so many things - he went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer - it was difficult to find someone of his age who had seen such a high low," she said.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and the Daily reported that he changed the context of his life.
"If you had talked to me last year, I would have said everything about winning the gold medal.
Did you know that there's more to life than winning Olympic gold medals?
My Olympic gold medal is ruby.
His son is named after his real father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
The Daily said that he did not accept that Dad was going to die and the last thing he asked was whether he had got tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the next row.
He said, "I don't think you're going to be able to sit next to me.
He told me that I held his hand when he took his last breath and I stayed with him until he took his last breath and I finally admitted that he was not invincible.
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that for him I had dreamed all my life - diving in front of the home crowd at an Olympic Games.
He also created a movement for the selection of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated in his mind while preparing for the Olympics and still makes him stand out.

Out-of-form Mickelson was added to the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to restore his form to avoid setting an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing for the 12th time in the competition every six months, is a record-holder for the Four Balls and Four Sams on Saturday by captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being the focus of people's eyes, which he has often had for America, five-time major championship winner Mickelson divided his day into playing the role of a chair leader and working hard on his game to overcome his weaknesses.
She has never been able to throw a straight ball at the peak of her career, so the 48-year-old is not fit for the Lee Golf National's course, where the long-sleeved ground punishes for the wrong shots.
And even if the course isn't that difficult on its own, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has won all four of his matches this week with Rookie Tommy Flatwood.
If the Americans, who are at a four-point loss at the start of 12 singles matches, start excitedly, Mickelson's match could be really important.
Favrek expressed confidence in his player.
He said: "I'm going to be in a good mood today, and I'm going to be in a good mood tomorrow.
He has full confidence in himself.
He has been popular and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I had imagined more than that, but what was supposed to happen happened and maybe that's what we thought.
Like every other player, he wants to be on the field.
He will play Sunday to break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches.
This may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, but it has nothing to do with his individual record highs.
Mickelson has scored 18 times of success, 20 times of failure, and seven times of equal scores (halves), although F<0xC3><0xBC>hrer said his presence gave a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he is funny, witty, clever, likes to flirt with people, and is the soul of the team room.
I think the young players enjoyed it with him and this week was also a lot of fun.
There's a lot more to it than the game.
European captain Thomas Byron knows the big lead could soon be over
European captain Thomas Byrne knows from his experience that a fairly large lead in the Ryder Cup finals singles matches can easily turn into trouble.
The Danish player began his career at Valdarrama in 1997, with a team under the captaincy of Seo Ballstr<0xC3><0xB6>ms leading by five points over the Americans, but they won 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 with a very narrow margin when they reached the finish line.
Byron said, "You've been reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Voldemort, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we were defeated and we won in Voldemort, but with very little margin.
So history was told to me and everyone in the team that the matter is not yet over.
Today go to the field with full preparation.
Go there and do everything right.
The discussion doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to win this trophy and all our focus is on it.
I've always said that I focus on 12 players in my side, but we're well aware that on the other hand we're competing with the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Byron added; "I've never rushed into it.
Tomorrow we will have a new call.
Tomorrow there will be individual performances that will be prominent, and that's a different thing to do.
It's wonderful to be on the field with a partner when the conditions are favorable, but when you're there alone, then your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is the message that you have to fully prepare the players and take advantage of their full potential.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and show his full potential.
Byron's opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than the pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of the four pouts.
F<0xC3><0xBC>hrer himself remained at both ends of these unexpected major changes of the last day, after being part of the winning team in the Brock Line he suffered a defeat when the Europe team won the "Madina's Kramat".
When asked how he got his players to the finals in 1999, he replied, "I remember every word of it."
Tomorrow we'll have 12 main matches, but you'll want to get to this quick start as you saw in the Brookline, as you saw in the Medina.
When the amount of movement remains on one side, she puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We're going to have to get our hands on it, and we're going to have to play some kind of game tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with leading the counter-attack and will compete with Rory McLaray in the top match and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Flatwood and Ian Pollter and other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"I put my players in that order because I think it covers the whole game.
Germany's new war ship has been delayed once again.
The German Navy's new frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era ships, but it won't be until at least next year, according to local media, due to poor systems and high cost.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the first of the completely new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems have put the Olwalzm project at a disadvantage.
Four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is believed that these ships will have a powerful artillery, a variety of aircraft-smuggling and sea-smuggling missiles, as well as intelligence-seeking technologies such as radar, infrared, and sound equipment.
Other key features include longer durations of maintenance - modern frigates can be deployed away from their home port for up to two years.
However, Die Zeit pointed out that the continued delays in these state-of-the-art warships would make them already obsolete at the time of entering service, which is said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength across the sea.
The low-luck F125 frigate came to the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to Blohm & Wass Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a ship has been returned after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited "a number of serious flaws in software and hardware" that would disable the battleship if it were assigned to a tactical mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships were to be operated by a crew of only 120 Sailors - about half of the workforce on the old Bremen class ships.
It also came to light that the ship was heavily weighted which reduced its performance and limited the ability for the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland Falls is believed to weigh twice as much as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to poor hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, has also become an issue.
Its cost is said to have reached a whopping <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The importance of the problems facing the new frigates grows even more in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Battles, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the navy was lacking in deployable ships.
The official said that the problem has become serious over time, as the old ships have been discharged but new ships have not been delivered.
He lamented that no frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The Secret Life of the National Trust
A new study conducted in a Scottish highlands jagir aims to find out how bats use natural landscapes to find food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these mammals flying in a unique way and provide guidance for future conservation activities.
The research study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland at the Inverwe Gardens in Westeros, included common and supernovae pepsi trellises, as well as brown long-eared and daubinton bats.
Special recorders will be kept at important places throughout the area to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will perform in the mobile survey using manual detectors.
An expert voice analysis of all recordings will reveal the frequency of bat calls and what types of calls are doing.
A detailed picture of their behavior will then be mapped and reported.
Rob Daver, Natural Protection Advisor for NTS, expressed hope that the results will show which areas of the freebomb are most important for bats and how they are used for each type.
This information will help determine the administrative functions of the free-bomb, such as establishing green pastures for bats and related species, and the benefits of maintaining forests.
There has been a significant decline in bat populations across Scotland and the UK over the past century.
Their populations are threatened by construction and development work that affects their habitats and native booms.
In addition to wind turbines and lights, flypapers and some chemical components of building materials and attacks of pet cats are also a threat to them.
The shadows are not really dark.
However, due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch a catch.
She uses a stereoscopic echo-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles in her flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 37 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the ashtrays, and perform rescue operations.
The organization is Scotland's first and only bat safe house in the Treave State in Dumfries and Galway, with eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
State manager David Thompson said the state is a better place for them.
He said: "We've got a fantastic place for the kids here.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good-born boom.
But there are many things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we are doing here or elsewhere will help to understand what is needed for them to grow.
He stressed that it is important to detect bats before starting the maintenance work in buildings because it is possible that destroying a maternity shelter in Anja could kill up to 400 females and children, possibly a full-fledged local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, threaten or hurt them or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the Bet Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We know a lot about bats right now, and for many species, we don't even know what their habitats are.
Ronaldo's sexual assault allegations have been denied, while lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the sexual assault claims against him as "fake news" and said people want to be famous by using his name.
His lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
An American woman, Catherine May Urga, has claimed that she was raped by Portuguese influencer Ronaldo in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Ronaldo was accused of paying Catherine $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Hours after the claim was reported, speaking to its 142 million followers via Instagram Live Radio, the 33-year-old Ronald dismissed the reports as ‘fake news’.
He said, "No, no, no.
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera that what he is saying is “fake news”.
They want to know my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's what happens in such actions.
He smiled and said, "I'm a happy man and everything is going well."
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which he described as "unacceptable reporting of suspicious things in the field of life."
"Ronaldo will claim damages in accordance with the serious nature of the breach, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years," he said.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to the papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and May Yurga allegedly went back to the Players' Room, where he allegedly sexually assaulted her via anal.
May Yurga claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo sat down on his knees in front of him and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but that he had been overcome by "one percent evil".
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that he had sex, but it was consensual.
May Yurga also claimed that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries to the hospital, but later she agreed to settle outside the court because she was "feared of retaliation" and worried about "public humiliation."
34-year-old May Yurga says she wants to end the settlement because she is in constant trauma due to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United and join Real Madrid, and has moved to Italian club Juve this summer with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain will “always regret” the loss of cartels
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would be "always sorry" if it lost its status as a global leader in the automotive sector after Brexit.
He added that it was "extremely worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby, if the UK exited the EU without a deal.
Mr. Clark said that we need a deal.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of the border delay will be affected in case of a no-deal Brexit.
The Bernastone plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
Maroon Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernastone, said: "My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be productive breaks in our factory.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how to trade across borders.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Manufacturers say most of the concerns in the event of a no-deal Brexit are related to supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line runs on a 'fast delivery' basis, under which parts from suppliers from both the UK and EU arrive every 37 minutes for order-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays or cuts in the supply of parts.
The company says it will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory in its Derbyshire plant.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan for Theresa May's future relationship with the EU was "designed to avoid these inspections at the border."
He told BBC Radio 4's Two-Day program, "We want a great deal that will enable us to succeed under current circumstances, but take full advantage of this opportunity."
The testimony of not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we have to be able to fully continue our highly successful supply chain.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned that long-term cost increases would reduce plant competition and eventually affect jobs.
Peter Sassours, who has been working in Bornaston for 24 years and is a United Union convenor at the plant, stated that he is very upset with: "In my experience, when these jobs end, never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a correct and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be delayed by another week," while a dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is still ongoing.
Rosinstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump's aides and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will threaten Mueller's sovereignty by dismissing the deputy attorney general has been a topic of gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosinstein had discussed the possibility of using the device to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Russia has denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House despite reports of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not prefer to remove Rosenstein, but then postponed a meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which witnessed both Kiwana and another woman, Dr. Christine Ford, who had accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kiwana, which led to a further delay in the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, with other things going on in the Supreme Court, I see it will be a week more delayed.
But we'll keep an eye on it and I'd always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters will reject the claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
"Although the lack of briefings was not due to the displeasure of T-journalists, I will not deny the fact that they think so," Sanders said.
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more questions and answers than the previous president: we've seen their numbers," he said, without making any reference.
"The briefings will still be there, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's certainly much better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We do our best to do this and you've seen us do it in the last few weeks and this press briefing will take place when you speak to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly asks questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or a press conference with dignitaries.
Single-party conferences are very rare.
In New York this week, the president probably cited a violation of the rules and sometimes a different kind of attendance to reporters gathered.
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers on the fear of Brexit in NHS Scotland.
The Health Secretary has written a letter to the NHS staff in Scotland expressing his gratitude to the country and his desire to stay after Brexit.
Freeman's letter comes less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to meet the cost of settlement applications for EU citizens already working in advanced public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "There are ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU in the summer, which is expected to be decided this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepped up preparations to deal with any possible non-compromising situation.
This is a very difficult time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the role of each member, regardless of the nationality of the staff.
The EU and long-term partners bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and you want to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had to undergo an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee's Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie suffered a head injury during the match with the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday and then underwent emergency surgery after being defeated 27-31.
The head coach of the state of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to one side and fainted there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel rolled the abercrombie to one side and gave oxygen before taking it back to the stretcher for further inspection.
An official from the state of Tennessee told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's surgery had been performed at Wanderer Built Medical Center.
Harris added, "There are currently no details available regarding the nature/singularity of the injury," and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a junior, is playing his first season with the state of Tennessee since his transfer from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he took five tackles totaling 18 of his tackles in the season.
More stamp duty will be imposed on foreign buyers buying property in the UK.
More stamp duty will be imposed on foreign buyers buying property in the UK, with additional money to be used to help homeless people under new tory projects.
This move will inactivate the success of Carbines Drive to attract young voters.
Stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Department of Finance is expected to receive <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that it has been decided to impose more stamp duty on foreigners buying property in the UK - with additional money to be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt by Jeremy Corbyn to provide young voters with a more affordable home bar with an oath and to undermine the campaign's success in targeting more earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and entities that are not paying taxes in the UK, with the additional money being used to promote the government's campaign against gold.
The surcharge, which is an increase in the current stamp duty, including higher levels that were introduced two years ago on purchases to pay for other homes and rents, could be up to three percent.
The Department of Finance is expected to earn <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually from the move.
About 13 percent of new London properties are bought by non-British people, making it difficult for first-time home buyers to even step on the buying ladder.
Many of the country's most posh areas - especially in the capital - have become "boot towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just two weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty so that more young people could buy their first home.
She accused the big construction companies of overcharging property prices by buying and not using land, and expressed a desire to Mrs May to eliminate quotas on cheap homes to get rid of "domestic abuse" in the UK.
Mr. Carbyin has announced a series of attractive proposed reforms including rent controls and "Bana Kutahi"
They also want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the restoration of the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken home market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and live free.
However, it may not be as easy for those who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign companies to buy houses like hard-working British citizens.
For many people, owning a house has become just a dream, and gold has become a dull reality here."
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland owner Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Scott is going through the challenge of reviving the 42 Northeastern club, which is now three points short of the first position in League One.
They went to this summer's Stadium of Light after taking St. Mirren (St Mirren) to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country.
I was given the B cap and the bus," Russia told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But Scotland grew up watching him with his father on Hampden and that's what drew me back.
I will only be able to do that if I win the championship."
As manager of Sunderland, Russia's predecessors include Dick Advocat, David Moises, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poit and Paulo de Kanio.
The former boss of the Alloa Athletic says that after being rejected advance by Barnsley and Ipswich Town, they had no fear in following such names in such a big club.
“At this point, success will be measured to me by ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
"In terms of the structure and facilities of this club, obviously his place is in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to take him there, but I'll consider myself successful here if I can get the club back there."
Russia has only three years left in its management career after spending 15 months in Dumbarton as an assistant bass and Harts' coaching staff.
They then saved Alva from leaving and helped her recover to third place, and saved St. Mirren from leaving the following year, making her one of the championship title winners.
And Russia says he now feels more relaxed than his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Marin and Hamilton Academy.
Recalling Alva's handling of the charge, he said, "It was a square in real sense.
"I really felt that management was better for me than playing."
It seems strange because I played fine, made a lot of name and money from it and also enjoyed a somewhat high quality life.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you need to do on a weekly basis.
As far as stress and pressure at work is concerned, I am still facing them, but I think management is appropriate.
I've always wanted to be an organizer and now that I've done that, as much as my life has been in adulthood, I think it's more comfortable than my whole life.

A survey has found that the best time to drink a pint is 5:30.
The summer heat wave has increased sales of British low-fat pubs, but has also increased pressure on restaurants.
Statistics show that pubs and bar groups saw sales grow by 2.7 percent in July - but its sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business advisory firm that collects these figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and longer participation in the World Cup, contrary to England's expectation, meant a continuation of last month's June style in July when sales of pubs increased by 2.8%, except that restaurant sales fell more than expected.
Restaurants' business fell 1.8% in June, making it worse in July.
If compared to the sale of restaurants, as far as the sale of restaurants went down, the pubs and bars that run on alcohol have been successful so far.
Pubs that run on food were also affected in the sun, but not as much as restaurant operators were affected.
It seems that people just want to go out drinking.
Similarly, the sales of managed pubs and bar drinks increased by 6.6% this month, while the sale of food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, regional sales manager for luxury and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
As far as sales in the outdoor market are concerned, the weather and the impact of important social or sporting events are the biggest factor.
Despite a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales, it's no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling and this will be especially distressing due to the ongoing price pressure.
There was no worse time than the long hot summer coming up for food-driven operators, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures seen in August will provide the necessary time-consuming relief.
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new entrants, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in the trend towards brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector industry sales and collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry's recognized benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One survey found that one in five children - even those under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "central" account to show to parents.
One in five children - even young people under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a sharp increase in "fake Instagram" accounts - in reference to a photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has added to the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20% of students said they have a clean "main" account to show to parents, while also having private accounts.
A mother secretly looked at her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, revealing a young girl who was wishing others would "go along" with her.
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Head Mistresses Conference of Autonomous Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which admit to maintaining their private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Bacon said: "It's disturbing that so many young people are engaged in creating online accounts where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Elie Doyle will be the voice of "athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Elie Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member during the Scottish Athletics Annual General Meeting.
Dual holds the most spectacular track record in Scotland and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty sees the move as a great opportunity for sports leaders who want to benefit from his international experience over the past decade.
"Alley has a lot of respect for the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are very confident that his coming to the board for athletics in Scotland will be very useful," he said.
"I'm excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to help and play my part in leading the sport in Scotland," he said.
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres race with his other four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, and is now a regular BBC punt, was unable to walk after a temporary stroke attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I was attacked by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
It was a very patient effort but I've fully recovered and have learned how to walk again, and today I'm doing back-to-back exercises!
Thank you for the inspirational messages!"
An advertisement of the breast pump in which the mothers were compared to rabbits has divided the online opinion
The ad from a breast pump company split the online feedback, comparing nursing mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of the "world's first wearable brist pump," consumer technology company Elvie has surprisingly released a music video ad to show the freedom that new pumps give mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing to a song in a cage full of beeswax that says: "Yes, I suck my own milk, but you won't see any breath" and "If you don't mind, it's not my breasts."
The song continues: "Get him out, get him out, I'll feed him to the kids, get him out, get him out, I'll milk the women."
However, the ad that appeared on the Facebook page has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video has received a mixed response from viewers, often saying it is highlighting the "bad effects" of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad decision to use rabbits to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant to produce milk and have to have a baby, except that their babies are stolen from them only a few days after birth," a woman wrote.

Another commented: "Of course it is painful for the child and the mother.
"Why don't they use it as a weapon to protect their children?"
Someone else said, "It's a very bad sign."
Others defended the ad, in which a woman admitted that she found the song "fun".
"I think it's a sexual fantasy.
If I could still drink milk, I would buy it.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I've taken it exactly the way it was intended.
He said: "It's a creative process.
Another commented: "It's a comic ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and make them feel like their own "cow."
This ad is not about praising the dairy industry or forming an opinion about it.
At the end of the video, the women's group revealed that they were dancing by placing a pump in their brazier.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who pump breast pumps look like their own cows.
However, the Elvi pump is soundless, has no wires, and carefully fits inside the nursing brazier, which also enables women to move, hold their babies, and go out while pumping.
Anna Blaren, partner at Mother, commented: "The Elve pump is such a revolutionary product that it needed a fearless and active launch.
We wanted to highlight the beauty of pumping and all of its challenges by keeping the women and dairy buffaloes doing it in parallel, while by expressing it in a fun and relevant way, we wanted to evoke the wonderful sense of freedom that this new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Ellie has come into the pump reds.
The mother of two children at London Fashion Week wore this product and came on the catwalk for designer Marta Jacobowski.
Hundreds of refugee children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of children detained has increased, although the monthly cross-border rate has remained relatively the same, partly due to the policies and narratives introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear that their own ability to stay in the country by claiming a child will also be at risk.
The threat further escalated in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adult members of their family must submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanese, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor young children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a past criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of these people's collections are illegal residents in the country who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' family and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
So, we're going to investigate these individuals," Mr Albanese said.
According to asylum activists, authorities are introducing new laws that would require some of them to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days of detention, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be presented before an immigration judge via video conference call instead of presenting themselves to pursue a legal status case.
Those who are considered ineligible for release will be de-ported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be disturbed or saddened, according to reports from asylum activists and systems, which could be a precursor to violent protests or attempts to escalate.
Lawyers said the protections are even higher in major centers such as Toronto, where children are more likely to ignore signs of distress due to the large volume.
He added that moving to Tent City without giving children enough time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to friends can cause shock, which is already quite a lot of children suffering.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupiers" to leave immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maleem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
The teacher, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be dealt with accordingly."
He said: "They should be removed immediately.
The teacher insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria is "almost over" with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war" against both terrorist groups and "an illegal foreign presence" until we clear all of the Syrian territories from them, he said.
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arab and Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 ground troops are in the country devastated by the French war.
On the issue of Syrian refugees, the teacher said the conditions were appropriate for their return and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fear" that kept refugees away.
"We have sought help from the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be based purely on humanity."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria unless there is an agreement between Bashar al-Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the former main rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity for further pressure for political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has halted an attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
The teacher, however, stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including the Nusra Front, which includes al-Qaeda-linked fighters, which would be "finished."
U.S. envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to hold a meeting of the new committee soon, which includes government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
The teacher explained the Syrian government's conditions for inclusion in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be "restricted to the review of the existing constitution" and refrain from interference.
Trump will win a second term.
In this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 provided the impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency in advance, as many liberals hope.
"This will be the most dramatic finale of all time!"
So far, there are no signs of anxiety.
Since 2014, Prime Time ratings in CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and doubled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has taken the first place in cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers in mainstream newsnights.

Of course, apart from anything on television, the story coming from Washington's Roy Wade (Roe v. Wade), whether immigrant families can come together again and determine the future of the global economy's health.
Not paying attention is a luxury and only the most deserving viewers can afford it.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you use a six-hour panel of experts to "deep background" Bob Woodward's book "Fear," details Paul Manafort's $15,000 camel leather bomber jacket (see also the Washington Post's "Washington-Lessons About Mr. Trump").
I don't think I've ever seen Super Mario before.
Brent Montgomery, the chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the daily "Pawn Stars," gives the impression that the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily sketch of what they're doing is a part of it, as they say, "to buy a fight with N.F.L., to praise Kim Jong Un."

When I arrived at Mr. Flies this month, the weather was warm up to 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was watching MSNBC recording CNN sitting inside the house.
They could not keep themselves away, and not at all, when Brett Kavanaugh is to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court is swinging on that balance.
Mr. Flies told me, "I remember when we used to do those great shows all day long and people used to say, 'These are the beginnings of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was kind of funny, but it was clear he was telling the truth."

There's a lot of money going into the mid-term elections.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th election is witnessing a sliver of money, thanks to the re-introduction of congressional districts that has led to two new candidates for the same seat.
It recently won the Pittsburgh District's Pittsburgh Democrat Representative Connor Lamb - who won a special election in another district last spring.
Libby is competing with another Republican representative, Keith Rothfuss, who is still representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which is quite dominant as the new 17th district.
The maps were reworked following a January decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which said the old districts were unconstitutionally closed to benefit Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a financial battle between the party's financial aides, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been owned by a Republican for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador on China's support and then turned away from it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing after some pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and one of his hotels was in Panama, even as his partner expelled the management team of the Trump Organization.
Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department of State, said in a statement earlier this month that the State Department officials "decided to call the U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan any more."
But the sentences were reserved only against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sentences, which included a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions focused on the target, could have been painful for the Central American country and its growing unemployment and murder crimes rate.
As insider meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, and was seen as a key step in efforts to prevent refugees from entering the United States last year.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted progress at the conference, which would effectively end any penalty reservations for El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is being criticized for speaking at a conference in mid-October as a sign of a change in administrative positions at the gathering.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or punishments from the United States.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who were ready to discuss internal debate on condition of anonymity.
His accounts were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration and he also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next thing that could happen is a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, about which there is now enough clear evidence in the public record.
Miller is now turning to his investigation to see if Trump's campaign was a conspiracy to attack Russia's election.
If Congress changes its stamps, Mr. Trump will face accountability in the institution, and probably the jury of his peers, before he goes to the voters.
There are many, if not all, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's departure is final - at least not at all like his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make some choices that will decide how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, if only the West had opposed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak people in Munich, German officers were ready to launch an organized revolt against Hitler.
We failed and missed an opportunity to escape the coming years of the massacre.
The path of history depends on such changing points of view and the inevitable journey of democracy is fast or delayed depending on it.
The U.S. is facing a number of such challenges.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Ever since the newspaper reported that Mr. Rosenstein suggested the president's secret recordings and suggested they were inappropriate for the post, he has been in trouble.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is wrong.
"What if Brett Kavanaugh's investigation of the newly requested F.B.I. is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite solid evidence and false testimony of sexual assault?
And above all, what if we vote for Congress in the middle term that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will suffer from a long cold winter.
But because of my lessons learned in Prague, I am sure that we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and after 60 years sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table in Swastika.

The Rangers' Graham Dorns are hoping to compete with Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that despite the victory against Austria and the draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they will remain in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
The injury to the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorsey from presenting his first game of the season until Villarreal drew 2-2, however, he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard for future spectacular results.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team.
We went into the match with the belief that we could get something and we got a point.
We could have made it to the finals, but overall the scare was a fitting result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better and relatively good competitors in the second half.
There's another big European game on Thursday.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough match because they have had a good result in their last match but because the fans support will be with us, I hope we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard and whatever happened to my injuries and changes to the club, but now there's a good feeling about the place.
The squad is good and the players are really enjoying it; the training is also very good.
Hopefully, we can move forward, and succeed by putting the previous season behind us.
Women can't sleep on their own.
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how to take care of them, very few people were talking to their family members about it.
Nearly half of the respondents in the country-wide study said they had been discussing long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member who takes care of them, but they are not taking steps to discuss it," said Holly Sanders, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
We have to start from here.
Talk to your children and spouse: If you do not inform your family of your wishes ahead of time, you may not be prepared to provide care for your family.
Discuss how to receive care to work with your counselor and your family, as these options can be a significant factor in cost determination.
Bring your financial advisor up: Your advisor can also help you come up with ways to pay for these expenses.
Your funds for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to cover these expenses, or personal insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Take out your legal documents: Stop legal battles.
Get health care support so that you can entrust your medical care to a trusted person and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
In addition, take into account the authority to make your financial decisions.
If you are disabled, you will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your bills.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Authorities say at least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, with the death toll expected to rise.
Rescuers have not received any reports from the devastated Dong Gala area, an area north of Palo and close to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the storm hit.
The following are some basic information about Palau and Dong Gala located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located west of the island of Sulawesi on the brink of a narrow bay and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dong Gala Island covers an area of more than 300 km (180 mi) north-west of Sulawesi.
Regency is an administrative region with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of central Sulawesi province is mainly dependent on fishing and farming, especially the coastal area of Dong Gala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in the coastal area of Moro Valley, opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Meteorological Agency, Palo and Dong Gala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the Dong Gala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the West Dong Gala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are as follows:
2004 - A tsunami in Indonesia's northern Sumatra province on December 26 triggered another tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, killing more than half of them in Asia.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed off the coast of Sumatra on the island of Nyas.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that later hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 - A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mantawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing nearly 300 people.
2016: A mild-magnitude earthquake hits the Peddie Jaya region in Asia, causing devastation and panic as people remember the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis were reported this time, but more than 100 people were killed as a result of the collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake strikes Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily put thousands of tourists in fear.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he snatched her phone from her.
KTUU has reported that Palin has been remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and detained on an unsecured bond of $500.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday and when he was asked to defend himself, he declared himself "not guilty."
Palin faces a three-degree A misdemeanor, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with rank B's shortcomings, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Paul has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, domestic violence, and possession of a firearm.
His girlfriend had accused him of beating her in the face.
In 2016, former military groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD that escalated after her service in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication system has collapsed and the death rate is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the earthquake are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit off the coast, hundreds of people gathered for the Palo City Main Beach Festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York have called for the death penalty for the suspect in the terrorist attacks in New York that killed eight people - an occasional death penalty that has not been tried in the state against any federal crime since 1953.
Seppuo, 30, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to attack cyclists along the western side of the highway in Lower Manhattan and crushed pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
As a justification for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sipou "arbitrarily" targeted eight people and "arbitrarily" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to a warning notice to seek the death penalty in New York's southern district.
According to the court documents, both of these crimes are punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipou on 22 charges, including eight charges of systematic exploitation of Baljeber for murder, which federal prosecutors usually use in organized crime, and one of the charges was violence and the destruction of vehicles.
Prosecutors described the attack as "ghastly, cruel and thoughtless," saying the attack required "a lot of planning and thinking."
The notice said, "The family and friends of Cefolo Habibullah Ayuch Saipou, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne Laure Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Ellridge, Hernan Ferrochi, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alexandro Damian Pagnocho have been hurt, harmed and harmed."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The death penalty in the southern district of New York has been on trial for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution on a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found guilty of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago and later sentenced to death.
Both Rosen Borgs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek citizen, Sipoo, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about his actions.
According to the allegations, Sipoo told the authorities that he was affected by watching ISIS videos on his phone for the attack.
Police said he also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public prosecutor representing Sipu, said he was "really disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that seeking the death penalty rather than the life sentence, which is unlikely to be released, will be a long-lasting mental trauma for everyone involved in the incident," he said.
Sipoo's defense team had earlier told prosecutors not to call for the death penalty.
Tory's House of Representatives has said that Nigel Farage should be made in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage hinted at “motivation of the public army” during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the European Union said the politicians were "faced with anger" by opponents of the EU - when Theresa May, a member of her own assembly, suggested she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU herself.
Conservative Peter Boone, who sits in the back seat, told a march in Birmingham that if Mr. Ferragh had been Brexit secretary, Britain would have “gone out of the European Union by now.”
But Ms May is having trouble convincing members of her various positions to join a separate protest against Brexit in the city by Brexit opponents.
Despite Brexit supporters, opponents, and EU attacks, the prime minister has been trying to keep his checker-compromise plan in the right direction.
The allies insisted that they would try to advance the deal with Germany despite the fierce backlash - and force opponents and workers from the EU to choose between their package and the ‘extreme’.
Mr. Bonn said that leaving meant a Leo rally in Soli Hill through which she wanted to ‘force the Chechens’.
He suggested that Mr. Ferraj should have been co-opted and given the responsibility of having a dialogue with Germany.
He added: “If he had been in charge, the UK would have left the EU by now.”
The Welling Borough Assembly added: “I support Brexit but we have to force the checkers.”
Speaking about his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make laws in our country."
Mr Bon rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is absolutely wrong.”
Anti-Brexit Tory leader Andre Jenkins was also present in the march and he told reporters: “I am only saying: Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chickers are unpopular among the general public and the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and our workers who fill the streets choose us.
"Please listen to the naysayers."
In a special message for Mrs May, she said: “The Governor-General remains as long as he keeps his promises.”
Mr Ferraj told the rally that if the politicians were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they would have to “feel sorry and angry”.
Now it is a matter of trust between our people and our political class.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here to tell you today that we won’t allow you to do that.”
In a message for Pragesh Majumah, he said, “I want to make my political class feel sad and angry, who are on the verge of betrayal from Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of the country that brought us success in Brexit and we will not sit with China until we know how to become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small number of activists oppose Tory Brexit at the group's launch this week to wave banners.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked conservatives on security issues that occurred to him with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT system for seamless border and free border trade in Ireland and the entire technology and everything for Canada," he added.
"It's a complete wash.
He added: "There's nothing better than Brexit.
Warren plans to "deeply consider" the president's election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "focus" on running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat leader discussed his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might be able to compete with Trump in 2020.
Ever since Trump took office, he had his 36th meeting with the lawmakers on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, using the town hall format.
One of the attendees asked if she planned to contest the president's election.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government system, and that includes women in high positions."
LSU's Sims has been arrested in connection with the death by shooting.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m.
He has released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man has been identified who is calling for help.
Sam, 20, was shot dead near the southern university campus on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247sports, "Wed Sims was shot in the head and ultimately died."
Wade came forward to defend his friend, and Simpson shot at him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present at the scene with the weapon and also confessed to shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sams, a 6-foot-six-inch-tall player in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season as a first player 10 times and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: After Lewis Hamilton's victory against Sebastian Vettel in Team Orders, he became closer to the world title.
It was at that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas had qualified before Lewis Hamilton that Mercedes would play a major role in the team's Orders Race.
From the pool, Botas made a good start and almost took Hamilton ahead of him when defending his position during the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack against his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and pushed Hamilton into the traffic on the back of the pack which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later completed the lap and came in behind Vettel, but at the same time Hamilton went ahead in the race when the driver of the escapee hesitated, risking the interior by running a double trick in defense of the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the grid's back row and was in seventh position by the end of the first lap.
He then advanced to the big part of the race when he held his tyres to an immediate finish and left the deficit raccoon behind for the fourth position.
He finally came into the pits in the 44th lap, but during the remaining eight laps he failed to increase his pace when Reconnaissance took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all week and was a really good guy to let go of.
"The first two positions were excellent," Hamilton said.
These are very bad physical signs.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dean Finestein's insistence at a rally on Saturday that he had not disclosed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "demanding, disgusting and false."
"One of the things that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days is when you see anger, when you see angry, mean, disgusting, and false people," he said.
"When you see things going on and unfolding and then say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dan Finnstein, did you make the announcement?
Remember the answer... did you reveal the document - "Oh, what?
Oh no.
I didn't cheat."
Okay, hold on a minute.
He also said of the senator's views, "We have not disclosed... No, we have not disclosed."
Finestein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kiwana in July, and it was revealed in early September - but Finestein denied that the disclosure came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feynstein told the committee.
"They told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as they told me."
But their refusal was not according to the president who commented on it during Saturday's rally: "I tell you it was a very bad way.
It may not have been the best I've ever seen."
Defending his nominee for the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
"They are determined to take back all power.
"You see their shortcomings, their shortcomings, they don't care who they harm, they have to be crushed for power and control," the media reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants (Belfast Giants)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee for the Giants.
The Dandy Stars won the return match 3-5 against the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
The Giants took the lead through the first two goals of Patrick Doyer and Francis Beaulieuer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney equalized the home side before the Giants' lead was restored by Doyle.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized Dundee and later Lucas Lindold Nelson's goals ensured their victory.
This is the third defeat of the season in the elite league for Adam Koffee's players to come from a weak spot to beat Dundee 1-2 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams in which the Giants won the last three matches.
Dwyer's first goal came through Kendall McFaul's assist at 3:35 in the fourth minute, while Beaulieuer scored 4 minutes later when the lead doubled, provided by David Rutherford.
Although it was a busy start period, Matt Markwart brought home the home side back in the game at 13:10 before Cowney's second goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first break.
The home side got back together and came back on par with the Powerplay goal at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran helped Nelson to lead Dundee for the first time shortly before the second break in the match, and he ensured victory with his team's fifth goal in the last interval.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes to play their next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller gave his life to ensure that hundreds of people on board survived the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero who lost his life while ensuring that a plane full of hundreds of people flew safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have been killed and several missing in a massive earthquake that triggered a tsunami in Sulawesi on Friday.
The powerful aftershocks have spread to the area and many people are trapped under the rubble in the city of Palo.
But despite his colleagues running to save their lives, a 21-year-old Anthony Gon<0xC3><0xB3>n Agung refused to leave his post at Matiara Sas Al Jufri Airport, the heavily swinging control tower at Palo Airport.
He was there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 was flying safely, which was on the runway at the time.
Then, when he realized that the traffic control tower had started to fall, he jumped off the tower.
He later died in the hospital.
Australia's ABC News reported that Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirit said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We developed a helicopter in the Black Mansion to take it from Balkpen to another city major hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
He added: "Our hearts are saddened to hear about this.
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the country's disaster management agency says access to Dong Gala, Siege and Botong is limited.
"There is a possibility that the death toll is rising because many people were buried under the rubble and many others could not be reached," said the agency's spokesman, Stepo Provo Ngaro.
Waves reaching 6 metres have destroyed Palo where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial ships are bringing aid and supplies.
Resa Kasuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every moment an ambulance brings a body.
Clean water is scarce.
There are small markets all over the world."
John Gelfend, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working at lightning speed to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
There has already been an accident, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo Alto on Sunday and told the country's military: "I tell you all to put day and night into everything you do with regard to the withdrawal.
"Are you ready for the NFL?"
This year, an earthquake struck the Indonesian city of Lumbok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia's plane crashes: Air New Guinea says one person is missing after the Lagoon plane crashes
The airline, which operates a cruise in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, while the first airline said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the lives of other passengers and crew after they were swept away by the water in an attempt to land the ship's Cheekland Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers remained in the hospital and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy, both said the plane landed in Logan, some distance from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had gone past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane had fallen too low.
Gwen said, "That's a good thing.
Jens said he and the other passengers on the sinking ship went through an emergency evacuation route and stayed in deep water until they reached the waist.
He said the flight attendants were worried and running and that he also suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve the nearby port before the ship sank about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water also helped with rescue operations by bringing people from the water to the shore by boat.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airliner crash incidents over the past two decades, while not including Air New Guinea.
Analysts have given a timeline of the night when the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors completed their arguments in a man's retrial on Saturday, which was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cell phone records from the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis, and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, who was the victim, to collect his movements and coins on the night of his death.
Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett said he had received location data from a number of cell phones showing that Telus was with the evening chambers of his death, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during that time, Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Telus was telling the truth that he was in the truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was then in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telus said he had known him for two weeks when Chambers died.
Cell phone records indicate that they have only known each other for a week.
Raulette said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He said, "He saved my life."
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's the Big Deal?
A hip hop group of three people wants to challenge the negative perception of this type of music by adding positive messages to their music.
The Highbread, from Bristol, claimed that hip-hop has deviated from its original purpose of manipulating political messages and social issues.
They want to take it to its origin and re-populate the Bashgar hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common have seen a recent reception in the UK through artists like Akala and Loki.
There's another black hole?
Nancy, a New Yorker, filed a lawsuit after the couple was fired for a "racist" message.
A New York-based babysitter is suing the couple for discriminatory eviction after a message sent by her mother, complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denied that they were racist and expressed the possibility that the trial was aimed at receiving "tawan".
Lance Plascu Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment at the baby's new care provider, Jesel Marais, arriving on the first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plascu Flexman sent a message to her husband, "No, another black man."
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Miss Marius twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his mistake, "disappointed" Plascu Flexman fired African-American Nancy Miss Marris, saying she was not doing her job properly and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Miss Marius was given a one-day wage and then sent home via Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation and asking for up to $350 a day of the same work for six months for which she was recruited without a contract.
"I want to show them you can't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, saying it was a reasonable job to get Marius out of the job because they couldn't trust him by angering him.
"My wife sent him something he didn't intend to say.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
Do you want to give your child a gift to someone you're with, even if it's a mistake?
His unborn child?
Try to understand."
Describing the case as "tawaan," Plasco said his wife was about to become a mother of a child two months later and was "difficult to deal with."
"Are you going to follow someone like that?
"It's not a good investment," said the banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to take the couple on social media and criticize their behavior and logic.
A new letter has revealed that Paddington's publishers fear readers won't be able to match the speaking bear themselves.
Bond's daughter Karen Jinkel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard for a first-time reader to feel himself in someone else's place before it's published.
It's great to know what's behind the spectacular success of Paddington.
Talking about his father, who has worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book about a small toy bear, said he was optimistic enough about his book being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books after his death last year was "coffee bitter but sweet."
Speaking about Paddington, whom she describes as "the most important member of her family," she added that her father was extremely proud of her ultimate success.
He said: "He was a quiet man and was not arrogant.
"But because Paddington was so real to them, it's just like having a child and having that success: you're proud of them even if it's not your achievement.
I think they saw Paddington's success in something like this.
Although it was their creation and imagination, they always credited Peddington himself.
My wife was on the phone and I said goodbye.
After landing, his daughter was immediately taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where the doctor was unable to save her life.
"Ned was regularly calling to tell her that her condition was very bad and she was not expected to survive," Ms. Edwin Leprosy said.
"Then I got a call from Ned that she would die in a minute or two and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Darling, I love you so much.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines given to him to keep his heart pumping were gradually losing its effect and were coming out of his system.
He died a few years ago, and it's all over now.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to show up.
I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I was surrounded by people and family.
I really had to stand up for myself."
Eventually, Mrs. Edwin Leprosy, who was fifty-five on her daughter's death, boarded the plane with other passengers - who were alien to their suffering.
He said, "No one knows."
"My head was down and tears were dripping from my eyes all the time."
It's hard to explain, but it happened during the flight when I felt intense emotional sympathy for Ned.
I need to understand and love it.
I knew how much he loved her."
Pregnant women post suicides on the bridge.
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, which people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
She said: "I don't want to see my parents like I do every day.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in London, said her son was a gifted chef with an impressive smile.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
He always said that his smile could light up any room."
However, he left work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I've always been concerned that this thing could have an impact."
Ms. Davis made the cards, "To bring to people's knowledge that there are people in the world you can talk to, even if they're friends."
"You need to sit down and talk."
Humphreys, a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old husband Mark shortly after her mother's death.
"He never said he was depressed or upset or anything like that," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we felt a change in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he did not meet them and did nothing else."
She said her death was a great shock to them, but they had to go through it: "It creates a vacuum in the family.
It breaks us.
"We all have to fight it."

The future of Brit Kwanzaa is in the middle after the FBI investigation began.
"I wondered if we could really do something like what he's saying - an investigation that has a limited scope and time - maybe we could build some unity about it," Mr Flake said, adding that he feared the committee would be "divisive" because of partisan grouping.
Why don't Mr. Kiwana and his Republican supporters want an investigation by the FBI?
It is only because of their time.
The midterm elections on November 6 are just five weeks away - if Republicans lose badly as expected, they will be extremely weak in their efforts to elect a representative to the country's highest judiciary.
George W. Bush has been calling senators and trying to form a coalition to support Kiwana, who has worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through him, met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report comes out?
The Senate will have 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kiwana will be able to secure 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will enable Vice President Mike Pence to break the stalemate and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans has decreased.
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beung Seung, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls and high rates by smugglers were key elements between North Korea and China.
Peng made no public comments.
A large number of North Korean defectors have been granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than through the highly secure Unarmed Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back using force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at negotiating a denuclearization deal.
The meeting came after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore in June after they agreed on broad terms to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the U.S. of slowing growth since then.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Ri said, "Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a victim of "hypocrisy" and added that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the House's minority representative, called Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court, "a victim of harassment" and said he was temporarily ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi, in her response to Kiwana's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, said: "I can't do anything, but I think if a woman does something like this, she will call it 'deadly'."
Kiwana emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, when they were both young.
At the beginning of his statement, Kiwana was extremely emotional and sometimes went on and on talking about his family and high school years.
He criticized the committee's Democrats representatives for open-mouthing the allegations as a "ridiculous and coordinated attack on the character" developed by the Liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kiwana's testimony has proven she cannot serve on the Supreme Court because it has proven she is biased against Democrats.
"I think they have disqualified themselves from making such statements and criticizing the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
When Pelosi was asked if Kwanzaa was confirmed, and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, would she try to impeach it?
"I would say -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified to be in the Supreme Court, but in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kiwana is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about a possible ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roy V. Wade of Kiwana because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh deferred questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it amazing?'"
Women need to control it.
It's a sad truth that months and years go by without tears and it can't get rid of it.
After 45 years, she told me, "We cry when we're angry."
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
She continued her talk, "A woman who helped me a lot in an executive position somewhere, and she told me that she too cries when she's angry, but got a capacity which meant that when she gets angry, she starts crying, the person she talks to would say to her, "Maybe you're starting to cry because I'm depressed.
But then I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was wonderful.
Tears are allowed to partially vent out anger because they have been deemed fundamentally wrong.
One of the best memories of an early job in an office dominated by men, is where I found myself crying with inexplicable anger when I was caught by a big woman with my neck - a headdress manager who I've always been afraid of - and that pushed me to the jungle of Zen.
He told me, "Don't let others see you cry."
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they've overcome you.
Patricia Schroder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during her election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found involved in a non-marriage deal on a boat called the Minky Business and he walked out of the race, Ms. Schroeder became extremely depressed and there was no reason why she did not want to run for the presidency herself.
Thirty years later, he told me with a smile, "That wasn't a thought decision."
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Bones".
Because the campaign was too late and she was far behind in terms of fundraising, and so she vowed not to join the race until she raised $2 million.
It was a suspicious war.
They found that some of their supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give them only $250.
They asked me, "Do you think I'm being punished?"
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by emotions, thanks to those who supported him, the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target votes instead of delegations, and the sense of sexism that shocks him.
Ms Schroeder recalled the press's response to her, saying, "You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown."
"You must have felt that Clinics was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what they're going to write about in my book.
"Did they cry?"
How will the U.S.-China trade war benefit China?
According to experts, there was a lot of noise from the open doors of the trade war between the United States and China, and as the war is not over, the escalation between the two countries could be useful for China.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year to tax major Chinese exporters of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A more significant increase came this week when new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) came into effect, imposing taxes on nearly half of goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded every time it has imposed a five to ten percent tax on the most recent $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has indicated the shot in exchange for the US shot and the world's second-largest economy is currently in a state of weakening.
To force the U.S. to go back means to comply with its demands, but publicly surrendering to the U.S. would be quite embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts still say that China can keep its seals well, the pressure of the US trade war could have a positive impact on China by reducing the two countries' dependence on each other in the long run.
"The fact that an immediate political decision by either the U.S. or China can create conditions that can create economic hardship for either country is far more dangerous than what has been previously acknowledged by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Center for New American Security's Asia-focused think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ‘ready’ for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for the rebuilding of the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Alam said that the situation in the country is moving towards improvement.
"The ground situation is more stable and secure today because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is re-evaluating areas destroyed by terrorists to normalize the situation.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of the refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that damaged their homes and professions.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Alam said the Syrian government would welcome the help of rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that contributed to the coup.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
In the 2018 Ryder Cup held at Le Golf National outside Paris, France, the Europe team defeated the US team by a final score of 16.5 against 10.5.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reclaimed the title when Danish captain Thomas Beuran's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the U.S. team.
American star Phil Mickelson, who remained in trouble for the most part of the tournament, threw his T-shot into the water in the 3rd, 16th hole and lost his match to Francisco Molineari.
Italian golfer Molineri was successful in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players who have scored 5-0 after forming the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American player Jared Spieth was defeated by European team's lowest-ranked player Thor Beuran Olison by 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson suffered a 2 and 1 defeat to England's Ian Poulter, who may be playing his last Ryder Cup.
Mane Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament's most-winning European player with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't be patient with myself today.
It has been a difficult year.
Thank you for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm happy to win the cup.
It's all about the team and I'm very happy that I was able to do my part," Garcia said after the European victory.
He transferred the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a game on Sunday.
Ram, 23, said: "I'm proud to beat Tiger Woods, I've grown up seeing this guy."
Woods lost all his matches in France and now holds a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Among the greatest players of all time, players are odd figures who have won all the major 14 awards since Jack Nicholson.
In addition to high-quality golf players Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fanau throughout the tournament, the U.S. team struggled to find ease throughout the week.
U.S. captain Jim Foreck said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these players, they tried."
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on the European players.
But we have failed.
It's good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll be together again, I'll work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to captain them.
You have to appreciate it.
We had a good game."
Red wave update: reduced concentrations in Penelope, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission are showing a general decline in red-wave activity in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, conditions such as Pichiblom have been reported in the areas of Pallas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a decrease in concentrations.
A full-blown red wave extends approximately 130 miles from the coast of northern Penelope to southern Le Counties.
The Patches Hills are 10 miles off the coast of Borough County, but can be seen in fewer locations than last week.
The red wave has also been seen in Pasco County.
Last week average concentrations in Penelope County or near the coast, maximum concentrations near the coast of Hillsborough County, background to greater concentrations in Manatee County, background to near the coast in Sara Suta County, background to greater concentrations in Charlotte County, background to more concentrations in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory problems are still ongoing in the Pineals, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There were no reports of any respiratory problems in northwestern Florida last week.
