The fast-growing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should ramp up their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases with unknown diagnosis-science were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while in the remaining 6% cases there is an observation of a severe disease requiring serious care.
The mortality rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK during 31 January - 15 March 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, the further geographical expansion of COVID-19 took place and the current COVID-19 pandemic activity in the rest of the world moved ahead of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date.
Gaining cumulative numbers and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, the National and Regional Health Authority and the World Health Organization (WHO) are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated a brief cumulative prevalence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country up to 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020 compared to Italy in the period 31 January – 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in the EU/EEA Countries and the UK
The 14-day short cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and across the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and rapidly increased around 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar growing trend (supplementary content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy in the period January 31 - March 15, 2020.
It specifically shows that as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported the total number of cases comparable to Italy's cases only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite the variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients, which must be necessarily tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
The figures for hospitalization and/or intensive care unit of COVID-19 cases are currently only available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% cases respectively (the figures are not shown).
They should however be collected in a methodical manner to supplement the current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010–11 study found a significant difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Intensive care bed capacity <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 90% risk-related hospitalisation prevalence of COVID-19 cases with estimates for every EU/EEA country and the UK <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Implication of conditions related to health care capacity saturation is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Intensive Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
As cases remain in herds in EU/EEA countries and some areas of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units serve the generally defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, with a change in approach to mitigation from limiting, a faster, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, because if not implemented in time, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may lead to the decision makers and hospitals not to understand, accept and adapt their response to the time provided accordingly.
The Acute Risk Assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have very few opportunities to further increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is very likely that the health care systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a rapid increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a disaster for humans.
Similar to its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted by bats and produce similar symptoms by baggage mechanism.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects older people and men more than women than young people.
In response to the number of rapidly growing publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, for-science, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While there are still a lot of questions to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate the deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who have been requested to stay at home for a full holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the outbreak of Novel Viral Disease.
The virus is very similar to coronavirus (CoV) which led to the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and the related disease was named COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread to the whole country and about 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 deaths due to the virus.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "people's enemy number 1" and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment, leading to the sequence of the virus being isolated from many patients.
This review attempts to summarize research progress on new and rapidly evolving subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some of the much-needed questions we have learned so far.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, with mainly producing about 15% of the common cold.
However, in this century we have encountered twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1, swarms of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the CoV was released.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
During this time, the pandemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infection was reported in health care providers, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed under lockdown with all its public traffic shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation is growing rapidly, the final extent and intensity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
A multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, on 11 February 2020 presented a more up-to-date depiction of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly between the ages of 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over the age of 50, much less under the age of 20, and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected rose sharply before 23 January 2020, which coincided with widespread traffic ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and veiled viruses with single-stranded RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The cover tip (S) joins glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4), respectively, and then merges with the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the casing forms genomic RNA virion-containing plaques with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then merged into the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequenced samples collected from Wuhan's Wuhan seafood market, the epicentre of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-monthly segments of human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2, SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV were found to be effective.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with a greater vulnerability than SARS-CoV which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
Novels coded by SARS-CoV-2, orf3b, can also form tiny proteins and secreted proteins coded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in viral pathogenicity and block the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in a mixture with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which contained free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimmer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could combine two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and transmission of CoVs.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and Intermediate Nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels, respectively.
By racial comparisons to other CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, bats were considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient helped infect humans by crossing the virus's species barrier is unknown and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that included similar recombination with the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolins - often long-smoothed, ant-eating mammals found in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity in SARS-CoV-2 and CoVs found in pangolins.
However, the spread of the 1% difference across both genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in artificial ambient dry environments for up to 48 hours and less than 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and at 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays for 30 minutes at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chlorophyll.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, after the virus enters the host, it is for the first time C-type lactin-like receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that carry the innate immune system of the host.
By various pathways, the expression of virus inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFNs) induces which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can aid the virus in avoiding immune responses.
Soon, the optimized immune response becomes involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T supporting cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoVs can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Trichotillomania resistance, including supplements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, immunosuppressants isolated from the recovered patient deactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system generates a very large number of locally free particles that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and also multiorgan failure and death in the worst conditions.
Older people with SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by early onset in the herd, and pregnant women are more likely to be affected.
It is common that people who are exposed to a higher number of viruses or whose immune functions are mixed are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases observed that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases observed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing the virus from transmitting to other people of infected but symptomatic people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who have come in contact with or have been infected with the virus usually need a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the major and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nauseous, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly increased the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and pulmonary arterial abnormalities should also be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing difficulty and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Two recent studies of herds generated by transmission from family herds and symptomless individuals reported similar findings.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing difficulty (55%) as the main symptom.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them required ventilation support and this is consistent with MERS' greater lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in patients with MERS.
It has been observed in SARS patients that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
The COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% as of February 14, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
By comparison, as of November 2002, the fatality rate of SARS was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a June 2012 demographic study.
Earlier studies reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 times higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The herd usually begins with a single family or a single group of people or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected persons or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the start.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from the hospital can again transmit the virus, which warns of an extension of the quarantine time.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphatic cells) in patients at an early stage is normal or low.
For example, lymphatic cell count 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L including white blood cell count &lt; 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with lymphopenia and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and virulence were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Blood levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in some patients, and c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, a product of the fibrin collapse present in the blood, the level of de-diamer, was increased and lymphatic cell count continued to decline.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are represented by bilateral blurred images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, mass accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the surface tension and thus reduces the ability of the lungs to swell and increases the risk of stopping lung function.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often remain in parallel with the most serious condition of the disease.
The first epidemiological analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 looked at the vulcanization of pneumocytes in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, the formation of hyaline membranes and porous leakage of lymph cells, and the multinucleic multicentric cells that corresponded to the pathology and ARDS of viral infections and was similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transceptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis in China on February 13, 2020 (which was no longer dependent on RT-PCR alone).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations and radiological findings is necessary and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which is 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L without the need for any detailed equipment, using a dipstick. Artificially detecting SARS-CoV-2 at 10-100 mol/L (10-100 <0xCE><0xBC>V per microliter of input)
If clinical samples are verified, the hope is that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to a lack of experience with Novel CoV, clinicians may provide primarily supportive care to COVID-19 patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases previously used or proposed treatments (table 2).
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, current and potential treatments with Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
There is a competition among pharmaceutical companies to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and possibly other organs in the lower range, which express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Still, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain major threats to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory aid is important for relieving symptoms and saving lives and it includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-entry ventilation and enteric mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), modified heart-lung subcutaneous technique used in the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and protecting the function of septic shock, and vital organs are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm occurs as a result of excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunodeficiency is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinin storm include changes in T cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatomeb; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid as an immune suppressant, was widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of the steroid were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects while dramatically affecting disease-diagnosis, especially non-vascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, short-term course of corticosteroids at low to medium doses are recommended to be used with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given in the vein, has been found to be effective in an American patient of COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed possible inhibition of other asteroid RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
Also, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, iopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Joint therapy with iopinavir/ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
Interactions with other drugs used in these treatments should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and Immune Production from Recovered Patients
There has been a long history of aggregation of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has a high level of immunity relative to the pathogen.
The antibodies produced by B lymph cells to fight pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and deactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
With low inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood, their symptoms improved within 24 hours.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method to be used on a larger scale.
At the same time, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies so rapidly to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes for effective antibodies or to check for effective antibodies to the virus's essential proteins.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in a different formula depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or meaningless because it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe stages due to lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Xu Feng Jie Du Capsules and Lian Hua Qing Ven Capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
Among the 87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), many provinces in China saw the highest recovery rates in COVID-19 treatment, while Hubei province, where TCM was used only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zheng and colleagues published studies to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatment and combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the body temperature in the WM<0x2B>TCM group was significantly lower than in the WM group alone, the time required for symptoms to return to normal, and for hospitalization.
Most impressive, the WM<0x2B>TCM group had significantly lower symptomatic rates (lightly severe) than the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more controlled trials at larger levels and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the system of actions and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 experience a lot of fear from the highly contagious and deadly disease and those quarantined also experience dullness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, short-oxidation, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more restlessness and mental agony.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, several psychiatric diseases were reported, including constant stress, restlessness, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, mental symptoms, depression, even suicide.
Finding and quarantine mandatory contacts as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak; touching people, quarantine and stigmatization on their families and friends can make them more restless and glamorous.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and individuals who have come in contact with them, as well as to the general public.
Psychological support should include setting up of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates about the outbreak and treatment plans of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for disrupting the chain of transmission from zoonotic funds and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often supplemented by antiviral treatments in the control of epidemics due to the increasing number of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful inactivated immune and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-tainted vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS.
However, the vivo efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and deadly challenging variants and their protection against zoonotic virus infections are still to be determined before any clinical study begins.
This is probably the reason why SARS ended slowly 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and herds of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the areas of the pandemic.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using sub-units of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunised persons is an essential and critical task for controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, the long-term requirement (on average 18 months) in vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs make it challenging to overcome the difficulty.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to create disease-diagnosis replicas to determine the priority of their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies so far reported, the following factors may affect or relate to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% were patients over the age of 50, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and who did not have such a need were significantly older than they were (at a median age of 51 versus 66), indicating age as a predictive factor of outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men than women have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytitis which can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have deep correlations and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been proposed as a potential predictive factor for disease, medical response and eventually recovery.
The severity of COVID-19 and the correlation of CRP levels to disease-diagnosis have also been proposed.
At the same time, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are free during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: Periodic progress of chest radiography and clinical symptoms with other problems should be considered for forecasting the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as concomitant therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with lifelong disability and poor life quality.
Therefore, if needed, the steroid should be used in COVID-19 patients for low doses and short-term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often witnessed the long duration and extreme uncertainty of quarantine and the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is extremely important to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to the demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
As well as replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and produce mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, like other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of the virus during daily activities in the early stages or incubation period, with much difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to have occurred when the patients were very ill, while most transmissions did not occur during the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
In the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and nearby cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the ups and downs of the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the ups and downs phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more infectious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 recovered and was identified in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who left the hospital 2 weeks ago indicating that the identified new virus, like influenza, could become a recurring case.
However, there have been promising signs from China based on the decreasing number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to have one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in infectivity and eventually ends up becoming a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic to SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible from coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in feces, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing other diseases and 40 health care providers, were likely due to clinical infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect people, especially those who are in contact with people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series <0x23> 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from potentially infected person to air or from sticking to the surface of things from which they can pass to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23> 1860s) masks, with only 5% of the virions being completely crossed, can prevent as many as 10 to 80 nm of virions from entering the respiratory tract; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can also cross five surgical masks placed one above the other, health care providers with direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series <0x23> 1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person with the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body with his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face coverings or glasses while working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and possibly limit contact with infected individuals.
Three feet is considered a reasonable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as the new virus to the human world, as reported on January 7, 2020, due to the extreme similarity with SARS-CoV it would have highly cautioned China based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited fertility and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message freed the public of great fear, especially when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival and there was a delicate time to limit the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be careful when making public announcements (1) because every word counts for citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) continue to be more sensitive and responsive to the practice of unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from physicians or authorities; (3) continue to be more responsive to the practice of the clinicians; and (3) increase awareness of the public rather than attempt to console the public; and (4) be more restrictive to limit the potential pandemic to the initial stage.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world by the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the repeated occurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for limiting the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than younger people, and the severity and mortality rates in the elderly are also higher than in younger people.
The fatality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless, while SARS patients often do so when they are critically ill, which causes much more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and with prevalence than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases are yet to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-like CoVs, we still can't come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species in transmission of the virus from bats to humans?
Without figuring out the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we can’t effectively stop the broadcast and there can be any recurrence of the outbreak.
Although molecular simulation and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and then make pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-individual cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot have a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it end slowly like SARS or will it continue to happen periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the price has to be paid, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have led to the simultaneous development of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) over a period of thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease such as colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the destructive and lethal nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back to light and surprised us with a more contagious but declining pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will be our job.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
There is also information about the intermediate cell nutrients of some HCoVs.
Animal nutrient identification has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Checking the interaction of CoV-nutrients in animals can also give important insight into the pathogenicity of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current information about the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of the discovery, as well as the zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the point of view of the gradual development of viruses and gene recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this perspective of the pandemic.
At the same time, the need to successfully change the nutrients and the implications of the gradual development of the virus on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the coronavirus family that includes clusters of infected, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which harbor the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses, were named "CoVs" because of the crown-like morphology beneath the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unbroken genomes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab reactase polyproteins.
Polypropylene is further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spikes (S), invelop (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many lineage-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation consists mostly of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Psoriatic evidence has shown that bats and mice are mostly gene sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major cells of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently crossed species barriers and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a higher likelihood of hyperplasia are highly pathogenic in relatively more patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal drift of patients with colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, further information about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 has been collected by detailed studies, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that the infection of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%, is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world has to prepare for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Many evidence supports the gradual development of all HCoVs from bats, including viruses that are well-adapted and non-pathogenic, but show highly genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Detecting the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides the framework for understanding the natural history, motivator power and bonding factors of species crossing.
It can guide or facilitate the discovery of nutrient(s) of SARS-CoV-2 with significant impact in preventing future proliferation.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural cell nutrients, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission in the new host.
We will also review the trend of the gradual development of HCoVs in which the increase in infectiousness is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E breed first isolated from nasal drift of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from many infected animals, including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decade.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of the discovery of HCoVs (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which later adapted to grow into the WI-38 lung cell lines.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, 10<0x7E>20% of the cases showed symptoms of cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the successive pathways in the brain of the milking rat and from organ enhancement.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E that is symptomaticly indistinguishable from infection with influenza A virus and other respiratory tract pathogens such as rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and are likely to be transmitted predominantly during the winter with the warmer weather.
Usually, the duration of the gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2-week illness.
According to a study by human volunteers, mild colds developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few patients with immunocompromised have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," was the first well-documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history, and the factor for this was discovered the third HCoV, SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
With the outbreak of the SARS epidemic spreading to many countries and continents, 8,096 cases were reported with 774 deaths.
In addition to the most widespread, it was estimated that nearly two secondary cases could increase due to each case with a gradual growth period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral effect appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, initially symptoms such as muscle soreness, headache, fever, malaise and cold appear, followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress appear as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, degenerative liver function testing and increased creatine kinase are common abnormalities related to the laboratory of SARS.
Circulating aerosol damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation later.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be especially deadly for patients with disabilities in the immune system.
The virus was first isolated from the relative of the indicator patient from the open biopsy of the lung that travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, much effort has been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found to have spread to immunocompromised patients with young children, the elderly and respiratory diseases.
It is common to have colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
In the second independent study, an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands described the separation of the same virus from the nasal sample.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its peak incidence occurs during the early summer, spring, and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive larynx-inflammation, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old elderly man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis found in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be related to severe asthma suppression.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have become well adapted in humans and are generally less likely to mutate to produce highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as happened in the more toxic sub-type rare case of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and sustain themselves in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, with acute pneumonia and kidney failure developing.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary prevalence in close relatives have been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea.
Clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute kidney failure, which has so far only been seen in MERS in diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported, with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end, swarms of pneumonia patients related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an international public health emergency of concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as suffocation, cough, and respiratory distress.
In some patients, diarrhea is also seen.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly increase as acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they come in different branches of racial descent.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible.
Asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 to the other six HCoVs and looking at the asymmetry have shown very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the incubation period and duration of the process of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 shows features that are usually observed during infection with HCoVs acquired from the community, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also sees community-acquired HCoVs and characteristic variants of both SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infection of SARS-CoV-2 decreases as cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV progress in humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
Whether rectal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least some conditions, like SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 community can treat seasonal like cases of HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infectiousness, pathogenicity, and persisting proliferation after entering humans, will be influential on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs, acquired from all four communities that produce mild symptoms, have become well adapted in humans.
From another point of view, it may also be correct that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may be survivors of ancient HCoV epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that develop serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, the accumulation of customized mutations that prevent nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infected, the more likely it becomes fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission in humans from quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not require animal cells.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and their transmission cannot be maintained in humans.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic cell and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least in the present time it is very contagious like the community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any cell or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before discussing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs, it would be of great use to us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, cell, intermediate and enhancing nutrients of HCoVs.
An animal is a nutrient with a gradual development of HCoV if it harbours a very close ancestor with a high similarity sharing at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well-optimized and non-pathogenic in this nutrient.
In the same way, the kosh nutrients give HCoV shelter continuously and for a long time.
In both conditions, the follicles become infected naturally and are natural hosts of HCoVs or its parental viruses.
In contrast, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient right before or around the entry into humans, it is not well adapted to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of nutrient by temporarily replicating the virus and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of infection.
If an HCoV cannot keep its transmission within the intermediate host, it can go into an end-transmission.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and maintain long-term localization.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural cell nutrient.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the indicative case of SARS had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence tests indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV than the general public.
In the live animal markets, masked palm civets (Paguma larvae) and raccoon dogs were identified as convenors of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the civets of the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most of the masked palm civets in the wild or farms, not exposed to the live animal markets, were SARS-CoV negative, which makes it clear that masked pulsive civets can only be severe as a mid-growing nutrient and not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the various animals in the markets of Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, these possibilities cannot be ruled out that many species of small mammals may also be intermediate-enhancing nutrients of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the final nutrient of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of the natural animal nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV called SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Chinese Horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with CoVs, SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the nutrient for emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none other than WIV1 have been isolated as living viruses.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a receptor of SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 extracted from samples of bat feces was demonstrated to use bats, civets and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of healthy SARS patients was able to deactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV19 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV.
Racial analysis groupes MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bats use the same nutrient-receptor, dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus entry.
The RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are racially close to the bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the closest cell nutrient to MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that hunched camels like camels of Middle East origin in many African countries are seropositive towards MERS-CoV-specific inactivation antibodies.
The live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of hump camels, indicating that camels are the authentic reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth mentioning that camels that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have generally seen mild but very high virus clearance.
Notably, infected camels remove viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the faecal-oral route, which is also the main route for the virus to be removed from bats.
However, questions still remain as there is no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms of many confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or any unknown transmission pathways that include species of animals that harbour MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity with CoV RaTG13 bats separated from bats belonging to the Rhinolophus species.
Similar to cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine the ancestral relationship.
That is, bats cannot be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical bat CoVs are found in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 should be from one of the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of Huanan seafood to which several early cases of COVID-19 were linked, indicating a possible human transmission phenomenon from animals.
A number of recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanica) may also harbor parental beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are in two subgenres of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the genomic lineage, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse, despite more sequence similarity across the genome.
An earlier study of the diseased pangolin also reported the discovery of a group of viral overlapping DNA from lung samples, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a number of different conjugated methods and manual curations to generate a partial genome sequence with a full-length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also less than SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Where the highest sequence homology has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the excessive similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergence gradual development.
An alternative proposal is in favor of recombination between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The nearest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Psoriatic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E bats may have originated from CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that the bat named ARCOV.2 (Applechain Ridge CoV) found in three North American bats had a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although camelids are also its suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, the summary of current information on the zoonotic origin of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Racial analysis has provided evidence of interethnic transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was seen.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
The bat alpha-CoVs have been found very close to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-CoV between them.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
Earlier, humans did not have contact with bats in the shared ecological habitat of Alpaca.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Ultimately, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpaca HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs are derived from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it’s not more surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha-CoVs are gene pools of HCoV-229E, alpacas and hump camels can be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to hump camels and hump camels to humans.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known on its primary identification and is further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission of genetic fractions.
Long life, dense settlements, close social interaction and excessive ability to fly are favorable conditions for all bats to be the ideal "virus broadcasters."
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has penetrated hump camels for several decades.
It has become well adapted in these camels that have been transformed from an intermediate nutrient to a stable and natural choline nutrient.
MERS-CoV produces very mild diseases and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has a sporadic transmission accident in humans and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the final host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, like civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or denied in future studies.
First, bats can be the host of almost the same SARS-CoV-2-related virus cells as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitats with bats by killing, or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate-enhancing nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus had newly entered.
Humans become infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
Survey of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in the third species, which is associated with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being discovered.
In addition to the variety of animal nutrients, three major factors with regard to virality are also important in easily crossing the species barriers of CoV.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-tap RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV with an average replacement rate of <0x7E>10-4 replacement per site per year can be considered "high" than "moderate", depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in new hosts.
CoVs have a proof-reading exobibonuclease, the deletion of which can also lead to extreme variability and depletion or a reduction in life capacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir, is believed to suppress the replication of CoVs by this exocybonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than their nutrient levels.
Also, mutation rates are often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, indicating a higher level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another nutrient closer to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV which has become well adapted to humpback camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, large RNA in CoVs puts additional plasticity on genome mutations and genome changes for recombination, increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by abundant unique open reading frames and coded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs change randomly over and over again during RNA replication by a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
In a nutrient that acts as a mixture character, filament changes often occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Extremely similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and generate new CoVs.
Rare evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the virus-feeder with respect to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the nutrient receiver is another important factor affecting intercaste transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interethnic transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of the differences between human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV with mutations specifically on the RBD of S protein is thought to be rapidly adapting to various nutrients.
Usually, the RBD in a CoV’s S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is chosen by the nutrient immune response with intensification.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 segment that binds to human ACE2 for viral entry as well as its co-conspirators.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons, leading to interspecies transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were isolated from human and civet viral isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding parenthesis for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The RBD of civet SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements can be important in optimizing viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, the cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attractiveness of this joint than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine if another co-recipient will be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Many other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silicic acids for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
The result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to cellular receptors.
The variation of these nutrients between humans and natural cell nutrient of HCoVs, such as bats, humpback camels, and mice, can hinder interspecies transmission.
The successful interethnic transmission of HCoVs has to reverse the nutrient dependence factors and the nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants are yet to be identified and described in this important area of virus-nutrient interaction.
Non-biased genome-wide testing of the nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful using the latest technology of CRISPR.
The emergence of Novel HCoVs: return to the original base
The variety of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as gene cells of CoVs, HCoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoVs and serve two important stages in the process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the potential to change the viral symmetries of acquisition or loss a lot.
In SARS-CoV supporting proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to codify diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs has been characterised by isolated strains at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks down ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptation mutation that promotes the replacement of cells.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoV lineages, identifying a very large number of small recombination regions in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in hunched camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be borne in mind that artificial selection can cause unintentional changes in the viral genome, possibly due to viruses free of election pressure, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide deletions.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, causing a frameshift.
Finally but not less important, the gradual development of Novel HCoVs also occurs due to the election pressure in their shell nutrients.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs that indicate mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats have become structurally and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
Additionally, the inhibitory natural malignant cell activity in bats is suppressed by the regulation of the natural malignant cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression level of the major tissue conformance complex class I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from greater metabolic activity of bats can lead to suppression of CoV replication and affect proof readings by exoribenuclides, thus providing selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when entering the new nutrient.
More pathogenic CoV breeds can also develop through recombination, which can lead to new protein or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic in cell nutrients such as bats and camels or cause mild symptoms.
They replicate strongly without showing a strong nutrient-resisting reaction.
It hides the secret of why symptomless carriers are seen and what causes severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to the immune response and overactivation of the cytokine storm, are caused by the more severe the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in symptomatic carriers, the immune response is separated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy to isolate the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon reaction is particularly rapid in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
From this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 influenza with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common theme that led to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoV has a 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has a 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals have been seen in markets sheltering viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the nearest intermediate nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolins may be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fractions in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remained, there was no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come under discussion due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the zoonotic corpus of HCoVs in zoonotic origin and standard transmission.
Proven evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the origin bats and transmission in humans is by intermediate nutrients.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civet there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the weight market to prevent zoonotic transmission due to the discovery of several lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs fairly close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has penetrated hump camels for several decades.
These camels are an important source of traffic for locals as well as major sources of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to abandon all camels to control MERS as it did in China's wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to generate outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in wild animals.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will have a functional development and recombination, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some regions of China should be abandoned.
With the tough test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response planning should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural shell until there is no chance of spreading.
Although bats have many features that aid in the spread of viruses, if people are educated about how to stay away from bats, the possibility of human contact with them and other wild species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts which will prove useful in preventing human transmission and future outbreaks from animals.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is to keep humans away from the ecological habitats of natural cells of zoonotic viruses.
Many parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be made clear how it interacts with various species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrient in the future.
Continuous testing in this area will clarify the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant effects in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick consultation guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides a fair reference to our experience and the worldwide fight against this pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest clinical criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest diagnoses and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has now officially been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the ultra-acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and which have been published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since its release.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostics and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
For example, a total of seven editions have been released by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 with fundamental changes in some contexts in the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
Now that a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guideline, they have introduced a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also made valuable references to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), any one item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations in order to perform a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case, or three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence history in the Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where symptomatic COVID-19 cases were reported within the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported within the previous 14 weeks, or cases reported within the previous 2 days of contact with the household (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) cases of contact with fever or respiratory symptoms from the Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes in the early stages.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case containing one of the items of pathogenic or serial proof which are as follows: (1) the active phase <0xE2><0x89><0xA5> positive for SARS-CoV-2, the real-time PCR test positive; (2) the viral full genome sequencing is showing high symmetry of the known novel coronaviruses; (3) the specific IgM for SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identification of the blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serial evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications were based on the ongoing work of the researchers who search for samples of the respiratory system, including an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for quick diagnosis, as well as blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and support bringing specific immune positive results to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a lot of evidence that reminds us to be careful with undiagnosed symptomatic and narcissistic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest locating and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update their guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new COVID-19 deaths in Bangladesh, highest ever single-day tally
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest number of deaths due to the virus in a single day so far.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a record number of infected cases, including 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported so far.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Mirzadi Sabrina Flora reported that four men and one woman have died.

Transportation of essential items like medical items, fuel and food was not banned.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in the wife of two people who returned from Italy on March 8 and one of them.
On March 19, all three of them had recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeds one million
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded one million.
COVID-19 has been linked to at least 52,000 deaths.
The day this figure crossed, the first coronavirus infection was reported in Malawi and the first death from coronavirus in Zambia was reported on the same day.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it was among the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) Central European time on April 4.
The United States has recorded more than 2,44 thousand cases of coronavirus, and it has killed at least 5,900.
CBS News quoted data from Johns Hopkins University as saying that more than 1,000 people have died in the United States from coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced even more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians would continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.

Stores in Australia reduce the number of toilet paper that can be bought at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time in all their stores nationally to two and one package, respectively.
Aldi also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages at checkout sites and on the Facebook pages of the series.
Buyers are reported to have been shopping together for a situation where they need to keep themselves isolated due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the limit of buying toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles reported in his March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban coming into force, "the stock is still running out of stock within an hour of delivery in many stores," and called this demand unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unprecedented" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, there was a "strong surge" in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra had also limited the volume to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered more large packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI raised stocks to provide early on the pre-planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers should try to increase stock, but it becomes difficult to do so due to restrictions imposed by the local council on the timing of truck delivery.
In such a situation, when the suppliers are trying to meet the demand and the number of specials has already reduced, Russell is expected to increase the production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock was released prematurely, some stores may not be able to conduct Wednesday specials.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, reported that stores fill up stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it is not stocked in large numbers, and then, when all the stock is sold, the large shelves are left empty, making the feeling of shortage even more harsh.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, “The idea of Coles and Woolworths [that] if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizers could go [buy] and be present in large quantities, the disturbance could possibly have been mitigated.”
Hue Gives a Crap, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that his stock had run out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberley-Clark, the company that manufactures the Cleanx toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, the company that manufactures the sorbent, said they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that in Melbourne, where there are already fewer auctions due to buyers holidaying on the long weekend of Labor Day, some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidders at the auction.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, contained an eight-page insert that was cut and given to be used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, stores were initially unwilling to impose restrictions; in the report, they said they had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, a 12-roll two-pack limit was also imposed on the purchase of Andres toilet paper online at the British supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a global pandemic.
Although the term “global pandemic” only means how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
"All countries can change the course of this global pandemic right now.
If the country detects the disease in response to it, treat patients, keep them isolated, trace them and unite them," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
"We are deeply concerned by both the alarming level of spread and severity and the alarming level of inaction."
According to Dr Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented."
In comments published by CNN in February, he said, “No other respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected in any of the persistent global outbreaks.”
Gabrielis also expressed a similar view when he said, “We have not seen a global pandemic caused by any coronavirus till date.”
"And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new global pandemic has come after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak an international public health emergency in January.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, “One hundred things, it’s going to get worse.”
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths, the Associated Press reported.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate in China has been estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace threat controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has created serious global socio-economic chaos, prompted the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and caused widespread shortages in supplies from panic buying by people.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed on a nationwide or local basis, affecting about 99.4% of the world's population of students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been instances of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, East and Southeast Asian origin and other people of color, and others from areas with more virus cases.
Low travel and heavy industry closures have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) reported mass cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of Hunan seafood and therefore the virus is considered to be of a zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-spreading virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was later identified to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the latter had no apparent association with the mass market group.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post reported that one case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that with a decrease in new cases in China, there was a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China exceeded the number of new cases for the first time within China.
Very little information of cases may have been recorded, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported in young people, of whom 19 years of age and under were 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Wallace, the chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before an effective group would receive immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and those who have been tested positive as per official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused nearly 97,000 deaths.
In China, as of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, in general, refers to those who have been found positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be very high, as it may not include people who die without testing, such as at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Italy's partial statistics found that the additional death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "we know that [the so-called death toll] has been estimated", a statement that is supported by descriptive information of low counts in the U.S. Such numerology often occurs in epidemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the amount of mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In China, the death-to-case ratio is estimated at 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from January 1-10, 2020) down to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that started after February 1, 2020). Other measures include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), indicating the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease dying, and infection mortality (IFR), who have not been infected with a disease.
These statistics are not timed and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is in line with the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final period of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"When left unchecked, infectious outbreaks generally stabilize and begin to decrease when there are no available nutrients for the disease," said Macy's Boney of Penn State University.
But it's almost impossible to make any sensible guesses about when that will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could end by June" if all countries followed the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 is "potentially going to be circulating for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required “until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)”.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, as it spreads very easily" and that it could "turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The severity of the return group will depend on the range of immunity and mutations.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and people infected can be narcissistic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cough), decreased sense of smell, shortness of breath, bloating, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea, diarrhea or nymphism. According to the WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden twitching, difficulty waking up, and blue of the face or lips; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms are present. More development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued advice that close contacts with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked to ward off the infection.
The Chinese estimate of the narcissistic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19, who had lost their sense of smell, was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly by small droplets generated during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that the droplets can go from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) without coughing.
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets generated during speaking that last longer in the air. Breath droplets can also be generated when breathing out, including when talking, although the virus is not airborne in general.
Drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through inhalation into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and cardiovascular pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause cataract of respiratory secretion and thus airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may be spread by feces, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease for three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible before developing important symptoms.
Only a few reports of narcissistic cases confirmed in the laboratory are present, but narcissistic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. The virus lives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for a day, and on copper for four hours.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can pass from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which decomposes its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the group of the genus Betacoronavirus, subspecies Sarbecovirus (Genetic B) with two bat-derived genera.
It is 96% similar to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
In comparison to the entire genome so far, the normal genetic content between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient to certify pangolins as intermediate nutrients.
The infection by the virus can be detected temporarily depending on the symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of the infected secretion.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its many image features are less specific with similar to other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a primary test to check for or diagnose COVID-19."
The WHO has published a number of RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which has been released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
In general, this test is performed on the nasogastry pheasant, but a throat phlegm can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests detecting antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characteristic image characteristics on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and absent lung secretion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to the similarity with other infections such as adenoviruses, there is a limited specificity of imaging in identifying COVID-19, without being confirmed by the PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent the transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, avoiding touching hands, eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and putting that tissue directly into the trash can.
People who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised all non-essential travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community don’t know where and how they got infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are recommended to follow standard precautions, take contact precautions, and protect the eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data of mobile phones by governments for this purpose has increased privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about infection prevention methods are spreading; for example, rubbing the nose and rubbing the mouthwash is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty; before eating; and after brushing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
Additionally, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions including 62–71% ethanol, 50–10%) isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine (within a minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick individuals should be disinfected if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at an office or day care facility.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then immediately dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who can become infected, as the amount of airborne droplets from talking, sneezing and coughing while wearing a mask may be limited and the distance to be covered.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.” Masks are also recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
The WHO recommends wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by ordinary healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all people entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a face mask when going to public places.
Since mid-March, Taiwan, which produces 10 million masks per day, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses on April 1.
While Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask while going out, it has also been recommended to make a face mask made at home for those who cannot buy a face mask.
Facial masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control functions, which aim to slow down the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now making it mandatory or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum population recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was sharply reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later up to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people. The aim is to make distance between elderly adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune system "to reduce the risk of serious disease and complications in the face of physical illness", and they are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks and end of March 2020.
The use of the term “making social distance” led to implications that, instead of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means, should adopt full social isolation. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations for having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have symptoms of a virus or virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The most stringent self-quarantine guidelines have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently moved to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are prevention or suppression, and mitigation.
Immunization is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at detecting infected people as well as implementing other measures and vaccinations to control the infection to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts go into the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
Both prevention and mitigation measures can be combined at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, so that the pandemic can be reversed by reducing the original reproductive number to 1. Part of managing the outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services crashing and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that can manage outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, face masking and self-quarantine; strict community measures intended for physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling mass gathering programs; when there was greater community involvement in such interventions to encourage acceptance and participation; as well as cleaning of surfaces such as environmental measures.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished hoarding of medical supplies. Imitations for Great Britain and the United States show that there are major challenges in mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic but not stopping it) and suppression (turning the development of the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by two-thirds and death by half, but even after these, hundreds of people die and health systems collapse.
Suppression can be prioritized, but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is first), otherwise the transmission returns sharply from the dysfunction in the measures.
Long-term interventions for the suppression of the pandemic generate social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold-cold medicines without prescription, drinking fluids and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The consequences can be worse with the use of steroids.
Many compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity for the needs of COVID-19 patients and optimizing health care has been described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and WHO’s European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources at multiple levels for hospitals and primary health care services, including: focusing on laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling selective procedures whenever possible, isolate and isolate COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing available ventilators and beds.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the wholesale market of Hunan sea-food, in which living animals were also sold, and one view is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of animal origin. The pneumonia group with unknown cause was seen on December 26 and was treated by the physician Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who was diagnosed on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Police warned eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, of spreading false rumours and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Quite a few cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan, which resulted in an investigation initiated in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to Chinese New Year movement and being the Wuhan transport hub and major rail exchange.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official statistics show that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the US has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have banned free movement and established border controls.
National responses include quarantine measures (staying orders at home, shelter orders at your place, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the U.S. or about 90% of the population are in some form of lockdowns, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdowns, around 59 million people are in lockdowns in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdowns.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of a lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion people two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report shows that the first case occurred on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixian noticed a group of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jiangan CDC on December 27.
An early genetic test of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Following the arrival of these information, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police to "spread rumours" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission had initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a furious campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was called a "people's war" by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping.
Described as the "biggest quarantine in human history," a siege zone was announced in Wuhan on January 23, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoskinson Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later another hospital, Leishenson Hospital, was built to handle additional patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities such as conference centers and stadiums into temporary hospitals in Wuhan. On January 26, the government established additional measures to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks, including issuing health declarations for passengers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau established a number of measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely were established in many Chinese areas.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was revised, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movement was imposed in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external restriction. After the outbreak hit its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "coming" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, only one case was transmitted domestically in mainland China in the last five days, in this example through a passenger returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of cases transmitted domestically has been basically stopped and the outbreak in China has been controlled.
Travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, on the same day two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders will be suspended from 28 March, as well as no specific details on when this policy will expire.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning on April 4, at 10:00 a.m., beginning with a three-minute national silence, which was at the time of the Qingming festival, although the central government asked families to pay homage online while observing physical distancing to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
The spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to a surge in crowds in a new religious movement known as Jesus' Shinchinoji Church.
Shinchiyanji devotees coming from Wuhan were suspicious of the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 of the 9,336 followers of the church reported symptoms, or about 13%. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined when tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline programs were also affected and so were changed. The program that South Korea introduced was considered to be the largest and best organized program in the world to check the population for the virus and isolate any infected people, as well as to detect and quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-indication of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, quick testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, or praised his response, claiming the government's ill-management of the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that from April 1, all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Com on February 19, where two people later died that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated five trillion riyals to deal with the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.
The plan to limit travel between cities was announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Navroz.
As of 16 March 2020, Shia shrines in Kom were open to pilgrims. During February, Iran became the epicentre of virus transmission after China.
Amid claims to hide the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases linked to Iran by February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that day.
The Iranian parliament was shut down on March 3, when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus.
On 12 March, the Human Rights Watch also urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protest and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It said that closed institutions such as quarantine centres are at greater risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was reporting 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there could be five times more cases than reported in Iran.
It has also suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may have affected the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to grow rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was detected. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new judicial-law to contain the outbreak, which quarantined more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas with outbreaks, entry and exit will not be provided."
Orders have already been issued to suspend work activities and sporting events in those areas.” On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths occurred in Italy.
All major sporting events, including the Serie A football matches, were to be held without witnesses until April, but on March 9, all sports were completely postponed for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered to stop almost all business activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) made medical ethics recommendations about protocols for the sorting of can be employed, critical patients.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China in terms of the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft to Italy with medical equipment.
As of April 5, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries.
A CNN report indicated that a combination of Italy's large elderly population and its inability to test people who had the virus by then may have contributed to higher mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most relaxed of the affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British government had not imposed any kind of social distancing or large-scale quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its alleged lack of speed and intensity in response to concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised all non-essential travel and social contact to stop, suggesting people to work from home where possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be shut down as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced measures to create strict social distancing, including restrictions on gatherings of more than two people and prohibiting travel and outdoor activity as essential.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police through imposition of fines and crowd dispersed.
Most businesses were ordered to close except for businesses deemed "essential," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in a person in Washington's Pacific Northwest state who returned from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency, and banned the entry of travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the U.S. government's leading public health institution - announced that they have developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the US made a slow start to the trial, making it difficult to understand the actual extent of the outbreak at the time.
Defective testing kits manufactured by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental testing kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and testing by restrictive criteria (then a doctor's order was required) to qualify for a trial of people by the beginning of March.
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the US.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On 22 March, The Associated Press reported: “Many people who have symptoms and have a physician’s order waited hours or days for a test.” In the US, Governor J. Inslee declared an emergency, an action that was soon followed by other states, after the first death was reported in Washington state on February 29.
Schools in the Seattle area canceled classes on March 3 and by mid-March, schools across the country were being closed. On March 6, 2020, the U.S. was advised by a group of epidemiologists at Imperial College London about projections of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.

On March 25, the governor said that social distancing was working, as the doubling of the case was estimated to slow from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, New York City had 32,308 confirmed cases, and 672 people had died from the virus. On 26 March, the U.S. reported more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy.

The overall choice of Trump's management of the crisis has been split with partisan forms.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized U.S. reliance on imports of critical materials, including essential medical supplies from China.
The air travel template was used to map and forecast the analysis spread and was published in mid-January 2020 in The Journal of Travel Medicine.
Based on 2018 information from the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei had the largest volume of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people traveling from Wuhan.
Bali was ranked the least competent of the 20 most popular destination cities in terms of preparedness, while Australia's cities were considered the most competent. Australia released its emergency response plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
According to it, not much is known about COVID-19, and that Australia will insist on border control and communication in response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, many countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, mainly through chartered flights of the home nation, for which Chinese authorities have granted approval.
Canada, the US, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were the first countries to plan the evacuation of their citizens.

Medical checks were conducted before departure, and four South Africans who were showing symptoms of coronavirus were left behind to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans with negative tests were repatriated.
The test results declared all South Africans without infection, including flight crews, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all under observation as a precaution and quarantined at The Ranch Resort for a period of 14 days.
On March 20, the U.S. began partially withdrawing its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students from U.S. universities came together to help send aid to parts affected by the virus in China, including reportedly a joint group in the Chicago area sent 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on January 30. The humanitarian organization Direct Relief sent 20,000 face masks to Wuhan Union Hospital by emergency flight by January 30, in coordination with FedEx.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to protect "at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia" as well as funding vaccine research and treatment efforts.
The Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, when Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send $2.26 million in aid to China.

After the pandemic hit the country, the cases in China appeared to be stable.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to Italy to help them deal with their coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union.
He later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ventilators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed their concerns over China-made masks and test kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 China-made coronavirus test kits with an accuracy rate of just 30%, meanwhile, the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks that were defective.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks believed to have come from China, but actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in Latin America and parts of Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency aid campaigns for developing countries.
The WHO has appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the pandemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid fear before the Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galia commented that while "the first outbreak of the outbreak that the WHO did not recommend" was a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the "public health" place - and called it "unprecedented in public health history" - 30 January.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the PHEIC was caused by "the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community to contribute $675 million to strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that "have not established systems to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was about to emerge."
Tedros announced in further statements, that “we are only as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more later.” On February 11, the WHO established in a press conference as the name of the COVID-19 disease.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire UN system in response."
As a result, a crisis management team of the United Nations was activated, coordinating the response of the entire UN, which according to the WHO will enable them to “focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to bear the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China, should be able to assist in domestic management and to host meetings with workshops and major national-level institutions to the stage of the pandemic, however, it would be very difficult to say that the WHO was prepared to assess the "severe severity and contagiousness of the disease" and to assess the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural arrangements, to visit the region and to China.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO authorities said that the risk of coronavirus globally would be assessed from “high” to “very high”, which is the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergency program, warned in a statement that “it’s a reality check for every government on earth: It’s time to wake up.”
The virus may be coming your way and you need to be prepared," urging that the right response measures can help the world avoid "its worst form."
Ryan further said that current statistics have not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially acknowledging that every human on earth will come in contact with that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director General said the WHO was "deeply concerned by both the alarming level of spread and severity and the alarming level of inaction." The WHO has faced major criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
The retaliatory measure, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed on respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and it is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minority groups, elderly people, internally displaced people, people living in homeless, extreme poverty, people living in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information as well as perspectives and advice on policy responses in countries around the world.
From policies to strengthening health systems and from the world economy to addressing the effects of travel restrictions and restrictions, the digital hub includes a country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government's handling of the pandemic in the Chinese province of Hubei has been criticised by U.S. Secretary of State for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political body's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected a prior acknowledgement of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration has referred to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying China's "control system has now turned a virus into a global pandemic", which some critics have deemed racist and "deviant from their administration's failure to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government wire, which underlines communications moorings with clear origins in the National Security Council, citing the strategy as "everything is about China."
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances.” Outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s attempt to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of the propaganda to increase global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it has a “geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through rebalancing and the ‘politics of generosity’.”
Borel also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of converting intended aid to other nations to their own country.
And there have been mask-related disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with coronavirus-hit Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "only China responded bilaterally."
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged to send military physicians, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to the Russian army.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper cited an unnamed "high-level political source," saying 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of manipulating "geopolitical and diplomatic".
Lombardy President Att<0xC3><0xAD>lio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia sent medical aid material to the US by a cargo plane.
“While offering assistance to American allies [Putin] believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials will increase production, they will also be able to repay when necessary,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
The largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise will be held at a lower level.
Secretary-General of Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public-health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of soldiers from the United States and many European countries but also the residents of the countries participating in it where they are working.” The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen other current or former political people.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter on 14 March 2020 to world leaders asking for help, stating that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. This outbreak has prompted the U.S. to launch its own universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and other funding similar to high-level financing for public health.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "vague and passive quarantine efforts" when Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at sites designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment, claiming the government’s mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised his response. The pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely, suspending parliament as well as elections and punishing those found to be dealing with the virus and crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, which arose from the use of equipment to fight the outbreak globally, from fear-induced purchases, and disruptions to factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Fear-induced shopping conditions were also seen in many areas, which led to a shortage of grocery items such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from the shelves, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
Due to this demand, the normal price has increased by twenty times and there has been a delay in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, prompting the WHO to warn that it would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for diegu shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity created a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and high demand for food products, both regions are surviving the extreme shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade of important products have been successful, avoiding the extreme shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major decrease in its significant agricultural output, but prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were also seen only temporarily in the city of Wuhan, when Chinese government officials released sugar-meat reserves to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to keep stock for such emergencies.
The global economy in China has been hurt: According to a media report on March 16, the government's measures to prevent the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%, causing a deep injury to the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
Since mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the outbreak of the virus has been thought to pose a major destabilising threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clear image emerges on the potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could be greater than the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis cited the $300<0x2B> billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "struggled" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
Due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak on February 27, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&amp;P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indices fell more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on coronavirus fears, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people believe that there is a possibility of economic slowdown.
Economist Mohammed al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to governments' advice to shut down public places, including Yata Restrictions, travel attractions, and any travel restrictions around the world.
As a result, several airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quants, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was by far the most observed.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The time of this pandemic also coincides with the time of the major travel session, Chunyun, associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events, including annual New Year celebrations, have been cancelled by national and regional governments, with private companies freely closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass celebrations, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs in Beijing.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, with most workplaces instructed not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, with schools closed until March and canceled its New Year celebration. The retail sector has been impacted globally, with store hours reduced or temporarily closed.
Tours of retailers in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
People who walked to shopping centres in March fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, setting up thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and canceling ceremonies. A pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded at home in inland provinces or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could fall to 32%, according to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Several million migrant workers in India have become unemployed (who are paid through daily wages). Angus Reed Institute’s survey found that 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment after the 2020 lockdown.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for a universal loan scheme. About half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on government-funded short-term working plans called Kurzerbet.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has impacted the operations of organizations globally as well as individuals both employed and working independently.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector strive to maintain their (probably publicly funded) mission to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, support artists.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, ceremonies and exhibitions cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Recently another and rapidly growing result of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as concerts and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that the observance of Holy Week in Rome, which takes place during the last week of Lent’s Christian condolence session, has been canceled.
Many bishops have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than attend mass on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With Rome’s Roman Catholic bishopate closing its churches and prayer areas and evacuating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter’s Square, other religious bodies have also cancelled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras and limited public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later the closure of pilgrimages, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled on a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to adopt online methods, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many big theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as creating live streaming or web-based "festivals" of concerts to promote artists' performances, distribution, and their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as a form of humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, growing prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and people with hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries have been noted.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region have seen incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Since February, in information (when most cases were still limited to China), racist sentiments of Chinese people in different groups around the world have been documented.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people in virus-prone areas.
Following the progress of the outbreak in the new hotspot countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience severe outbreaks of COVID-19, may also experience suspicions and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan became popular on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus," which has been considered racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanjhari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, who study in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "so God has avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling it "misleading." In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents were fuelled by the pandemic, which described foreigners as targeted for "foreign garbage" and "suspension".
Many newspapers with paywalls removed him for part or the whole of his coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunization detection (narcotics-science) can be used for both diagnosis and people monitoring.
Immune tests show how many people have had the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to report or who were symptomless.
The results of this investigation can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in people.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in people.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable disparities on how many have been tested in different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly higher in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasal swabs or mucus samples, can be checked.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test done with throat swabs is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people who have been tested in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken by suction catheter from inside the airway or the coughing material can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin in January 2020, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed the test kit by 23 January 2020. The South Korean company KoganBiotech developed a diagnostic class, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kit (Powerchuck coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It discovers the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specifically found in the SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses distributed by the InternationalCraft Control 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). In China, the BGI group was one of the first U.S. companies to receive emergency use approval of the SARS-CoV-2 testing kit from the China's National Medical Products Administration.
Older versions of the test kit found inconclusive results due to faulty reagents in one of three genetic tests, and caused problems in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this caused the average of samples successfully processed throughout February 2020 to be less than 100 samples a day.
The tests using the two components were not considered reliable till 28th February 2020 and till then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. Commercial laboratories in the US began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country till March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; the aggregation and processing of samples should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
The test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare on 11 February 2020. On 12 March 2020 it was reported to have developed a test to detect a COVID-19 infection of the Mayo Clinic. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received permission from the FDA for a high volume of tests to be done within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests to be done in a 24-hour period from a single machine.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to investigate Abbot's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holographic, Labcorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sheffield received an EUA from the FDA for a check that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved an investigation that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day. A testing kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically connects to the novel coronavirus’ nucleocapsid protein (N protein). With the hope that it can give 15 minutes of rapid influenza testing.
A literature review of March 2020 concluded that “early stage chest radiographs have less clinical significance, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features of the CT include bilateral multilober ground-glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric and post-distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effect of the subplural, Crazy Paving and Consolidation develops.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the source point of the current pandemic, has suggested that with many depiction characteristics of CT being similar to other pneumonias and disease processes, despite being less specific, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used as a test or first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis.” As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for a preliminary investigation.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to determine immunity starting in individuals 7 days or around the onset of symptoms and to detect infections for monitoring people. Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples may be used to look for an immune response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
There is no need for the first withdrawal step of testing other than PCR methods. On 26th March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when needed and thus are now able to deliver their immune checks.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitop Diagnostics received European approval for their testing kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and therefore it is much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Immunes can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that any Immune test kits they purchased were not good enough for use.
Hong Kong planned in which suspected patients can stay at home, "Emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube", they will spit in it and get the test results in no time. The British NHS announced that they are launching a plan to test the suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or used the ambulance.
Drive-thru testing centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive checks from any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that the ambulatory setting had the capacity to do around 12,000 tests per day and 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the check is ordered by the physician, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, drive-thru checks were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey observed that by week 12/2020, including week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested in the laboratory tested on February 5,2020. You could have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and tested 33,491 (6.9%) samples in the laboratory. In Israel, the researchers of Technion & Rembaum Hospital found that if combined samples were tested, they could have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
With the construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model has seen that if the ability to check was not started, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory has been promptly followed by Huo-Yen laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in total 12 cities all over China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source frameworks have been released by Origami Assesse which can test up to a maximum of 1122 patients of COVID19 using 93 tests. These balanced frameworks can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
Before March, reagent deficiencies and insufficient amounts became a problem in large-scale checks in the EU, the UK and the US.
This prompted some authors to explore sampling protocols that included warming the samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing higher than any other country for the coronavirus than any other country at the rate of per capita.
This was due to the combination of drive-through testing capability and the purchase of a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency testing labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside of China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany's method of manufacturing kits to self-develop low-income countries that lacked resources.
Germany’s method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control of the United States was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of checks in the U.S. There were problems on the reliability of the test kits between China and the United States at the start of the outbreak and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the testing demands and recommendations by health experts.
In contrast, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capability, especially in private-sector laboratories, was developed by the South Korean government over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing testing programs was the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to the pile-up of thousands of outstanding tests in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of foams and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in its testing kits.
In the United States, check kits developed by the CDC were “low”; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private checks. Spain purchased check kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioegy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm pointed out that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the wrong checking kits and replace them with the second test kits provided by Shenzhen BioEase. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that these should be put in the denub. Atesh Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they "did not use them". The UK which bought 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
After testing, those who tested positive for COVID-19 and those who came in contact with positive SARS-CoV-2 had positive results.
Instead of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working in the town of V<0xC3><0xB2>, Italy, checked twice over the entire population of about 3,400 people at a gap of about ten days.
Nearly half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all the people with detected cases were quarantined.
The travel ban at the place of arrival completely eliminated the new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has grown at a much slower pace than other developed countries in Singapore without aggressive contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantine, but with extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many programs have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but reopened at time on March 23 after school holidays.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by aggressive contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantine, but less aggressive lockdowns.
The statistical study showed that countries with higher testing than the number of deaths have a much lower case fatality rate, possibly because these countries are only more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to test and have limited experience with national laboratories on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the “% of positives in checks” column is influenced by the country’s checking policy.
On the other hand, in a country where only hospitalized people are screened, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens are tested, even if they show symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands for the purpose of removing soil, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at any "necessary moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the faecal-oral tract.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five important moments during the day where it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning or changing the baby’s buttocks, before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food or before and after consumption of raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or diseases.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in cases of delivery at home.
A 2013 study showed that good hand washing practices in children under the age of five can slightly improve their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) as auto-induced behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
About 35 lakh children die annually due to diarrhea and pneumonia.
Making hand washing with soap a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any one vaccine or therapeutic measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by almost half and death from acute respiratory infections by one-fourth, according to UNICEF.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as a symptom of mood disorders (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce transmission from the fecal-oral route of the disease: after using the toilet (urine immersion, feces-resistance), after cleaning the baby’s buttocks (after changing the lung), before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food or before consuming raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when the proper technique of hand washing should be practiced to prevent the transmission of the disease are: before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or sprinkling your nose; after touching the animal waste or handling the animals; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households adopted the hand washing practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that the practice of hand washing had the highest rate of 97% of the time in Saudi Arabia; this rate was moderate in the U.S. at 77%; and this rate was the lowest in China with 23 percent of the available children now increasing the behavior of hand washing with soap at significant times.
The "essential health care program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of mass action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national programme includes brushing teeth daily with fluoride as well as washing hands daily with soap, taking anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It is better to remove microorganisms from the skin by mixing soap or detergent in the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstacles in the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an unskilled skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, there is a sufficient flow of water in the cleaning.
Due to repeated use, solid soaps may contain bacteria left over from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to the bacteria being washed with foam.
However, according to the CDC, "soaps containing liquid soap drops on palms without touching hands are better."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted with emphasis on health conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic-resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are advertised to be.
In addition to the acidic and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulations containing active substances such as beta-blockers (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), microbial anti-active benzolic acid and other skin adjuvant (aloevera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) in the hands can be shown by a University of Oregon School of Public Health.
Comfortable warm water for hand washing is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very rapidly at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a hand hygiene agent with a water-free base.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, glass-coated alcohol water-free hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated with a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel such as a thickening agent, for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol, or a humidifier such as a liquid or foam.
Combining tanu hydrogen-peroxide increases antimicrobial activity further. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers destroy bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinosis, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers containing 70% alcohol destroy 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of applying (like a 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and 1 minute after applying destroy 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria (a 4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are some of the most effective and most effective against bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus (or norwalk) type of virus that is the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal inflammation. Sufficient hand disinfectant or alcohol rubber should be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
The pores of the front and back of both hands and in the middle and all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Fingernails should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them in both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubbers, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick disinfection activity towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricant and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by combining glycerin and/or other lubricants into the formula.
In clinical trials, lubricant-containing alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antimicrobial repellent.
Rarely allergic to additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs are contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity.
The low tendency to induce disturbing contact dermatitis compared to hand washing with soap and water became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, agents without water do not clean organic substances from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
That's why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol rubbers.
Recently, in contrast to alcohol, which has been shown to reduce efficacy after repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activation after applying formulations that use Benzalkonium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it can increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.
The WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of the transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because basins with stable water can be contaminated, although the temperature of the water does not matter.
Make foam by rubbing the appropriate amount of soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Rinse for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are released by rubbing for longer periods.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can be contaminated again.
Dry with a clean towel or allow to dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands become more easily re-contaminated. The most commonly missed areas are the area between the thumb, wrist, fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nail and chippy nail polish can shelter microbes.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to protect hands from being dry; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap is not available, a variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing, if needed, for example by pouring water from a hanging martban or lauki with suitable holes and/or using ash. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions are available.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique in which a leg-operated lever, which is used to pour a small amount of water on the hands and the tika of soap, is hung by a rope.
Drying hands effectively is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A large amount of research suggests that paper towels provide more hygiene than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, which was sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
The total number of bacteria after hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer increased by 194% on average on the mattresses of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with a jet-air dryer resulted in an increase of 42% on average finger mattresses and 15% on palms in the total number of bacteria.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by 76% on average on the mattresses of the fingers and 77% on the palms. Scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method had the potential to cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which extracts air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow micro-organisms out of the hands and unit and potentially contaminate the environment of other toilet users and toilets up to 2 meters away.
With the use of hot air hand dryers, micro-organisms spread from dryers up to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying the hands:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with drying from paper towels.
Washing hands using hand sanitizer wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water during the journey.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in the prevention of disease in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when they forget.
In one study, their use has shown a decrease in infection rates.
The hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water or proper amount of gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed with each other.
If there is garbage under the nails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
This protects the hands from being contaminated again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (the " germs") and prevent them from transmitting.
According to a report in The New England Journal of Medicine, hand washing in most medical environments remains at unacceptable levels, with a large number of physicians and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood transfusions by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-stuffing in health care areas.
Document guidance of hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Vitby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if performance of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has set out “five opportunities” for hand washing:
After coming into contact with blood/body fluids
Before the disinfection work, and
After the care of the patient. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap (“medicinal” or “antimicrobial” soap) provides the hand-washing agent with an ability to kill.
Before surgery or in a system in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly widespread, such a lethal ability may be desired. For surgical irritants to ‘crush’ your hands down, having a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfecting the hands after washing.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing of the wrists up to the arm and elbow for 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of a sick person or use a hand disinfectant.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased by more than 35%, there was little additional benefit.
By hand washing with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease is more than triple compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Alcohol-based rubbing leads to 26% less bacterial rubbing of hands with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 minutes when compared to hand washing with antibacterial soap, it was revealed that the hand rubbing with alcohol causes bacterial infection.
But hands-on H1N1 influenza A viruses and clostridium difficile are more effective than soap and water alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care systems can include education on hand washing employees, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and verbal and written instruction to employees.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economical, necessary means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal hand washing behavior from lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people’s homes, in schools and at the workplace is a challenge.
For example, in most rural Africa every private or public toilet has very few hand-washing taps, even though there are cheap options to build a hand washing station.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to habits put in place rather than being due to a lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and support of hand washing from soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while campaigns for social promotion are less effective. An example for the promotion of hand washing in schools is the “three-star method” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars, respectively.
Making hand washing stations can be a part of campaigns to promote hand washing that are done to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to try to bring about a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji of hand washing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to prevention of DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially those with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or in wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified in the mid-19th century by two promoters of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the Englishman who is the founder of "modern nursing".
At that time most people believed that infections were caused by a foul smell called myasmus.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "the right techniques of hand washing" were hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and in airports toilets in Germany.
The phrase “washing one’s hands” means declaring one’s unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to accept complicity in it.
It derives from the biblical Matthew chapter where Pontius Pilate distinguished himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up a fictitious stain, reflecting her criminal conscience about the crimes she has committed and her husband's motivation to commit the crime.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or meditating immoral acts, and attach more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" complementary tasks such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soap water without washing hands is a part of many religions including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, Tevilla in Judaism and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wazu in Islam. The ritual described in religion is also a part of hand washing. Religion specifically provides hand washing after some actions.
It is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Controlling the Risks of Spreading COVID-19 Infections at the Workplace
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), occupational safety and health practices are applications for the control of threats.
Proper control of the risk of disease spreading at the workplace depends on the work being done, the work being done, the risk assessment of the sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are more at risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk tasks have minimal professional contact with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and disinfecting the work environment regularly.
Medium contact risk tasks are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, control measures for threats to this group include: ventilation from high-efficiency air filters, using sneak guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for that situation if the person infected with COVID-19 is encountered.
OSHA considers health workers and morgue workers at high contact risk to be exposed to a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases to a higher contact risk if the personnel perform procedures that produce aerosols on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, or collect or handle samples from them.
Controls of hazards suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have a number of effects within the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of possible contact.
What goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as at the time of low demand or shopping through delivery or moving services), can both change the nature of the trade.
Finally, movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparation and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address risk levels associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community systems, and risk factors for individual personnel such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address the risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in a community with a place of business affects the responses that are adopted.
The sequence of controls of hazards is a structure that is widely used to form a set of controls of hazards according to the effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include separating employees from work-related hazards without depending on the employee's behavior, and this may be the most economical solution in implementing them.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
Personnel should be selected for all types of PPE depending on the threat, properly fitted (e.g., respirator), constantly and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and changed as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk tasks have minimal professional contact with people and other coworkers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and well-washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, providing routine respiratory etiquettes covering cough and sneeze, tissue and waste characterization of cleaning equipment, preparing remote or parallel shifts and use of tools to personnel and others if necessary.
Immediate identification and segregation of potential infectious individuals at the workplace is an important step to protect personnel, customers, visitors, and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute osteoarthritis stay at home for at least 24 hours without fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms without fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that the sick leave policies in place are flexible to allow employees to stay home care for sick family members.
Medium contact risk tasks, according to OSHA, include tasks that require frequent or close contact with people within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission going around the business space, or because the person has recently undergone extensive COVID-19 location international transmission.
These include personnel who have direct contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environment, and personnel who have the necessary equipment to carry out safety measures, personnel to carry out safety measures, personnel to carry out safety-related operations, and personnel to carry out safety-related operations, and some high-volume sales arrangements. This includes personnel to carry out safety-related activities, such as the use of personnel, and the use of equipment, such as the use of personnel, and use of equipment, and the equipment.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person from others by 6 feet, nominating a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or telling the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear usable medical gloves when caring for the sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and should potentially wear additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other usable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, travel in the controls of hazards are suspended and self-isolation and immediately notify the medical center if the person on board or other signs of a fever are present during the ship’s development.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the isolation person’s room. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfecting if an infected person has been in a school building, rather than community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field visits, cancellation of meals at meetings and other large gatherings such as physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing distance between desks, adjusting arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is adequate transmission in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel performing daily law activities, the immediate health risk is considered as follows by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected individuals with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during catch, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment before reusing, using household cleaning sprays or wipes, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for the prevention and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care and mortuary personnel to be in high or very high categories of contact risk.
High contact risk tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if personnel perform aerosol-generating procedures on known or suspected patients of COVID-19, collecting or handling samples from them.
The processes that cause aerosols include duct penetration, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or collecting samples from rip-offs.
High-contact mortuary tasks include people who prepare the body of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high-contact risk if they conduct autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups, including during the carrying out of aerosol-generating procedures, include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
Specific negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and dead-house arrangements.
Samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in different waiting areas. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who undergo procedures that cause SARS-CoV-2 to operate within 6 feet of known or suspected patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who work airborne.
In the U.S., N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better approved by NIOSH should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, chonga and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, through physical barriers such as transparent windows, allows only people involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only PPE masks required for specific work, using the same respirator without removing the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, inspecting and coordinating PPE supply chain personnel.

Remittance Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
This month there are extraordinary circumstances all around us.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear the interconnectedness of all human beings in the world and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community building at the heart of this organization.
The kind of amity we have seen among all our colleagues on emails, calls and chats proves extraordinary how many extraordinary human beings we have had the privilege of working with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as my co-workers that I cannot express in words.
Last week, one of my colleagues shared his work with me.
He reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is for this very important resource to remain available online and for all.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or the source of our colleagues’ salaries or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it needs it the most.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work with you this coming week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robin pointed out earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our methodology and prepare a timetable for the days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response we had to our thinking on the situation before us, and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to ease the tension and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not taking your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don’t have to say it, but we are saying it.
No illness leave or PTO is required – just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and timetable to ensure that the core areas of work are not overlooked.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you and ensure that appropriate attention is given to your situation.)
The hourly wage workers will be paid in full.
We have already said, and we are once again reaffirming our commitment to deliver on our promises to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will get salary based on his normal working hours during normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick and cannot work, you will still get a salary.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to give way to the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely gratifying, especially at such a time.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
We say that you talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can make adjustments accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things we can't stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Grants accumulation teams (and others) perform extremely important tasks that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments, to assess existing objectives and to focus our attention on collaborating on things that are essential to our mission
We all have a lot to do, we’ll all just focus on the most essential projects.
By reducing the speed now, we will be able to avoid injury later.
We don't have any plans to "doubling time for replenishment" after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be required to work extra hours to meet deadlines beyond reality.
We believe that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What will happen to the Annual Plan (APP)?
In order to adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we would like to revise our 2020-2021 annual plan to meet deadlines.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their over-critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of time-frame will bring a good reduction in our current planning workload and pressure across the organization.
We will put our proposal before the board of directors next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will inform the representatives and the teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, contact, and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we deployed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
She infects every surface, lobby, and elevator bank that comes to our floor from the hospital-grade anti-viral solution.
The building is implementing its own maintenance-duty protocol using products that assist in the safety of its residents.
We are confident that when we return, the office will be fully ready.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week, our DC office adopted a completely remote system in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also a discussion of leasing a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home/away for the first time.
Our colleagues working from home/away from work for a long time will know that this requires adjustments, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to a maximum of one or two hour increments.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
Define meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send the reading material in advance.
Make videos your default option with the help of tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and collaboration.
Take the initiative to facilitate every meeting, one person to monitor the chat for questions and keep an account of the speaker list, and one person to help take notes (or take notes in collaboration)
Send an email to Tech Support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health insurance to cover expenses.
Connect to the <0x23>remoteies channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is examining webinar-based labor efficiency guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as the Editathon, until the WHO announces the end of the global pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be penalized for being delayed or constrained to amend those goals.
This coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and topical community conferences.
The disruption has caused a sense of sadness in the entire global community, but also a sense of relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia, and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on MetWiki with the aim of monitoring the impact and providing a space for the community to follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch about COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are there to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information, from this email on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, programs, a major work area, or coverage challenge, or need help with anything else, please feel free to inform and work with the CRT.
We are available to help provide assistance and establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abdication of our functions and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our actions and obligations are likely to need to be adapted in a way that we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the support they need, and continue to provide the service the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
At the moment, it is time to help each other, and create space for the important work to come in the coming weeks and potentially in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Linnet L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point in cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptides M2 domain and the C-terminal calculus renal amino acid conductive domain.
ACE2 is a one-time crossover type I membrane protein with an enzymeically active domain unrevealed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the parietal domain by another enzyme called shedase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membranes of lung type II aerosol cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, intracellular cells of the artery and vein, and in most organs of the arterial soft muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in cerebrospinal vulva, striatum, hypothalamus and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the genius of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I dissociates the hormone into the ventricular angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and makes it hydrolysate angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ir-Phe).
ACE2 [des-Arg9]- can also decompose many other peptides, including bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the indifferent amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and its role has been reported in Hartnup disease.
As a parasite protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-Generating Virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Generating Virus).
More specifically, joining the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2's spore S1 protein leads to the transfer of both viruses and enzymes to endocytosis and the endosomes located within the cells.
This admission process also requires the nutrient Serine Protease TMPRSS2 to inflame the S protein, whose inhibition is under current scrutiny as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “use of ACE inhibitors compared to controls was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34%.”
Also, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in people with trauma and heart failure."
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered new therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour process (period) of effect.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulatory angiotensin II increases. Acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated aspirated in clinical trials for the treatment of rhACE2.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing, i.e. the process of identifying individuals (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for building contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
The less intuitive option involves the use of a Bluetooth signal to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems to support such Bluetooth-based apps.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in combination with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app “StopKorona!” to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. Similar apps ("StopCovid") have also been employed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, which is designed to ensure they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if the app's use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited only to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations, determining which types of organizations may include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after this threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement for limitations on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:
The monitoring must be "legitimate, necessary and proportionate";
There should be a comprehensive section for the extension of supervision and monitoring;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided to promote discrimination and de-authorization;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens towards abuse and to respond to abuse;
"Relevant participation" will be required by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and authorityless groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohan Grenagen) (RSF) have also released the checklist.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to address the problem of constant monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined space data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interoperability (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to trace contacts in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Several countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, these details were not released yet.
Privacy-protection contact tracing with a large body of research literature since at least 2013 is a well-established concept. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user’s proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that involves both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protection closeness tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and other contact tracing mechanisms.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting and using location or path-breaking data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the white paper "Apps Gon Rog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was originally set up at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that were essentially organized in the context of the same approach and large-scale similar protocols, aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving comprehensive adaptation.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has opened-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, companies that control Google and Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would preserve privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protective cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three steps:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protection coronavirus tracing apps
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android
Drug repurposing (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-appointment or therapeutic change), for which it was originally developed, is the re-purpose of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directives include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the plasma transfusion related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of those binding sites provides a proper project to develop effective antiviral drug to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papen-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain and others studied a number of candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed for their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2 anti-malarial drug in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of New York State's Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA's process of clinical trials and is only authorized under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show Favipiravir to be "clearly effective."
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipiravir and half received omefenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of a combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir (caltra), concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to block HIV from being replicated by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the proteases of SARS-CoV-2. There have been criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources for the repurposement of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had several filo-, pneumo-, paramexo- and artificial ambient antiviral activity to protect against coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two tests conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
The state of New York began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), is planning a clinical trial for an endocrine corticosteroid for asthma, Tigens alvesco (cyclosodine), for the treatment of patients with pre-existing symptoms of the novel coronavirus.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients admitted to critical, hospitalized cases to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecule heparin is being widely used to treat patients, which is why the Italian drug agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of anoxaperine sodium on prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the repurposement of approved anti-viral drugs, which were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umiphenovir: Umiphenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments are:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Testing also in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a planned vaccine to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to be available in less than 18 months to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak spread around the world, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
The imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the start of 2020 to create an effective vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
Advanced major platform goals in Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been declared, but less public information is available (planned or envisaged in planning).
While initial safety and immunogenicity tests are performed in a Phase I-II trial, it is usually done at random, placebo-controlled, and multiple sites while determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring adverse effects on the optimal dose, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is examining the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which will genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center at the University of Saskatchewan (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine aiming to start human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, the Yansen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Haneke Shutemaker, announced that it has begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Voxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Voxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that he had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and was starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, Nugenerex immuno-oncology, a generics subsidiary, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a lye-key peptide vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Western Maryland both announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that it was in the development and manufacture of the vaccine.
Novavax will work with Inc.
The partners announced plans for preclinical testing and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 developers, and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on an early track.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which has a human trial plan for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Curvac "large sums of money for special access to the COVID-19 vaccine," which the German government opposed.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical testing, whose clinical trial is expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Taquis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that they would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and could start testing on their final vaccine candidate until the fall.
On March 19, 2020, in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million into the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, including the Institute of the West, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes the total investment of CEPI in COVID-19 vaccine development US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Cura<0xC3><0xA7>ao, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-proclaimed RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used when there is another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of PittCoVac, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that “the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines provided by the MNA had induced antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that began to clear 2 weeks after vaccination.”
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the design of the DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophage, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities accumulated resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have the additional benefits of the disease they prevent.
Another randomised trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research assessing the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for bio-safety level 3 containment measures to combat living viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested to protect against SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine to protect against MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was assumed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vaccinated vaccines, two are adenoviral-vaccine (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-MERS-Vac.
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was aware of and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases the symptoms are mild, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, often through small drops generated by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets arise when breathing out, they usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a dirty surface and subsequently touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the phlegm of a nasopharynx.
It is recommended to use masks for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of all the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, twitching, difficulty waking up and blue of the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, only chest tightness and rapid heartbeat were initially observed.
In some cases, the disease can grow to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Information shows that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, initial evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained undiagnosed during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of the 166 infections that day were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
There can be a large amount of viral in both mucus and saliva.
Talking in a high voice leads to more drops than talking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that drops that go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) from a cough without a cover can be generated.
Although the virus is not airborne in general, the National Academy of Science has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and cardiovascular pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretion to become aerosol and thus airborne spread.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through feces, this risk is considered low. This virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although transmission is possible before symptoms emerge, its risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. The virus lives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper.
Even then, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and dehumidifiers are also effective if used correctly; soap products neutralize these by dissolving the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalisation began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral volume, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral volume on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks down its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the viruses reach the nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in lung type II aerosol cells.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to somatic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly manifested in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor disease diagnosis. Dielectrical aerosol damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inhaling substances within the lungs have been found.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a mutation for ACE2-promoting epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of somatic hypertrophy.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-solvent T-cells were shown to be correlated with the selection of inflammatory IL-6-solvent monoocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
The lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or mucus sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples to be taken in a two-week interval and the results are immediately worth less.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first care-at-home trial for use later that month on March 21, 2020. The clinical guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, outlined ways to detect infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multipolar ground-glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetric and lateral distribution in the initial infection is normal.
When the disease progresses, subplural dominoes, crazies peeing (thickening of the palate walls with variable aerosol fillers), and densification may appear.
Few statistics are available about the microscopic lesions and disease body action of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: adhesions, pericarditis, lung solidification and pulmonary adhesions in the pleural cover
Four types of the severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hypertrophy, large amorphous pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic interstitution and multicentric giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Radiant aerosol damage (DAD) with irradiated aerosol leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe short-oxidation.
Treatment of pneumonia: management of leakages and pulmonary interstitial fibrillation in the ventral cavity
Blood: circulating interstitial clotting (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent and washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommending using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings with cloth in public settings to limit transmission by partially asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with infected individuals with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also include that people should stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no known drug to be effective at preventing COVID-19. As the vaccine is not expected to be available until at least 2021, a key part of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "reducing the cycle."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
Additionally, it recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. Areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the anti-microbial action arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand inhibition."
Glycerol is mixed as a humidifier.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include providing support to fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Helpful treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when aerosol-producing processes such as duct penetration or hand ventilation are performed.
For health workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions to keep the person in an airborne infection isolation cell (AIIR). The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE chonga, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and therapeutic gloves. When available, priority is given to respirators (instead of face masks).
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness toward a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
The CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other options, but only in a few percent of cases.
The type of respiratory aid for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for those hospitalized, with some evidence that high flow nasal inlet or duct inlet with bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether one of these two provides the same benefits to severely ill people is not known.
Some physicians prefer to use enteric mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the proliferation of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal entryways. Severe cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases that necessitate hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have finally been admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as Acute Respiratory Crisis Syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control systems and ventilators capable of high PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen distribution while minimizing lung damage associated with the ventilator and the risk of pneumothorax.
High PEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may develop by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
An attempt may be made to give antiviral medication in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily allowed health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is at serious or immediate risk.
There have been no necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting 'close contact' using surveillance data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If possible exposure is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracing and artificial intelligence are used to trace infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who have come into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for preventing the spread of the virus and research.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect those who violated the quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Julio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40 percent of people are in some way moving".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of self-inflicted infection.
“Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn is an ideal storm damaging people’s mental health and well-being,” the BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying.
Other common upper respiratory tract diseases such as common colds may have a mild process with or without certain symptoms.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while cases with severe or severe diseases may take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on statistics from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at high risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a lack of statistics for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal spasms and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Sclerosis abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same information, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalisation.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death among patients transferred to the ICU was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average time from exhibiting early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate in men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate in women was 1.7%.
The tissue pathology tests of the lung samples of the autopsy show irradiated aerosol damage in both lungs with cytoplasmic fibromixoid leakages.
Pneumocytosis had seen viral cell pathological changes.
The lung picture appeared to be similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or heart rate stopping.
According to U.S. March statistics, 89% of people hospitalized had preexisting conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to those regional differences and also due to system related difficulties.
The mortality rate can be overestimated due to low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that the death is a result of prior cases may mean that the present mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term postoperative symptoms of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause intensive care post-concussion syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as potential depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for coronavirus have been reported at a later date after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse of a recovered infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be of an animal origin that spreads from natural and from animal to human through infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely caused by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was reported as 1 December 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time of the initial outbreak, and characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO prescribed emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by laboratory and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 without clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 confirmed number of deaths from COVID-19. The disease code U07.2 for confirmed cases diagnosed with COVID-19. The death-case ratio made within a certain time interval
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global death-to-case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include case mortality (CFR), which represents the percentage of individuals diagnosed with a disease dying, and the infection mortality (IFR) that represents the percentage (specified and undiagnosed) of infected individuals dying from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of the immune system can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Aida, in a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not crumbling.
In the Netherlands, blood donors can be immune in about 3%, as assessed.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality varies for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have a higher mortality rate in men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only lower at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, low prevalence of smoking in women and developing co-morbid conditions in men such that high blood pressure at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified, i.e. 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), species of animals or a group of people that are in line with international recommendations for nomenclature aimed at preventing offending. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO additionally uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as interim names for acute respiratory disease viruses and disease, which comply with the 2015 guidelines of not using places in disease and virus names.
The formal names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as nasca fah and parts of ventilators.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to provide the required time-frame, a local startup printed the required 100 valves overnight by reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no drug or vaccine approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hopes of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available at this time, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First, the researchers aim to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a quick immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
Another strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to some of the virus' subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-Connection protein that helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptors.
A third strategy is the creation of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique of vaccine making).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. The antibody-dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir scheduled to be reported by the end of April, most Chinese research is working on repurposed antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was underway. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta combined with lopinavir/retinoin.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence is available for the efficacy of Remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with unapproved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, calls have been made for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice as much dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The guidelines for the Chinese 7th edition also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the suppression of artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further studies in organisms after showing low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that priming the initial kinetic protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), interstitial with ACE2 receptors, is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Osaltamivir does not contract artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing the amount of cytokine in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent cytokine levels from increasing. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a short study was completed.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non-randomized trial nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify the amount of cytokine increases, it aims to cope with such increases, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptors were approved by the FDA in 2017, for a different reason, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of car T cell therapy-induced steroid refractory cytokine immunity syndrome.
To date there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinated method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral indifference is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other procedures, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of healthy beneficial serum, which contains the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and is specific to this virus, can be increased for faster planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, who contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
