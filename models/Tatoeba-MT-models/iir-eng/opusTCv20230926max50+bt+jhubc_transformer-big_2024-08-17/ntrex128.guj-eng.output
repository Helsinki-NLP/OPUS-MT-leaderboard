Whales AM worried about 'muppet-like look'
Some AMs are upset about the suggestion to change their title as a member of the MWPS (Whales Parliament).
It was created because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The entire political spectrum of AM was concerned that it could lead to ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned about the "matching of TWP and PWP2."
The following is a summary of the article: "Wheels T.B.P. is a fool and a P.W.P."
Plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested options.
Whales' conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but it noted Muppets from MPWP being short-spoken jumpers.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to that of the Yorkshire English letter U.
The committee, which has prepared a law for the change of name, said: "The final decision of any description regarding what will be said to the members of the Legislative Assembly will certainly be the members' own."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the legislature of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which identified the Assembly as having wide support to be known as the Welsh Parliament.
In the matter of the title of AM, the Commission favoured Wales Parliamentarians or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
AM appears to be suggesting alternative options, but depositing the raw draft of the law relating to changes within a week from the authorized officer who is expected to obtain a consensus for Ellen Jones can be a headache.
The manner in which the legislature functions in the law relating to the amendment would include rules relating to disqualification of AM and other changes relating to it including the design of the committee system.
When the AM will discuss the law, they will get a final vote on the question of where they should be identified.
The people of Macedonia will vote for a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
A popular vote was set up with neighboring Greece, which has a region known as Macedonia, to redress decades-old separatism.
Ethan had long been adamant that his northern neighbor's name represented a claim to his territory and repeatedly opposed his bid for membership for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gj<0xC3><0xB6>rg Ivenova, who is opposed to the name change, said he would not take the referendum to heart.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Chief Minister Zoran Zev, argued that the change of name was only the price paid to join the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's bells became silent as churches in Harlem were in trouble.
"Historically, the elders I spoke to said there were bars and churches in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's no coffee today."
He said that it is understandable to see the 12 being invisible.
"Today, people are socialized differently," he said.
"Now there won't be twelve long next to dwelling houses where people go regularly."
Because for the churches he was so concerned that the money he received from property sales would not last as long as the leaders wanted, "and sooner or later they would get back to where they started."
He added that condominium apartment buildings filled with people who don't help the rest of the neighborhood's holy places could take the place of churches.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore the day is not far when these churches will be completely closed because most people who come to these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became Black Metropolis - decades after the Metropolitan Community, St. Martin, in the year 1870.
The original white Methodist congregations were moving in 1930.
Black congregations praying nearby took possession of the building.
The main street to be purchased in Harlem was occupied by black congregations led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who objected to keeping or encouraging black people.
The front of the building was heavily damaged in 1939, but as Father Johnson's priests planned to rebuild work, they began to bellow.
Father Johnson's father, Rev. David Johnson, and St. Martin's Successors proudly identified the bell as "the bell of the poor."
Experts who bellowed in July called it something else: "cultural treasures" and "unchangeable historical tools."
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first incident in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysosio A Lind, who moved to a large Carillon in a riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mervedher said that St. Martin did not take his place.
What had been happening with St. Martin for the past few months was the story of a complex sculpture and contractors, some brought by the raw leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
PARIS - The governing body of the parish, made up of raw leaders, wrote to the West in July to express concern that the Diocese "would not be involved in keeping the sculptures and contractors sent by the Western Diocese even though they wanted to pass the cost."
Some have complained about the lack of transparency from the Diocese.
Shark injured a 13-year-old man in a lobster dive in California.
A 13-year-old boy in California on the first day of the opening of the karachi season when he was diving for the karachila on Saturday was attacked and injured by sharks, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Becons Beach in Ansinatus.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a scream for the boy's help, and then, with the group to help him pull him out of the water, he hit the pedal towards it.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching crabs, but then he realized "he was screaming, I understood a little!"
I understood a little bit.
"All her laughter was opened," said Hamel, who paid attention to her when she found the boy.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” Hemel added.
The boy was airlifted to Redi Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was kept in a critical condition.
The people responsible for the attack were unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles told the media that sharks were found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that they did not belong to the dangerous species of sharks.
Gilles added that the victim sustained serious injuries in the upper part of the frame.
Authorities closed the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami in Isinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area but most were not considered dangerous.
Sansburi's plans have pushed the UK's beauty market
Sensbury Boots, SuperDrugs and Debenhams are being kept in the department store with style beauty expert assistant staff.
Big beauty materials will be tested in 11 stores across the country as a sustainable push to the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market that is starting to grow as fashion and homeware sales continue to decline and, if successful, will be taken to more stores.
Investing in beauty is used as a way to use the space of illusions held for TVs, microwaves, and homewares.
Sensbury said it would double the size of the beauty materials it offers to 3,000 items, including Revlon, Essai, Tweezerman and Dr. Pavlova for the first time.
Lorial's current ranges of mabiline and brits bees will also have more space in branded areas, like those found in boutiques.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most items are tight-knit-friendly - which is growing in demand among small shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer in two Sanbury stores will experiment with discounts on fragrance shops, the first of which is opened last week in Croydon, South London, while the second is due to open later this year in Celly Oak, Birmingham.
Buying online and buying small amounts of daily food from local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do a lot to get people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sansbury, said shops would look to be growing like a department store as the supermarket chain tries to give back more services and non-food fights to the discounted Eldi and Lidi.
Senbaris has been keeping Argos shops in thousands of stores and launching a number of settlements since bringing the two chains together two years ago, which is said to have supported the sale of groceries and made the acquisitions more profitable.
An earlier attempt by supermarkets to improve their beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sansbury tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the alliance ended on how to get a share of the revenue from the chemist's store in their supermarkets.
Three years ago, when Sansbury sold its 281 store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy chain's Malique Celcio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, new strategies emerged.
Lloyds will play a role in the planning by increasing the luxury range of their skincare brands, including La Roche-Poce and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sansbury, said: "We've improved the look and feel of our beauty materials to enhance our customers' environments.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be helpful in providing advice.
Our brand's range is determined to meet all needs and a pleasant atmosphere and favorable destinations, that is, we now have a niche for beauty materials that challenge the old style of shopping."
Peter Jones 'shooed out' after Holly Willoughby pulled out a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
When TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, the Dragons Den star Peter Jones was found guilty of doing his life-style brand business with Mark and Spencer and ITV
Vilaughabai doesn't really have time for her own homewares and accessories brands.
The business of the piers was combined with the Gauneeth Pelthros Group brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce she was leaving.
At the last minute, Holly Willoughby took back the lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her new big contract with Marks and Spencer, and ITV, putting the dragoons' Dan Starr Peter Jones in trouble.
Sources say that when the Golden Girl on TV admitted in a tense meeting on Tuesday that she had made new deals worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meaning she didn't really have time for their homeware and accessories brands, Jones was "gorgeous."
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Group brand and more than doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Since Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce she was really leaving, Jones left the UK to go on one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "So far, it's really been Holly's highest priority.
It was going to be her long-term future in which she could see herself for a few decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe how close it was to the start of what was happening on Tuesday.
Marlowe was full of front-loaded warehouses ready for sale at the headquarters.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter will take place this morning, one of Britain's most trusted stars, due to heavy disruptions in the range of items ranging from cashiers and minbati to clothing and homewares, which could cause the firm to lose millions of dollars.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin Jones and his wife Tara had been close to Cap for ten years.
Willoughby actually set up the setup in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Flirting with certain holidays and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Beldwin TV production firm.
Willoughby became the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McParty as host of IM Celebrity of ITV.
A source close to Jones said: "We didn't comment on his business matters last night."
We've been through some tough times and we've fallen in love."
He joked about how the news media would react to his comments, some calling it "unanticipated" and for being so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump do such a thing?
Trump said in his speech that he was a "fake news reporter."
"I haven't done anything wrong."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump set up a preliminary meeting in Singapore in June, a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations to free the nuclear reactor broke down.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat RI Young Ho told global leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not seeing a "relevant response" from the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament measures.
Instead, it noted, the U.S. continues to issue targeted sanctions to keep the pressure off.
During his speech, Trump showed a lot of optimism.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were heading for war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now, we have this wonderful relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded good results - rocket tests were stopped, hostages were helped to be freed, and the rest of the U.S. troops returned home.
And he defended the unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to get the presidency, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get in from this closed battlefield, we have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing thousands of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told not to need it.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been temporarily displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a pre-requisite for seeking international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they weren't seeking international help, therefore, it was a little challenging," Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is trying to move to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing Palu's situation to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the way Indonesia's land is continuously doing business, this country is sadly unprepared for the fury of nature.
This view is not commonly seen on the coast when tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh.
Although the warning is in effect, there are apparently chances of losing life due to the lack of sirens warning of a tsunami in Palu.
At best, it's challenging to travel to many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make the systems more complex.
The hospital ship is in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the major issue of improving Indonesia's existing infrastructure in his election campaign, and he used a lot of money in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds left Mr. Joko's administration worried as he was set to face re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure due to increasing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced more conservative types of sects.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes as Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other deadly weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge plays deep-dipped bourbon v. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London to save Liverpool from a loss against Chelsea in the Premier League.
While his team was behind Chelsea 1-0, Sturridge got a pass 30 yards out of Kserdan Shaqiri.
He grabbed the ball from his left before hitting the shot towards the far post.
The attempt went off the top of the box as it hit the upper corner of the right side of the net.
At the end of the day, the cat sat in the back of the van and fell to the ground.
"It was just an attempt to get into that position, to reach the ball and a player like the credit always plays as forward as possible, so, I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolIFC.COM.
"I saw Kante coming in and touching one and couldn't think of anything more and just shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead of Belgian star Eden Hazard at half time after scoring in the 25th minute.
The Blue Striker stopped spinning in the middle of the field and the Metau Kovesic<0xC3><0xAD>n re-passed the game before rushing into Liverpool's half.
Kovalchuk quickly moved into the middle of the field.
Then he threw the beautiful throw ball, which led Hazard to the box.
Hazard got out of the save and ended up in the net of the far post through a left foot shot and ahead of Allison Baker of Liverpool.
At Studio Na Paulo in Naples, Italy, at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Liverpool clashed with Napoli in the group stages of the Champions League.
UEFA will face Chelsea in Europe at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and a 20-feet high wave caused many people to be trapped in the streets of buildings brought down, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after the woman died
The woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning after an investigation into the murder was launched.
At 7.55 a.m. on John Street in Grayson Moose, a 44-year-old man met with a suffocating wound, from which he was arrested on suspicion of murdering a 32-year-old man.
Police were called in to help those who saw or heard anything in the area.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: The investigation is in its early stages but I request anyone who is in or near the Johnson Street area in Birkenhead to contact us.
I would also like to request anyone to contact us, especially taxi drivers whose dashcam footage may have caught anything because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found inside the property, which is a local of Birkenhead.
The next morning, a friend of mine came to the house to ask her where she was.
The investigation is underway as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, was still trying to return to his flat, but he was told by police that no one was allowed inside or out of the building.
When he realized what had happened, he couldn't say anything.
Residents have been told that they will have to wait for hours before being allowed to enter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now seen as a crime scene.
There was a woman with an eye on the ground.
She kept saying, She is very hateful
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the besieged area with a van parked outside.
A number of officers were standing inside the compound and observing the block of flats.
Any person with information was asked to contact the DM<0x40>MeerPollCC by calling 101 or hiding the names of the accused Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 by referring to the log 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell Parliament statue has become a famous state-of-the-art memorial due to its rewriting of history.
His exile will be a poetic justice for the dhimmitude of many of England's cultural and religious works, such as the training made by his religiously pious followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate about the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell, which is located outside Westminster Palace, could not be avoided.
The Iconoclasm of the English Civil War also did not command or even pulled by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong chromewall would have been sacrificed in the previous century for the actions of his ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hemo Thorncroft's wonderful representation of Cromwell is a proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of the personality that many people still consider important to celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Telegraph: "Chromewell was remembered as a protector of Parliament against many external pressures, perhaps even more so at the end of the 19th century than today, in his case certainly monarchy.
Whether or not it is an accurate representation is a matter of continuing historical debates.
It is certain that the schism of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a remarkable personality who represented one side of that part.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese farmer was killed by the Chinese.
According to local media reports, a farmer was brutally attacked and killed in a market in southwest China.
Only the man identified by his surname "Yaun" was found near Stye after a report on Sunday morning in a blood-stained condition at the Liupanshui market in southern China's Guizhou area.
On May 30, 2005, a grizzly farmer on a hogri in the Xinjiang of Qinghai area of China was preparing to give an injection of the grizzly vaccination.
According to the report, he had come from the Yunnan area along with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 brooms in the market.
The next morning, his cousin saw him dead, and found the door of the neighbor's haunted house open.
He said that the big mistake in Stie was with his mouth blood.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin's feet were bloody and tingling", his cousin referred to him as having his surname "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed the young man entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his fleas.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed him was not his son or daughter.
When the police gathered evidence from the spot, the market manager told the evening news that the broom was locked to prevent anyone from attacking.
Young's family and market authorities were found to be negotiating compensation for the death.
Despite the exception, there have been cases of attacks on evil men reported earlier.
In 2016, a miscreant in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in which the man sustained serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound broom filled the whales' farmer into his tractor until his wife moved away in fear of the monster.
After eating an Oregon farmer by his broom in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that usually brooms are not aggressive but the taste of blood can "inflame" him.
"They're just in the game.
They're nippers, very curious... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to respect them in the right way," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern U.S.
According to the forecast, like the cold water of the mexico, the hurricane rosa passes through it as it weakens.
However, in the coming days, Rosa flooding will bring rain to the entire North Mexico and south-west U.S.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph at 5 a.m., a series of 1 hurricanes. On Sunday as of Eastern Time, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected to move northwards on Monday.
By then, the Pacific Ocean has begun to take a pit shape and move east toward the west coast of the U.S. Rosa Baja will begin to push deep tropical humidity north into the south-west U.S. as it will reach California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in the areas of Mexico.
Thereafter, tropical moisture will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the south-west region during the coming days.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause dangerous flood conditions, waste flows, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause some places to bring 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
The southwest region is expected to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially in most Arizona.
Due to the unseasonal nature of the tropical rain, sudden floods are likely to occur with rapidly destructive conditions.
It is advisable to venture into the desert under the fear of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause rivers to flow into the valleys and storms will bring local stormy winds and dust to the ground.
The arrival of the storm will bring heavy rain to some local levels off the coast of southern California.
Cool half an inch of rain is likely to cause small waste streams and narrow roads
This will be the first rain of the wet season.
A few scattered rainstorms will start arriving in Arizona on Sunday morning and early Monday before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
Some severe temperatures may be observed in October across the U.S. as the Northern Hemisphere is cooling, but the tropical remains very warm.
This is often due to changes in temperature in a short period of time.
Sunday is the best example of a dramatic temperature change in the central U.S.
The city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, have a temperature difference of about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the delayed summer heat will try to rise and spread again.
A large portion of the central and western U.S. will see the heat start in October that will range widely from the southern plains to the northeastern parts of the 80s.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a very high chance of more than average temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first fortnight of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing was watched by more than 20 million people.
Bret Kavanaugh, who filed the nomination by the Supreme Court and charged her with sexual assault in the year 1980, witnessed the Thursday testimony of Christine Bales on six television networks with more than 20 million views.
By the time broadcasters interrupted the regular program for Friday's last-minute turn, the political standoff had begun: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Sen. Jack Flake for the FBI will be conducting an investigation for a week of charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had caught her in a drunken state and tried to strip her of her clothes at a secondary school party.
Kavanaugh, in a hurried testimony, said he was 100 per cent sure it didn't happen.
There is a possibility that more than 20.4 million people saw that air was recorded by Nielsen.
The average viewership of the company was on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available that showed it.
And Nilsen usually had some trouble measuring people who looked in the offices.
To put it in perspective, the size of these spectators was the same as the play-off football game or the Academy Award.
The Fox News channel, whose Oppenion hosts supported Kavanaugh's appointment from the force, went ahead across all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Naelsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest grew more after the hearing.
There was a man who was in the center of the fire on Friday.
After the Central Republican office issued a statement that he would be voting in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras on his way to the lift for a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood for a few minutes keeping his eyes down as he was created, being broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
She was told, "You have power when many women are weak."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and had said before the lift was closed that he had a lot to report to the hearing committee.
When the Justice Committee voted on Kavanaugh's nomination for the entire Senate, all cable and broadcast networks were covering live broadcast hours.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which were requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced to some extent by a dialogue with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coon.
Following a conversation with the Queen and some of her later senators, Flake made his decision.
Fleck had the power in his choice because, it was apparent that the Republic was not in a position to allow Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson may accuse commentators of playing politics over Brexit issue.
In an interview with Prime Minister Theresa May's Times newspaper, she could be accused of "playing politics" and ignoring national interest with Britain's future in exchange for remarks about her leaving the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In an interview after her interview on the front page of the newspaper, she attacked her own by telling her former foreign minister Boris Johnson a checker's plan for Brexit, saying the UK and the EU's proposal to raise each other's tariffs was "totally irrational."
Ved Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson for lSU player's death
Police arrested 20-year-old basketball player, Ved Sims, on charges of fatally shooting the suspect.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and put in jail on charges of second-degree murder, the Bethon Raugh police department said.
Officers released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims' glasses were lost during the fighting.
Police found the glasses from the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Sivasan, the police said that he confessed to having shot Baid in a deadly manner.
His bond was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge's Paris Corner office released a preliminary report on Friday showing the cause of death as a result of a gunshot wound to the inside of the head.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fusitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the citizens who helped with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Eleva thanked the area's law enforcement for their "starting to give duty and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
Botton developed a 6-foot-6 forward on the day where his father, Avon, also played basketball for LSU.
In the last season's game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "was in the basement" due to Wyde's death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcanoes fly over the city of Mexico
The ash that flew from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighbor of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano's mouth for 24 hours after 183 gas and ash started coming out of it.
The center was monitoring multiple sounds and tremors.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ashes on the car's aerators in the neighborhood of Mexico City, such as Xhochimilco.
Geologists noted an increase in activity in the volcano that has been 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico on September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with the separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed with riot-stopping police and joined thousands of people on the first anniversary of Catalonia's atrocity over partition.
Face-covered groups supporting separatists who were pushed back by riot police threw eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets usually filled with tourists.
The police used their batons to stop the clashes and the crowd dispersed later in the day.
For several hours, anti-independence groups chanted "no apology, no apology" and countered with a cry of unity, "Spain will remain immortal."
Fourteen people received treatment for common injuries sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Even a year after the October 1 referendum, tensions remain high in the pro-independence region, this referendum is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists.
The voters chose to be independent with a huge majority, however, those who voted were less than those who were opposed to the partition as they mostly boycotted the vote.
According to several authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop those who went to vote at polling booths in all areas in violent clashes.
Anti-independence groups set up tents outside late on Friday night to prevent protests in favour of the national police
They had to find a way, but they had to find a way.
The 68-year-old Norris Termes, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protests against the separatists, said he had no further hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had the best time of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a special system of regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties have struggled to sustain that lunacy this year as many of their prominent leaders have either taken to exile themselves or are imprisoned for their role in mobilising public opinion and then declaring independence and awaiting trial.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded opponents in favor of the police on his phone, said the rift had been provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more painful," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing up as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to restore democratic values and condemn the repression we have faced from the Spanish government," he said.
London: A man has been arrested after a car entered the house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly rammed into a house in London.
The incident took place at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in the Bayanagrad Crescent.
Inspector Bob Bleming, who investigated, said the doors and buildings were also damaged.
There may also be a fire in a crossbow with a car at times.
Mangla Streak led Livingston to a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone ensured victory
The excited Livingstone surprised the Rangers as this was only the second defeat in Steven Gerrard's 18 games as manager of the iBrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference between the two as Gray Holt's team moved one level ahead of Habernia in the second.
This season, the Gerrards' team was away from the win and next Sunday they will face the leaders who are eight points behind.
Earlier in the day, Rangers will host Rapide Wienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
By then, Livingstone would have started his undefeated lead in the six-game division, with Holt not yet taste defeat after replacing head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Linwoodstone will lose the opportunity against visitors without an edge.
They should have been far ahead of Holt's team before they scored, having problems with their directing rangers all the way.
Scott Robinson was completely broken but kept his efforts in front of the goal, then only Alan Lithgow could lead his effort after sliding to meet Craig Holt's header to get around the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play against them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble on a piece-by-piece.
And that's how the important goal came about.
The Rangers accepted a free-kick and worked on the opening of Livingstone, joining Declan Gelagher and Robinson Megha to arrange the one who touched and scored from the middle of the box.
By that stage, the Rangers held on to possession but the home defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly largely had nothing to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morlos was forced to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was forbidden by Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor's foot and Lithgoe, a player from Livingston, set up for the game, hit wide.
Livingston's box continued to cross, and supplemented by Glenn Middleton's double penalty kick after being challenged by Halket and pushing a handball away.
'Extraordinary' from Livingstone - Analysis
Alsdair LeMont of the BBC Scotland on the playing field of Tony MacArthur
Amazing views and results by Livingston.
For a man, he was wonderful, began to rise above his expectations.
His style of playing and players have hardly changed since he was given the best game, but after Holt has come, he is highly credited for the way he has coached the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket handled the nicely arranged defense very well while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell in constant play.
The Rangers, however, were less motivated.
They were good as long as they were under Gerrad, they remained below his standards.
Their final ball was lacking - only once they exposed the home team - and it was time for Rangers to wake up who saw themselves in the middle of the table.
Argonne received a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) there was a smiley and brown sky in the faces as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They raised issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then proceeded to Cologne for the opening of a new huge mosque.
It is the largest city outside of Turkey.
Police gave security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but how many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Thousands of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - but their voices were heard by both Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to include him in the country.
The duel-making opposition characterized the visitor's reputation as a hero by some German Turks and discredited him as an autocrat by others.
Road accident: A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street junction on a busy road in the south-east area of the city.
The driver of the car was standing and the paramedics examined him, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came a month after a second cyclist died in a hit-and-run case on Children's Street, about a mile away from Saturday's clash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid this route.
Long Lantern Jail: Six officers injured in mishap
Six prison officials were injured after unrest in the prison of men with high security, the prison office said.2
The arrangement was breached on Sunday at about 09:30 BST on HMP Long Larten in Worcestershire and is still in progress.
To deal with the unrest, expert "Tornado" officers have been brought in, including eight co-conspirators and a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the problem of MMP Long Larten.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and sent to jail for a long time."
HMP Long Laurentin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's worst criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot-control officials were called to jail to solve a serious unrest that had hit workers with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa on Phnom Penh, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City scares off flash floods (the drought-affected areas may benefit)
The tropical pressure rarely hits Arizona, but something similar is going to happen early next week as the rest of the energy of Hurricane Rosa has taken the path of the entire southwest desert, leading to the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service for Western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phnom Penh, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake, has already been monitoring for flash floods for Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Rosa is expected to take a direct route to Phoenix, which will reach with rain from Monday morning.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted: "Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones in the 200-mile area of Phoenix have caused storms or tensions.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane in the 40 miles of the AZ border."
State-of-the-art National Hurricane Center models have forecast rainfall up to 6 inches scattered with 2 to 4 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other desert areas in the south-west, including central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive scattered rainfall with 1 to 2 inches up to 4 inches.
Out of the anxiety floods that are at risk, the Rossa rain can be a blessing as this area is drought prone.
Although floods are a matter of great concern, some of these rains are likely to be beneficial as the south-west is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second largest category, according to weather.com.
First, the route of the Hurricane Rossa landslides across Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
With a wind hurricane capacity of a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa is still 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is coming into contact with cold water in the Pacific and therefore its intensity is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected to hit the ground in Mexico with the speed of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Heavy rainfall can cause flooding throughout Mexico, causing a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of cool rain is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora which is expected to increase to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
After that, Rossa will take the route north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and cross to southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"Rosa or its remnants are expected to lead to major damage by very heavy rains in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to bring life-threatening floods and landslides in the blind and hilly areas of the desert
Midomer Norton attack: Four arrested in connection with attempted murder
A 16-year-old man has been arrested in Somerset on suspicion of attempting to murder three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man after being found with a sharp-edged weapon wound.
At 04:00 BST on Saturday, a teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were stabbed overnight in the Redstock area of Avon, Somerset police said.
The authorities have requested everyone to come forward and have footage of any mobile phone related to what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered, that is, the Democratic Party's anger.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the rigidity and abusive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the Democratic Party's "mines, anger" during the entire process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh, who was on trial before Congress on Thursday, denied the allegation by Christine Blaise Ford that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
The Ford was also examined during the hearing relating to the charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the American people showed the brilliance and quality and courage of the Kavanaugh incident."
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh confirmation is a confirmation of the vote for a jurist with the most complete legal mind of our time, a certified record of public service," he told the West Virginia supporter crowd.
The President specifically referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh regarding the importance of turning the Republican over in the interim elections.
"Five weeks away from the most important elections of our time.
"I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for the best candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and block."
The first key procedural vote in the House on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be no later than Friday, the senior GOP leader told CNN.
Thousands of people have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, this number is still rising
At least 384 people have died when an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with large waves crashing into the coast, leaving many far-flung, authorities said on Saturday.
When waves of six meters (18 feet) high came to the beach of the city of Paul on Friday evening, thousands of people gathered on the seashore to celebrate the festival, shaking the waves until their death and destroying what came on its way.
The earthquake was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the tsunami threat arose, people were still doing their activities on the seashore and did not immediately run away and suffered," said Sutopo Purpo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it rattled cars, logs, homes, anyone who hit the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) across the open sea.
Some people climbed onto the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were shifted to 24 centres in Palu.
In the aerial photos submitted by the disaster organization, it is seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the pools have turned and broken and there is water around the mosque.
On Saturday, the coast of the city began to shake after the earthquake
An estimated 2.4 million people were affected by the earthquake in the region.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's devastating earthquake was almost 200 times more than the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical situation of the city, which is close to the banks of the long narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the loss as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the structure of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that an additional 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the 300 km (190 mi) area of the northern coast of Palu, known as Donggala, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake, could have caused more loss of life and property.
The communication system in Donggala is "completely broken, no information", Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in its statement, adding that employees and volunteers are moving towards the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can tell more," he said.
The agency was severely reprimanded on Saturday for not providing information about the tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
Footage posted on social media showed a man screaming from the upper floor of the building to warn people that a tsunami was coming down the street.
Within minutes, a water-spout wall takes a collision along the coast with buildings and cars.
The Rangers couldn't find a quick fix.
The earthquake and tsunami unleashed a massive force that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military from Jakarta and other cities began to send cargo planes with aid materials, authorities said, but displaced people still need food and basic necessities items.
The city's airport is only open for relief operations and will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arranged a visit to the relief centers.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 800.
Its very bad.
When the employees of World Vision safely reached the city from Donggala to Palu where the employees were sheltered in the tadpole shelters in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me how many houses they had seen that were destroyed," he said.
Its very bad.
Even when aid groups started the disaster relief operation, some complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers were also barred from entering Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only come if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That hasnt happened yet.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Auliya Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Of course, this is a national disaster,' we can openly offer international help, but that's still not the case."
After Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the second night came to Paul, so his friends and family who were still missing were sitting there with the hope that miracles would happen with their loved ones that there would be unspeakable stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the body of her mother who had been living next to her for two days.
The coach of the Jendon Subandon, Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were captured from Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi was one of his students who was involved.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendo again recalled how the news was delivered to the paragliding community hours after the Rosa Rosa Hotel collapsed, sending WhatsApp messages to Palu rivals who were participating in the beach festival in a horrifying manner.
However, instead of two brown cheques, only one grey check was seen in his message.
"I don't think that means the message hasn't arrived," he said.
The thief took $26,750 while filling up an ATM at Newport in Lewes.
Thieves stole $26,750 when they were filling an ATM at Newport in Levy on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car in the entertainment complex was emptying the ATM and preparing to pay more. Danish McKerthy wrote in the news release.
While he was busy, another man "runs from behind Brink's employee" and the bag for delivery was stolen.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has any information related to their identity should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West changed his name to "Ye."
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formally known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was given the nickname Ye for a while and used the moniker title for his eighth album, released in June.
Saturday night's live program has changed before her appearance where she is due to launch her new album Yandhi.
He took a place on the show of singer Ariane Grande who canceled due to "emotional reasons," the show's creators said.
As well as a miniature of his current profession, West had earlier said that the term had religious significance for him.
"I think 'Y' is the word used frequently in the Bible and it means 'you' in the Bible," West radio host Big Boy Say said while discussing his album earlier this year.
"So, I am you, I am we, that is us.
He removed the canyon that had only one meaning, which only showed our good, our bad, our smiles to everyone.
This album sheds more light on what we are."
This is one of the many names that have been changed.
Sin Combs was known differently as Puff Daddy, P Diddy, or Diddy, but this year released its name of choice as Love and Brother Love.
The former West co-cobrator, Jay-Z, also duped Hyphen with or without capital.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use military force against any citizen.
Mexico's President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed that he would never use military force against civilians as the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador "will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people" at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday.
While the left-wing student movement was deploying its roots throughout Latin America, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Orb<0xC3><0xA9>dor pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to studyers and opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of jobs and educational opportunities has led to the youth being shifted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double AI funding.
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of research being done in that area, says investigator and AI practitioner Kai-fu Lee who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after the AI was announced by various parts of the U.S. Government, which also lacks formal AI strategy in the U.S.
By then, China had planned to host it last year: it aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Considering that all other countries are far behind the U.S., doubling the budget for AI research will be a good start, and we are looking forward to the next success in AI now," Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of a major breakthrough in the next AI in the U.S., Lee said in an interview to CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Miffin Harcourt, CEO of Shinovation Ventures, invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that could kill America's top-ranked Othello player, and then he was an executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China branch.
Lee welcomed technology rivalries such as the robotic challenge of the previous U.S. government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when would be, so as to help identify the next farsightedness.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking education leaders; it's corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recruited brilliant people from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. increase its AI efforts, Lee said,
"I think that those who have Ph.D. in AI should automatically be given green cards," he said.
China's State Council issued its plan in July 2017 to prepare the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The way the National Science Foundation and other government institutions finance U.S. researchers, China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people from educational institutions, but the quality of educational work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre to engage industry partners and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, the DARP announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative known as AI Next.
It currently invests more than $100 million annually for AI research for NFS.
By that time, no action has been observed for months in U.S. law to create a National Security Commission in the matter of Artificial Intelligence.
McDonald's voted for a referendum on whether or not to change the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve the decades-old rift with Greece that led to the suspension of their membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province known as Macedonia, says the name of its northern neighbor, refers to its claim over its territory, and its NATO and EU entry into the EU was barred from using vetoes.
In June, the two governments struck a deal based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the name change would reduce the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Selvic majority population.
President George Ivnov said he would not vote for a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether a minimum of 50 percent of the people needed to vote would come out to vote.
The question related to the reading of the ballot for the referendum: "Did you gain NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zev, argued that it was reasonable to pay the price for Macedonia, one of the countries formed by the collapse of Yugoslavia, and to get examples in organizations such as NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live independently under the roof of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," said Oliviera Giorgioveska, 79 in Skopje.
Though not legally binding, enough people in Parliament said they would stick to the outcome of the vote so as to arrive at a decision.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, in the last parliamentary election of 2016, when 66 per cent of the total registered voters cast their votes, only 16 per cent came out to vote, compared to 34 per cent.
"I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe," said Guzos Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaav, his wife Zorca and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum for a referendum to change the name of the country of Macedonia that would pave the way for him to join NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Carvadarkov was preparing a small stage in front of parliament and placing chairs in front of tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to connect by keeping our heads high, not through service," Kawadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we are happy.
"If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can be like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia coordination."
The Prime Minister said NATO membership will bring much-needed investment into Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the big majority will be in his favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zeve said after casting his vote.
He said that "yes" results "will ensure our future."
The poll, released by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, said 30 percent and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than necessary.
Another poll by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were thinking of voting on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful, a vote of 50 percent plus is required.
The failure of the referendum will mark the first time that the pro-Western government has taken over the government since May 22 last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of the city of Manchester navigates the entire Brigitte's defense for the goal.
Serggio Aguero and Raheem Stirling on Saturday beat Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, in a 2-0 win over Manchester City
Aguero showed that in his score in the 65th minute, it was ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton before hitting in the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He's been on the road a couple of times before he's pulled out of the Bronx.
Then, he gave the pass to his left side, where there was sterling.
To give Aguero back the ball, the English forward used his first touch in the box that used his right boot with a shot on the right side of the net to hit Brightton's keeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero was facing some problems at his feet," Pep Guardiola, the city's manager, told reporters.
We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That has happened too.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But it was Stalin who took advantage of the Sky Blues in the early days of the Premier League Scuffle.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball in Brighton Deep.
He sent the ball through the throw to Liroy Sein with a left flank.
Sei touched a little before heading off to a distant post.
Sky Blues sent the ball to the net before taking the ball outside the boundary.
Battles of the city of Hoffineh take place at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in the Champions League group at Rehn-Neker-Arena in Sinsim, Germany.
"Spoiler wants to play against Shazar.
With the Nationals removed from the play-off controversy, there was no good reason to force other starters.
But the always-competitive Shazar expects a round against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there is a play-off effect for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have confirmed the wild-card spot with at least a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to lock-up their first-class title.
Even though we're not playing to achieve anything, at least we can toss the rubber, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be at the highest level of any encounter this year with crowds and other forces.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?
The Nationals are yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly in a position to let Shesser pitch in such a situation.
Shearer, who starts his 34th, will give a bullpen session on Tuesday and pitching on the rest of his normal Sundays.
The Washington Right-Handler is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 stroke-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
In his mid-term address, the President spoke about the importance of the Republican Turnout, and complimented him on the choice of Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court of his own for the surrounding situation.
Everything we've done in the past year has been on the upswing.
Five weeks is the most important decision of our lives.
This is one of the biggest, big -- I'm running, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for the best response everywhere," he said.
Trump said, "You see a group of horrible, horrible extremists from the Democrats, that's what happens right now.
And they're committed to taking back power by using the tools anyway, you see the mettle and melancholy.
They don't know who they're actually harming, and who they're crushing to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, we don't want to give them that."
"Democrats are on a mission to create "opposition and obstruction," he said.
And you see that in the last four days, he called the Democrats "angry and low and evil and untrue."
He gave the ranking of Democratic Sen to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Dye addressed it as Feinstein, which received tremendous appreciation from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you get rid of the document?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what.
"No, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The church is no longer a large church.
For those who speak their mind, it is inconsequential
When I was asked by my local party workers to cast a vote for me, it was hardly surprising.
At the end of the day, I'm the latest in Labour MPs to say that you're not welcome - everyone is saying for our sake.
I also had a similar deal with my parliamentary colleague John Ryan as she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, Jeremy Corbyn criticized the censure motion for disagreement with me.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, which had disagreed with Jeremy's previous leaders on similar issues due to the outbreak.
A notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
As a local Labour MP, most of my Friday night GC meetings were the same as eight years ago.
It is sad that today this is not the tone of many meetings and the glory of "compassionate, humble" politics has long been forgotten, although it has begun in Vaastu.
Obviously, it is clear that different ideologies are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each consultation is evaluated on the basis of whether the leadership of the party is acceptable or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, with whom I had previously had a similar political view as a co-worker, I would take a U-turn and expect situations for which I would never agree – whether it was for national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I give a speech in public - and it doesn't really make any difference to what I'm saying - after a nasty comment on social media comes a call about my choice not to be, denying the center's politics, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And my experience is not the same.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments pointed out to me are political.
I am committed to the professionalism and determination of those professionals who face genderist and racist ideologies every day but never shamed.
In this age of politics, the most frustrating part is how the level of harassment has been made normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a comprehensive church, and every "no-confidence" proposal or change of the rules of choice is becoming associated with the party.
In the last two years, I have been advised several times that I should be stressed to keep my head down, not be so dumb and then I will "get well."
But that's not what I did in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, agitated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which left behind my business school, I sought support for the best public services for those who need them the most - whether as a local councillor or a minister of government.
In the last election, I have never hidden my politics.
There was no way in the Notingham East that my policy views, and the current leadership, could have been confused in the field of dissent
All I can say to those who are promoting the proposal on Friday is that when the country is moving towards Brexit, it will harm homes, businesses and our public services. I do not want to waste time and energy in showing my loyalty to the Labour Party leaders.
But I do not have a message for the notingham moment, it is for my voters, who are members of the labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that the threat of any kind of election or political gains will not hamper my work which I want to do and is in the interest of all of you.

IR 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible IR goes to the top
Two late attempts may have narrowed the final result, but Nisandeh was also eligible to win the Iyer-in-extraordinary tournament match of the day.
It's now at the top of the list, the only invincible side of the decade.
In the end, it was his best defense, as well as his best chance to take the home team forward and coach Peter Murchie had all the rights to be happy.
"We've done this test on our game, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy."
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Irene deserves credit, she took her chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, replaced by Frazier Clemmo, put on the rear front, but a yellow card for Scotland's Cape Rory Hughes, published by the Warriors, allowed Marlowes to show the number, and Jason Negot Begott caught an irreplaceable effort.
Klimo increased the Ire with a penalty, half-time before he scored exactly and converted the Ire to a solo effort to make the Ire 17-5 at break time.
But Melrose made a good start to the second attempt, and Patrick Ederson's attempt was replaced by Begott's five points to reduce independence.
At that time, the Rudrih note had a serious injury, which gave a stretch and then, from the start again, a modified attempt by Klimo led Stafford McDowell to further the Ayer.
While Iron's acting captain Blair McPherson received the yellow-card, Melrose paid at the end of a serious push to an additional person with an uncontrollable Bruce Clooney's attempt.
However, the home-side came back and when Straw Hutchinson was given a yellow card to help him get through the penalty line-out without a ball, McPherson touched the back of Adair Moul.
Klimo was transformed, the car started it again, after Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong and sent him to Flanker Gregor Henry for Homer's fifth attempt.
Even today, the sport's star restaurant is set for a new career in the industry.
Still, the sport's Tarlo Ford Kieran is ready to go into the hospitality industry, after learning that he has been nominated as the director of a line-sanctioned restaurant.
Jack Jarvis, 56, appears on the BBC's popular show, which he is writing and co-starring with long-time co-star Greg Bumpfield.
Both have announced that the show will have the next new series at the end and it looks like Kieran is planning for a post-cragling life.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source in the Scottish Sun has hinted that Kiran wants to be included in Glasgow's "tremendous restaurant business."
‘The sea is ours’: Landlocked Bolivia hopes the Pacific will re-open the way for them
The Navy patrols a large number of naval headquarters in La Paz.
A public building has a flag of the color of Assam.
Sailing destinations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are littered with the motto: "The sea is officially ours."
It is our duty to restore it."
The memory of a coastal land lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still vivid - just as the Pacific Ocean wants to flow once again.
Perhaps those hopes have been at their highest level for decades, as the speakers await a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"There is a sense of unity and peace in Bolivia, and there is certainly hope for a positive outcome," said Roberto Cailajila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bollywood celebrities will see the ICG's decision on a big screen across the country, hoping to see the tribunal in The Hague in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of unscheduled discussions - they are obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a smooth transition to the Chilean sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's miraculous indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - has a number of rides in Monday's regime.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," we swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and if it does, it will change slightly.
The Netherlands-based UN has no power to hand over Chile's territory, and has determined that this will not determine the outcome of a possible story.
Paz Zaret, a Chilean expert in international law, said that the ICJ decision comes six months after the final argument was heard, indicating that "the subject was not complex."
Due to the pandemic, it may have been delayed for the past four years.
The issue of access to the sea is being hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zorte said.
He also said that the actions of the Iranian government have undermined any sense of security.
It's hard to talk about anything and everything, but it's hard to talk about anything else.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welts, rejected the idea that the decision-making by the court was unusually slow.
Monday will bring "a unique opportunity for Bolivia to unveil a new era of relations with Chile" and bring an "end to 139 years of mutual disagreement with consensus" for Chile, he said.
Calzadia also denied that Morales - still the most popular of Latin American presidents - used maritime issues as a political base.
Bolivia never gave up its right to reach the Pacific Ocean, connected them.
They are trying to show that they need to get out of the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until it believes in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that if he does not trust Washington, his country will not take the initiative to destroy nuclear weapons.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Saturday.
He called on the leaders to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore.
The comments come in the form of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, after Singapore, for resuming a three-month-long standoff over nuclear diplomacy.
Ree says it is a "pipe dream" that keeps the sanctions and the protests from the United States intact and will bring the North to its knees at any time in an effort to end the Korean War.
Pyongyang is wary of agreeing to the declaration without the implementation of the first important disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal, which the country sees as the only option for its own scheduled security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of the Kim-Tram.
The Paris fashion show showcases the latest style of wearing a masta on a wide scale, so the high street stays with you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or stop the sun altogether, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a series of uniquely large head gear for their SS19 collection on the road, setting the style at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer's high-precision hats have made Instagram vegetative and these designs below the catwalk have created an attraction in front of their eyes.
The stand-out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat decorated by a fan-like long beam, which gave way to the models' heads.
Other over-emphasis materials, including watermelon ornaments, a wonderful hat, and pineapples - but they weren't designed to keep your head cool.
Thomas Brown also revealed the secret of a strange mouthful - and only for Halloween's time.
A lot of people had their hair dyed and looked more like a labrador than a lab coat.
One construction was found with scuba diving gear with snowbelts and black glasses, while the other looked like molten ice cream cones.
And if you're looking for a great brand, you're in luck.
Those keeping an eye on the style are speculated to have large bonnets making their way onto the big roads.
The outer top of La Bomba's high-heeled shoes looks attractive, with a two-foot-long brick with a pual hat that is visible all the way from Rihanna to Emilie Ratajkowski.
Sampraday's label was on the back of the most widely circulated unusable hat on social media, sending out a large composition under the catwalk - a pual beach bag was as large as the swimming suit Pahreli model.
The burnt orange Rafia bag was a stand-out piece in a Paris fashion wicce 'La Rivera SS19 compilation with a white leather handle on top of the cut with Rafia frying.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm hopeful that big hats and beach bags will hit the high street next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for our services.
John Edwards: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Scotland's autonomous schools have a track record of academic excellence and have been relentless with a set of outstanding exam results in 2018, reinforced only by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other community endeavors.
The school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) with over 30,000 students in full Scotland, is providing the highest level of service to its students and alumni.
The goal of the autonomous schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, to pursue their chosen careers and to maintain their place as global citizens.
In the form of education, which transforms and implements a school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and taboo subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, he will understand."
If you speak in a language that touches his heart."
When we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, it is a powerful reminder that we can't just trust English.
This year's results show that languages are at the top of the league with the highest degree of achievement in autonomous schools.
A total of 68 per cent students who studied foreign languages have secured a higher grade.
The data collected from the 74-member school of the SCIS shows that 72 per cent of the students have achieved the category in the medallion, while 72 per cent are German learners, 69 per cent are French learners and 63 per cent are Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages are being taken as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects in the autonomous school curriculum and elsewhere in the form of subject selection
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent were held accountable for language skills undermining the reasons given by the employer for struggling to fill the vacant positions.
Language skills are essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
This skill is essential in a global world with more potential employment opportunities for languages.
Even if they choose a career, if they learn a second language, they will get the real benefit of such a life-skill.
Being able to communicate directly in foreign countries, a multilingual person will be put in front of the competition itself.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 Britons in 2013, 75 percent were unable to communicate adequately in a foreign language and the only one with French is a bilingual, the only language spoken by 15 percent.
This is the reason why it is important for today's children to get involved in language education.
Children with multiple languages, especially developing economies, will be equipped with the right opportunities to find meaningful employment.
Each school in Scotland will have different languages, which teach.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that will be considered most important for the UK until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, which are specialized in the field of education.
Scottish independent schools are famous for giving children the opportunity to learn, which will prepare them and divide them up with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In today's global business era, it cannot be denied that the future of the country is very important, which is why it is reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer options of interest, diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
This should happen.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
To start the Labron Sunday in St. Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James is almost complete, with Los Angeles Lakers Matte making his debut.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a preseason opener against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be seen how many minutes the game will be played.
It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the leak's official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudeau tweeted that James would probably play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, after the study, James was asked about his plans to take the Lakers to a "six-game presidential schedule."
"I don't need to be in a position to play in this tournament," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launched a series of campaign rallies in West Virginia from tonight.
Last week was the first of Trump's five scheduled radio stations to have a halt in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote supporting the Supreme Court's decision to fill vacancies, Trump is aiming to seek support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republican Congress is in a crisis of losing control when votes are cast in November.
What's the date of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia Rally scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia train live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address a Supreme Court hearing this week on Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct by the FBI's anticipating Senate confirmation vote on hold for a week.
But the main purpose behind these developments is to help the Republicans cope with the November setbacks.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign says that the purpose of this five-relay next week is to "enable volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the presidents present in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
Trump's campaign spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "The control of Congress is so important to their agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible because we are in a busy campaign period."
According to West Virginia Metro News, plans for Wesbanko Arena in Whilling, the tonight's rally "may bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and take coverage from the Pittsburgh media."
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump visited West Virginia on Saturday, winning the state by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to aid Patrick Morris, a receptive to the West Virginia Republican Senate, who lags behind in the impeachment.
Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said: "This is not a good sign for Morris that he has to make an effort to advance in the presidential election."
U.S. men's soccer team looking forward to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, there were only four groups on Saturday afternoons, which was probably the need for this Rider Cup.
The pendulum swinging in motion is an all-in-one invention sport concept, but a player who actually believes in it and then never takes part in competitions like this.
So, where's the momentum going now?
Because it went on all day, Jordan Spieth said, "They had a six-digit boost and now it's four, so we're giving it a little momentum."
Europe has certainly benefited from four points with 12 more points in the game.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that the air is a bit of a pro and they have a lot of encouragement, not as Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together on a full day and each receives three points out of four.
Speed was molded from T-green to green and is next to the example.
The festival began to get louder as its rounds were running, while A and Thomas were on the way down to take an important put-on sink to take a four-all-scaver match in the match.
The putt that gave them victory in the 15th match was met with the same screams, which show you that the U.S. team is not out of this.
"You've just woken up, and you've got to wake up," he said.
All of the players have now left.
18 holes to fill the hole.
The only player with more points by Spieth and Thomas in the last two days is Fancysco Molinari and Tommy Flitvadu, which is the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's azibe is also a cult duo of four to four and no one can make a mistake.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who didn't kick off Saturday afternoon, but kept them from kicking off Saturday morning, Friday afternoon after nine o'clock.
A run and the way their energy flows on both sides of the tumultuous crowd, it seems, they are the losing players on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player for a possible European win, so that the sun sets towards Fleetwood or Molinari than Li Golf National.
In particular, the two are together on different halls.
However, European pride is ahead of its time.
When he was paired with Alex Noreen, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero.
Sweep two doubles on a bogey and nine in front of the Spaniard and the Swede in a hall in which he will never get close to climbing.
There is no one to help you get out of the hotel on Sunday.
It's very exciting to see foreball and foresaw closeness, because due to the interaction between the couples, they don't take the advice they give, and that's how tactics can change in one moment.
Europe has done well as a team, so far and in the final days, a significant boost, but the Forsem season has shown that the team is keen to fight the U.S., which was celebrating some of the special status quo.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe gained a 10-6 lead.
After Saturday's foreplay and a 10-6 lead over the United States, the European rider will make the right call on the final day of the Cup in four matches.
The pair of Yomi Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have led the country with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to take four points in the National so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European side wants to preserve the Harle Trophy in Hazleton a year ago and take the series 3-1 by taking control of the American team in the morning in football.
The U.S. had more resistance in the forums, winning two matches but couldn't work in losses.
To save the trophy, Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four points at the same time, while he and Molinari dubbed "Mollywood," after a fantastic weekend, this is only the second pair to earn four points in their opening match in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in Foreball, he scored another stunning 5&4 to beat Woods and American player Broyson Dashambu.
Woods, who showed himself in two matches on Saturday, has been shown to be an impressive outburst of intelligence, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches to Foreballs and Forces.
Justin Rose rested for the morning for the foreballs. Dustin Johnson and Brooks came back to fellow Henrik Stanson in the 2&1 loss to Koepka - finishing first and third in the world.
This was not the case in Europe at the time of a pleasant euphoric day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the United States with two points on Saturday.
He led Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Polter to a 2&1 win in the Foreballs and then hit them back and forth to beat the Poles and Rory McLaroy by 4&3, losing two holes early in the season.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two teams have hit back after losing four points in a row, but only Fury's side needs to be pulled in to save the trophy as holders.
After a couple of days, it looks like it's going to be the same on Sunday.
North Korea will unilaterally disarm without trust, there is no way out, he said.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions in the United States had deepened his distrust of the United States, and there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly last year that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not get any response from the US," he said.
Without trust in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri reiterated Washingtons counter-argument to a standard approach to denuclearization of North Korean grievances, North Korea would gradually make the right decisions as they would be rewarded, her statement felt appropriate, not directly denying unilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past
While Kim vowed to work towards "decentralization of the Korean Peninsula," Rei released a joint speech for the first time on June 12 between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, the US president serving in Singapore and the leader of North Korea, and Trump promised North Korea's security.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also called for tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insisted on ""first disarmament"" and raised the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its objective through sanctions and a restrictive approach, even as it expressed a disaster on the declaration of the end of the war."
The assumption that restrictions can bring us to the knees is just a dream of those who ignore us.
But the reality is that the constant restrictions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in five months: "This is the party for the problem of denuclearization, not the U.S., the Korean Peninsula would not have come under such a standoff."
When he told the UN, even since then, the tone of Ree's speech was dramatically different from the previous year. "Mr. Evil President" Trump required a general meeting after referring to Kim as a "rocket man" on a suicide mission that puts the U.S. mainland on the target of North Korea's rockets.
Trump, who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament this year, at the United Nations, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is free of nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit, "If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking action.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Committee's sanctions must continue to be enforced vigorously and without fail until we have a full, final, standardized assurance of the destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 for bidding to raise funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Rein on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his final tour did not go well.
"He left Pyongyang in July by saying that North Korea's progress had only taken place in the hours leading up to its condemnation for "criminals-like-numbers."
North Korea has vowed to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures" at a meeting with Moon this month.
He said Kim told him that the "unfortunate measures" he wanted to take were moves to improve security and relations with Washington, as Trump did in Singapore.
Harvard students take a break from studying.
This year, the new Harvard University faculty has earned more than a bachelor's degree to nurture the growing macho culture that is being studied by Kaifin-filled 'all-nighters'.
When it came to how to take care of yourself, the world's first-class university children saw an educationist go unaccompanied.
Charles Qazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham & Women's Hospital, designed the curriculum structure, which he believes to be the first in the US.
After talking about the impact of learning sleep deprivation, he was inspired to start this cell.
At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Now, my senior year, why am I being called alone?"
"So far no one has told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told the Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course explains how good sleep habits help students in the academic field and athletic performance as well as enhance their general well-being.
Paul Berreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to start a course after students were deprived of sleep during the week.
The cell lasts for hours, which includes a series of interactive tasks.
A section features a room of student accommodation, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, instructors, and books about the effects and light of caffeine and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep time.
In the second section, participants are asked how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the complex with an interactive icon, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know about the health effects from choosing to smoke cigarettes," he added.
He said a culture of 'all-night pulling' pride still exists, adding that the increased pressure on modern technologies and students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Making sure you have good quality sleep should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to deal with stress, fatigue, and anxiety – even for weight loss, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation that causes them to be constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kazisler design the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this room opened his eyes and inspired him for the campus-wide classroom.
The next step, they expect, is that all these postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Qazisler recommended that students learn about the harmful effects of 'blue light' released by electronic screen and LED lighting systems to go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and that the killers cause sleep problems by disrupting your circadian rhythm.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meng Gould beats Gerald's men
The Rangers faced a second battle of the distant blues as a disgruntled side due to Dolly Manga's strike losing 1 - 0 to Steven Gerrard in Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to enter their first win on the road since St. Johnstown's 4-1 win in February, but Gary Holt's team left Gerrard's second defeat as a manager of 18 games in his favor.
Menga hit seven minutes before half time and there was also no motivation to balance the ranges.
When the Rangers reached sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and only behind the Hibernian at the distance of the goal.
Clearly throwing an object from a distance can cause more trouble in the store for rangers after the Lines Man Banana Spence was moved under a head wound treatment.
Garrard made eight changes to the side, which in the past made him a place in the semi-finals of the Batfried Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livi11, who took a point from Hurts last week and the way his well-drilled outfit had stifled the breath of his opponents at every stage, he was delighted.
He may have been the leader of the Rangers, but Livingston did a lot with the ball that he had.
They only needed two minutes to see the gods when Menga's first-ever let-off Scott Pittman sent through the goal but the midfielder grabbed his big chance.
A deep-capped Jacob Free-kick then met Captain Craig Hulkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithogo, could only expand in the later post.
The Rangers took control but in the final third, there seemed to be more hope than belief about his game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been fined fifteen minutes because he and Steven Laures clashed but referee Steven Thomas rejected Columbian's appeal.
Rangers used only half-shots before two on goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassa's Coolidge header and a weakened Ove Azaria strike.
While Livin's 34th minute opener might be against the run of the game, no one can deny that he alone was worthy of his well-being.
Again, the Rangers failed to work with deep Jacobs set-pieces.
Scott Airfield didn't react as Deccan Gallagher hit the ball on Scott Robinson, who maintained his calm to pick up Menga for an easy finish.
Gerard moved to work on the break as he swapped Cooliebelly for Ryan Kent and the winger's slot in Switch Morlos provided an almost immediate effect but the dominant Kelly was blocked from his line.
But Livingstone continued to play with Leithgo and Helket by hitting the long ball high enough to keep visitors amused.
Holt's side could increase their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood well enough to block Jacob before Lithgo came from the corner.
A penalty was claimed on Rangers in place of Glenn Middleton because he messed up with Jacobs but again saw Thomas far away.
Tag: the search for the ghetto
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, the mainstay of science, Giger counter-pop culture, as well as the seemingly unlikely Gaypop scientists in the 1950 film "Balls of Coronado," became the mainstay by starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a gigar counter, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear earphones, you can actually hear the effects delivered by mineral radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, he's popping sure!"
"Hans" Giger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the search for his name is alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to 'Watch' Bad Cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines as part of treatment teach the immune system to recognize disease cells.
The method involves extracting the patient's immune cells, turning them into a lab.
They can then "see" a normal protein for many cancers and then be re-injected.
A single test vaccine shows promising results in many cancer patients.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine who taught the immune system to identify disease cells found that her uterine cancer had subsided in 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, turning them into a laboratory so that they can see the normal protein in many cancers called HER2, then re-integrating the cells.
Professor J. Burzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increases the development of many types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer," explained Prof. Bernzoski.
He has worked in a type of leukemia therapy with an approach to learning how to extract immune cells from patients and how to target cancer cells.
After her SNL appearance, wearing a mega hat, Nayi West hit the pro-Trump Dietrib.
It didn't go well
Kanye West's Horio was called up to the studio after a thrilling performance praising his U.S. during Saturday Night Live. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night known as Ghost Town, in which she wore the Make America Great Hat, she continued to fight the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
Often I talk to an American person and they say: "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
"If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago."
SNL began the show with a skit by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's rant was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether or not Rock was trying to make fun of West with the posting.
Also, Weste complained to the audience that he had an adverse time wearing his headband.
They beat me to the back of the stage.
"""Don't go out wearing that hat,"" he said."
They've pissed me off!
According to the Washington Examiner, he said, and then they say I'm in a sinking position."
West went: "You want to see the sinking place?" Saying that he "would wear my Superman hat, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
Try to find love."
Her comments earned Hurrio at least twice from the audience and members of the SLAN were frustrated, Verity reported, with one person telling the publication there: "There was a sharp snafu in the entire studio."
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the ILV It song by dressing up as a parier bottle.
West was supported by TPUSA group head Kendall Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous souls: Thank you for standing in the crowd."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "who she is and she's absolutely wonderful."
But I didn't choose to reward anyone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their "art") who I believe is embracing that ideology and speaking out what is harmful to my community.
Its free.
So we are," she added.
Prior to the show, saying it was now known as "Kennedy West," rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg's name was Snoop Lion and certainly the musical legend's Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist already known as Prince.
Man tried to kill me in a hotel room
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after killing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police said the incident took place in the town of Bishkek.
He is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kate Harrington hits me on the toxic mardani.
John Snow is best known for his role in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on the screen mean that young people feel they must be strong to get respect.
Rather than with The Sunday Times culture, Kitt states that he believes 'something went wrong' and raised the question of how to overcome the toxic mardanigi problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt too strongly to address the issue.
"""I feel personally, very strongly at this moment - where have we done anything wrong with manhood?"""
"What are we teaching in terms of the problem that men want us to have when they're growing up?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleness due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is birth and what is being taught?
What is it taught in TV and the streets that young boys feel this particular part of being a man should be?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because something obviously went wrong for the young men."
In an interview, he admitted that he would not be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when he comes at the end of next summer.
From November Kit will star the lead actor in Sam Shepard's return to True West, the story of the filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks of meeting his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, so she gave me my future family and my life here.'
Rose played the character Jon Snow's love interest in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the location of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China records 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases that were marked by changes from the past were motivated by sex.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to large parts of China as a result of infectious blood transfusions.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health officials said that the number of people infected with HIV has almost reached zero.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was discouraged in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be severe.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use HIV drugs judiciously as part of an effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee leaked the data of the GOP Senator, the blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. Maxson Waters on Saturday refuted allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information of three Republican American senators on members' Wikipedia profile.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserts that the claims were handled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, and more hateful lies, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information disseminated includes the home address and phone number for the U.S. Sens. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both Utah.
The information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Nominee Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court appeared online on Thursday.
The three men were arrested after being questioned by the police.
A conservative site like Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the post's source was linked to the Waters' office and published information about a water staff member, Hill said.
These accusations are completely false and a complete lie, Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
"These allegations are completely false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately sparked online criticism, including former White House press secretary Erie Fletcher.
"This denial is in a rage," Fletcher wrote.
This suggests that she is unlikely to become a member of Congress.
They don't get angry when someone is accused of something they didn't do.
They should not be punished.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They need to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer was comparing Kavanaugh's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats, who were accused by angry critics during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also shared his thoughts on Twitter to unite voters in the mid-term elections.
"If it's the truth, it's the truth," he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims."
We will ensure that the perpetrators will be declared, and that "they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to me and any members of any staff."
John's English Strikes Again review showed Rowan Atkinson's spike spoof low.
It's now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new film with British Slant and that applies to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and changed lives again with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will we be self-deprecating about how we are creating new export opportunities for the country?
At the rate at any one, fairly uphill from the front, a face-to-face John's English has a license to recreate anything a second time - although its sign's name is more than anything else that it's a broad-spectrum composition designed for a non-English - filming fields.
He's definitely an accomplished secret agent who, despite his strange pretences, Mr. Bean's doll and a doll of that boy have found little clues to the fire theme tune's Riots at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It's originally based on Atkinson, an international man of traveler and mystery who once played in a Barclays TV ad leaving the chaos behind him.
This is one or two of the coolest moments in the latest JE Outings.
I was in love with Johnny English when he approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit of armor, and the rotor blade was wrapped against his helmet for some time.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the laughter feels very low and unremarkable, especially with "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offering comedy as their own self-confident component.
It seems that this humor is made for younger children rather than adults, and for me John's English's useless adventures aren't as focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gigs in the persona of the discoverer and Bean.
Now the best local support is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's spy's super-secret web network, exposing the identity of agents across Britain in the field, for the fall of an agent on duty - a regrettable minor role for Kevin Alden.
This is the final straw for a Prime Minister who is a man who is already suffering from political obscurity: Emma Thompson works very well with this QC-Teresa-May character but there is nothing special in the script to work with.
Her secret advisors notified her that as each active spy compromised she would have to bring someone out of retirement.
This means fighting John's English with himself, who is now employed as a school-master in a posh establishment, but how to be an undercover operative is proving off-the-records: Here are some good gags, as the English spy's rock type does.
The English are sent back to Whitefall for an immediate briefing and reunited with his longtime ex-buff suffering from syphilis, re-played by Ben Miller.
Buff is a married man, manned on a submarine commander, has a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicky Peddine is a bit useless.
So Batman and Robin Her Majesty's have returned to the action of getting very wrong on the Secret Service, in which Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Opelia, has fought the bulletova.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Karishmai is falling into the clutches of a tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: played by the evil Jason Volta, Jack Lacy.
The English and the bogey begin their Odyssey of Farsical High Jeans, assuming the servant's disguise, they set fire to a flash game restaurant; they sneak up on Volta's luxury yacht and smuggle in; and the English netizen triggers a pure chaos as he attempts a virtual head to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All obstacles have been taken back for that final sequence, but as it is enough and fun, there is very little about the whole thing children's TV.
A beautiful middle ground.
And I can't help thinking about other Johnny English films that happen: Can the British film industry give Roan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Rejecting the worker, he prepares a plan for the Brits to work in a four-day week but pays for five days.
The Jeremy Corbyn Labor Party is on track to consider a revolutionary plan in which the Britons will work four days a week - but receive payments for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's boss employees to go through the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution so that they can be given more days.
He would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but would still be taking the same pay home.
Sources said that the idea will be "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The Trade Union Congress has supported a four-day week to take advantage of the changing economy for workers.
The policy is expected to be announced before the end of the review year, a senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Green Party will not be the first party to support the idea, supporting a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this wish has not been currently endorsed by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Four-day working week is not the policy of the party and is not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonald last week used the Labour Conference to dispel his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to get power back from 'faceless directors' and 'professors' in utility companies.
Shareholders in water companies cannot get their entire share back as the Labour Government can 'deduct' on the basis of alleged wrongs.
He has also endorsed plans to put employees on the company board and create inclusive honorarium funds to enable employees to handle 10 percent of private sector companies' equity, which stand to pay out from annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lynde Graham, John Kennedy speak "60 Minutes" about whether or not Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change his mind.
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh raises the question of whether the final vote on the nomination has been delayed by at least a week in the Supreme Court and whether the Bureau's findings can force any Republican senator to support it.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pele asked the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, could the FBI find anything that would inspire him to change his mind?
South Carolina seemed more free than its ally.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course."
I said, I went to the hearing and said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, he removed the charge, he said, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, determined, and unstoppable."
However, Graham's view appears to be located in the stone.
My brain is about Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to make a dynamite charge," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Bret strongly denied it, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one could open the mouth of him who had been called by his name.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival will host an annual music festival, with a very impressive line-up of timers and an equally impressive goal; an end to the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, thousands of people will flock to the Great Law of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival, not just to enjoy the acts of Majon Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the ceremony's goal of ending Daron poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was called in 2012, is an area of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that actively seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight against it.
To receive a free ticket to the ceremony (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), musicians had to complete a series of tasks, or "works," such as e-mailing a world leader, calling, or other meaningful measures to help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free program of music a real treat to persuade people to call for action, that there are only other cases of so-called "clickTVs" - people believing that by signing an online application or sending a tweet they are making the right difference?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, emphasizing various goals.
It says these actions have inspired world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in promises and policies to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and declarations derived from its own works, of which at least $10 billion has been distributed or the funds have been raised.
The group estimates that safe funds have a direct impact on approximately 649 million people worldwide so far.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and bureaucrats, is committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" in some of the key commitments pledged to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"On behalf of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens alike with your support, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ulm, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, told a gathering at a live music event in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 steps were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project The Power of Nutrition that will reach 5 million women and children suffering from malnutrition.
In response to a FAQ on its website, "What do you think we can do to end drug poverty?"
The global citizen replied: "It will be a long and bitter road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements in front of us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Jenny Mona are some of the acts involved in this year's event in New York, which will be organized by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
Russian could use the U.S. Navy for blockades to hinder energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can take the help of its navy if necessary to prevent a confrontation on the Russian energy markets, including the Middle East.
Zink alleged that Russia's annexation of Syria - significantly, where it is running at the invitation of the Vaidya government - was a hoax of exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want the power of the broker as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to resolve it.
"The United States has the capability of our Navy, and the maritime route is open to blocking, if necessary, to ensure that its energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees at a ceremony organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization and those who have their own identity as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and he noted that they were almost identical.
He described Russia as a dangerously sea-based economy "springing on a pony," saying that "the economic option on Iran and Russia, to a lesser extent, is to take advantage of and opt for fuel."
The statement comes as the Trump administration is working to increase its cheap liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to European countries instead of Russia.
To complete that Murad, Trump government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, tried to get Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, Berlin has become Moscow's "prisoner."
Russia has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a full-fledged economic project.
Russia's argument that the USA's strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe that energy cannot be a tool to use pressure and that consumers have the right to choose suppliers."
Germany has not been dogged by the U.S. stance and it has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from the European Energy Policy as well as the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kampf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said that I have a big objection to the third country interfering in our energy supply.
The White House has said it will "take a hard look" at the 2020 presidential race.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would adopt a "strong stance" in the running for president after the midterm elections.
War in the Town Hall of Massachusetts, Calicut, confirmed that the running for president would be held.
According to The Hill newspaper, it's time for women to fix our broken government by attacking Washington, and the top of it is women.
After November 6, I will take a strict stance in the running for president.
During the war, President Donald Trump showered on Trump during the town hall and said he was "taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm ashamed of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's war has been clearly criticized.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We have to investigate the FBI before we vote."
However, in a survey released on Thursday, the majority of Warren's candidates do not think that the war should be run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said the Senate should not take this step.
Thirty-two percent supported the move.
The survey found support in a 38 percent collaboration with former governor Davel Patrick, who further supported Run, and in a 48 percent opposition.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have emerged in the context of a possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes track Palin's PTSD on Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old spent a year in Iraq in the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case.
Speaking at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sarah told the audience about Donald, "I understand the pain of the families of the soldiers who returned after suffering the consequences of my own son's condition, returning and some injured."
Describing his arrest as a "room elephant" proof, Palin said of his son and other veterans returning from the war, "They have changed, they have returned to the roots, they seem to be surprised at what the country gives their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military in return for what they have given to the country."
Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett said she was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and for interfering in domestic violence cases and possessing drugs.
The DCA of 18 states has supported the challenge against the new shelter policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, denying the policy gang or victim of domestic violence to shelter.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court on Friday in Washington to support the shelter wingers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name is Grace V. The Sessions Suit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She was teased by her partner’s ‘and her violent gang member sons’, but her request for asylum was rejected by U.S. officials on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the States supporting Grace wrote to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which has raised a large number of applicants for the U.S. Asylum, as the country is facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy quashed the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum against domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "rejects decades-old state, federal, and international law."
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided subject to certain facts and circumstances and that such a statute violates that principle, the F<0xC3><0xBC>nd-of-Court said in a statement.
The attorneys further argued that the policy denying immigrants entry was shocking to the U.S. economy, which worked to become their entrepreneurs and provide "essential labor supply."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to provide shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
On June 11, the sessions announced the policy, saying that for those who leave their homeland, shelter is available due to fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
"Acelium was not meant to solve all the serious problems that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Rescue efforts have been intensified to find survivors of the double-digit death toll in Palu.
The situation was even worse for the survivors.
Reema Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who consoled her child at the Evacuation Centre in Palu city, said, "There is a lot of tension.
Every minute, the ambulance brings the dead body.
There is a lack of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up items lying in the water and trying to save whatever was found.
Hundreds of injured and a 7.5-magnitude earthquake in Adhura, as if the kidneys had emerged in hospitals.
One of the injured, Dwye Harris, had broken her back and shoulder and was resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, as patients were often treated there due to strong aftershocks.
He looked at his wife and daughter, who were in the fifth floor of the hotel when the earthquake shook them.
There was no time to save ourselves.
Harris, who is in town for a family wedding, told the Associated Press: I felt like I was trapped under the hotel rubble.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was no sound.
I don't know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they are safe."
US envoy accuses China of 'threatening' with 'propaganda aids'
A four-page advertisement in a government Chinese newspaper in the U.S. cited the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, a week after the announcement, the U.S. ambassador to Beijing accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday – referring to the supplement of the announcement of China Daily’s Des Moines Register, the state’s best-selling newspaper – accused the U.S. Congress of interfering in the November 6 election, which China rejected.
Trump alleged that China tried to interfere in the US elections, US officials told Reuters that a new phase of intensifying the US campaign to increase pressure on Munjab China has begun.
It's common for foreign governments to resort to advertising to promote trade, but China and the United States have currently been mired in a trade war, and both have imposed new tariffs on each other's imports.
The trade war was initially designed to target exporters in states such as China's reactionary tariff lova, and Lova supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts have said.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who has long been the governor of Lova, a major exporter of Chinese agricultural products, said that China has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, Branstad wrote in the op-ed des Moins Register, "China is now double-stacking us by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In order to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's glorious tradition of freedom of speech and expression to print paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in China's newspaper world you will hear a limited anti-soon, and you will not see a true reflection of the Chinese people's dissent on China's worrying economic flow, as the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
"One of China's leading newspapers eventually turned down an offer to publish its article," he added, though he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republican midterms are harassing women voters ahead of the election by defending Kavanaugh
While Brett Kavanaugh stands with and defends the Supreme Court nominee in several cases of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that the party will face resentment from women, especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding the subject have been extremely overwhelming, and most Republicans are already saying they want to move forward with a referendum.
In an article published in The Hill on Saturday by Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, he said that these things can no longer be taken back.
"I don't believe that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation could attract angry voters.
Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the progressive group Muvoon and national spokesman, told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday: "Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow, and they won't forget in November."
Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee pushed forward Kavanagh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, saying on Friday morning in the Senate's hallway that protesters said "November is coming!" as protesters said "November is coming!"
"Nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation has been a driving force.
People say that enthusiasm is already there; and it's true.
But it may be more swinging, especially among women voters in small towns and young voters between the ages of 18- to 29 years, when they don't like the president, they don't vote often."
Before giving details of the allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee in Ford's public testimony, analysts suggested that a reaction might occur if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News: "This has become a confusing conundrum for the GOP.
It's not just about the committee's view or final opinion on whether or not to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's about the way Republicans handled the entire issue and the way they've dealt with the complainant," Guy Cecil, director of Group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, following the agreement of Fords and Kavanagh, the American people can be divided somewhat by going further towards it.
The new poll found that 41 percent of respondents believed in or perhaps Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were definitely with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied, perhaps or certainly, during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reports that after pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez has alleged that the Supreme Court nominee had sexually harassed her at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
Google and Facebook are planning to launch a new website.
World Wide Web's inventor team is launching a startup to compete with Berners-Lee, Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt is the company that is building a solid to Berners-Lee open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information is allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind the invasion was "world domination."
We have to do it now, he said.
This is a historic moment.
This app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify and is available on a single browser and everywhere at the same time.
The unique thing in a personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which type of information to give access to.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, process, and the right skills to help Solid make it available to everyone.
Currently, the company has signed an agreement with some of the Bruce's staff developers and volunteer coders to work on the project, a security platform bought by IBM by Burns-Lee.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrip website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are "talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make complete changes to where all of their business models stand overnight."
We dont need their permission.
In a post published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the goal of Inrupt is "to provide professional energy and ecosystems to help secure the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, when the World Wide Web Consortium was established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Burns-Lee transformed the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after the launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm very optimistic for the next era of this web, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Celebrating the Victoria Cross Claric 1
The only church in England that won the Victoria Cross in World War I and celebrated its 100th year in the city.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the September 29, 1918, attack on the Bellanglais and Leh Court.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and no one knew then that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said he was a "bright symbol," declaring the monument to his grandfather's award-winning feat nearly 100 years later.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wayne led his battalion towards the Canal de Saint-Quentin between "excessive fog and heavy firing from field and machine guns."
He later reached the firing line and proceeded to run alone with a field-gun with "heavy bravery" and exited in three squads.
A month before the war ended, on October 4, 1918, Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's work was "something I know I can never do but it makes me something humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vane, also put a wreath after the parade, the parade was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added that "the support given by many is showing the bravery of a real hero."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Ballator 206, instead they got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you're spending the whole night watching Pack Balleter 206 to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's bill includes 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being shown live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., viewers in the U.K. rallied when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig, as Gagard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other.
Some of them woke up early in the morning and didn't know it was going to happen.
A fan on Twitter described the cartoon as a "sick joke."
Asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications, said: "The government rule is that for 6 p.m. that content was not appropriate so they had to go on children's programming.
Daddy's dog, yeah.
The company's chairman, Scott Koker, said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replays, I think we can probably do that," Cooker said.
It's Sunday morning and we can't do it this time and this time on Monday.
But we are working on it.
I mean, when the switch was over, a lot of writing went back and forth and it didn't seem to be all that smooth.
We tried to fix it and we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I promise you this will not happen again.
We usually do as many as five fights instead of six, and we tried to deliver more for the fans and we went from the top.
It's called a bad situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley Experiences 'Number' on Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he felt humiliated in front of everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he finally went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on First Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Lavren, he said he talked about gay rights being a "hope" for people.
He also said that being a parent pays less attention to winning the Olympics.
It has taken months for Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the Long-Running Show, to get sick.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first program, Daly said she felt "more lacking" in them because "it's not socially acceptable to pick up boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those who have experienced lower emotions than others and have experienced feelings of being different from others have actually given me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," so he didn't disappoint anyone when he learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and appealed to more countries to end homosexuality using her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he was speaking because he considers himself lucky to have found a way to live without compromises and that he wants to "encourage" others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he "suddenly caught me" in a 2013 interview.
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her, but she said there was never an issue of age difference.
When you go through so many good-luck occasions at such a young age - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later. He said that it is difficult to find someone who has had similar good-luck experiences.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and Daly said it changed only the "perfect perspective" of his life.
If you had asked me last year, 'I want to win a gold medal' was all that was.
You know what's bigger than the Olympic gold medal?
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011.
Daly said his father did not accept to die and finally said that if he still had tickets for London 2012 - he would want to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell them that you couldn't sit in a row wearing pajamas," he said.
I was sitting and holding his hand until he really stopped breathing. Dad died and I finally accepted that it was not invincible, he said.
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I learned that this is the dream of my life - there is no special feeling from diving in front of a crowd of domestic spectators at the Olympic Games.
He also deliberately selected his first song Heather Small's Proud Song, the song that worked to tie the samo at the Olympics and still thrills him.

Out-of-form Michaelson was sitting on a bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to regain form to avoid becoming an unhappy milestone.
Michaelson, who is going to play in the record 12th biennial event, was benched by captain Jim Furyck for Saturday's Foreballs and Forces.
Instead of being in the middle of an action, it is repeated for the United States, rather than being in the middle of a five-time major action he has repeatedly done for the United States.
The 48-year-old doesn't ideally fit for the tight-le golf national course when there aren't even fairly straight drivers at the peak of his career, where long rough grounds routinely serve a punishment of false shots.
And if the course itself isn't that tough, Michaelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, pairing up with Toky Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If Americans drop four points in 12 singles matches, Michaelson's match could prove to be quite crucial as the competition ends before it starts.
He was confident in his game and had nothing else to say.
"Furric said, 'He understands the role he plays today well, he slapped my back, he waved his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow.'
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been a big part of the team this week and he's been a big part of the team this week.
I didn't expect it to play two games.
I wanted to do more, but I thought we had to move forward as we could.
They want to be there just like everyone else."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record with the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can make the Ryder Cup career endings memorable that never match the height of his personal record.
Although Michaels has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven half-centuries at home, Furyk said his presence has infused some insurmountable power into the team.
He's funny, he's witty, he likes to make fun of people and he's a decent guy to be in the team room," he explained.
I think it's great to see the young players having fun with it, it was a pleasure to see it this week.
It's a lot more than just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead will break out whenever it takes place.
European captain Thomas Bejorne knows from experience that the gigantic lead up to the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a upset.
Dean began his career with a match at Valladera in 1997, where side captain Seve Ballesteros earned a five-point advance against the Americans, but the narrow gap reached the final line by saving the nose from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2- 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a heavy lead at Valladera; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won at Valladera, that too, only when, after watching the 2018 class, Bjorn said, both won 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all of our team that time is not running out.
You're going to have a sore throat tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
This will not be completed until the items are placed on the table.
Our goal is to try and win this trophy and that is where the focus is.
"I've told everyone, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but on the other hand, there are great players in the world that we know very well," he said.
Bourne adds that he is thrilled to see the way his players have performed on the tuff golf course: "I never put myself ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
There will be a personal exhibition tomorrow and that's a different matter to do.
When everything is going well with the partner, but when you have to show performance in person, your ability as a golfer is tested.
The only message you need to get to the players is that you have to give your best performance tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and give him your best on his own terms."
Against Bayern, rival Jim Furyk would expect a better performance personally than his partner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points, from the rest of the players, excluding him.
Furyk himself has tasted both a defeat-win, Europe having tasted "Miracle at Medinah" and was part of Brooklyn's winning team before he came out as a loser.
In 1999, when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had led his players in the last days, he said, "I remember every word of it."
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you've got to make a quick start, as you've seen in Medinah, in Brookline.
When the momentum is moving in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
Let's set up our line-up accordingly and put the players in a design that we think we can show some magic tomorrow."
Thomson has been tasked with advancing the game and facing Rory McLaren in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Raheem, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter facing other Europeans in the top half order.
"I went to this group in this order because I think it covers everything," said the second of the singles selection.
Germany's new war was re-introduced.
The German navy's newest frigate was due to be replaced by the Cold War-era Kalin warships in 2014, but due to faulty systems and high cost, it could not be delivered until next year, local media said.
A military spokesman said that the main ship of the new Baden-Wurtemberg-Class frigates of the "Reinland-Puffalz" brand has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the controversial post-delivery issue had sealed the fate of the ambitious project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class vessels to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to have features such as a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signage.
Another important feature is its long maintenance period - new frigates from home ports should be able to be put away for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that the cutting-edge warships must have been said to be able to show Germany's power abroad but they will get old when they come into service, Die Zeit notes.
The weak F-125 frigate became headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to approve the ship and sent it back to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the ship had been returned to the ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind sending the ship back, but the German media cited some important "software and hardware flaws" that render the warships sent on war missions useless.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wurttemberg-class warships would be powered by up to 120 sailor crews, only half of the manpower on the old Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, it has also come out that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Puffalz" is thought to be as heavy as the Age-Class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
The initial cost of the project is said to have increased from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problem of new frigates has become especially important in view of the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "going through a shortage of deployment-capable ships."
The official said that the issue was heating up over time, as the old ships were dismantled, but no Vessels were given.
He lamented that no one from the Freegate of Baden-Wurttemberg-class was able to join the Navy.
National Trust Evasdrops on Secret Life of Bets
The purpose of the new research conducted on real estate in the Scottish Highlands is to explore how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed a new light on the behavior of flying mammals and will help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will include common and soprano pipestrales in Wester Ross's invertebrate gardens, as well as brown long-eared and Dubenton bats.
Special records will be placed at the main locations around the property to track the activities of the bat throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile survey using hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the sounds of bats and what breeds are doing.
Then a living map and report will be prepared to make a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Daver, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help in determining the benefits such as the formation of grasslands and how best to preserve woodlands for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has seen a significant decline in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development works that damage their routes and habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, some chemical treatment of flypers and building materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
The shadows aren't really dark.
However, when it comes to catching prey due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a modern eco-location technique to point out errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens in the country and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Chamachidia very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect resting places and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve area in the Threeway Estate in Drumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal area for them.
We have developed a nice area for Chamachidiya at Thrive here," he said.
We've got old buildings, lots of old trees, and very good habitats.
But there's still a lot of stuff about that bat that's still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about how to move forward."
He emphasized the importance of verifying bats before carrying out maintenance in the property as the possible undesirable destruction of a single pregnancy could lead to the extinction of 400 females and young bats, possibly the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or annoy, or destroy their roost.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged people to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of its breeds, we don't even know how their population is growing."
Ronaldo rejected the claims of rape, along with a claim on the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape claims against him "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, alleging the magazine.
In a 2009 Las Vegas hotel room, Portugal and Juventus forward Ronaldo are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the claim was reported, addressing Ronaldo's 14.2 million fans in an Instagram live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
"All they've printed today is fake news," five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo said in front of the camera.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
And thats normal.
They want to make my name public, but that's part of the business.
"I'm happy and all is well," Rodriguez said.
Munjab lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, a report they have called "unfair reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy."
"The player will be compensated for the damage caused to the moral image consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years," said lawyer Christian Schertz.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After being found in a nightclub, according to papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by committing an act against the Creator.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knee after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good man" and only "one percent" a despot.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but it happened by mutual consent.
Mayorga has also claimed that she went to the police and she also took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to settle the court-out because she was "terrified" and "scared of being insulted in public."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she is constantly shocked by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged harassment, and this summer the Italian giants went to Juve in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK will "forever regret" losing its status as a carmaker
"If the UK loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, it will be ""forever regrettable"", Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "important" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernstone, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"Mr. Clark said, 'We need a deal.
Japan's car manufacturer has said that the impact of the no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Bernstone plant, which manufactures Toyota's Orris and Avensis, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production in our factory shut down," said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota at Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern over fears of leaving the EU, saying how the cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, leaving the EU without an agreement will work.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant a month after Brexit in Oxford.
In the case of no-deal Brexit, car manufacturers say the risk of a supply chain is a major concern.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis for car orders coming from both the UK and the European Union, and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, the border could be disrupted and, according to industry, it could lead to parts shortages and delays.
The company said that it is not possible to keep Toyota in its Derbyshire plant more than a day's worth of inventory, so the production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "definitely designed to avoid checks on the border."
"He told the BBC Radio 4's Today program, "We need a deal. We want to make the best deal, to accelerate this opportunity to 4 with success in the present.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers says that we need to be fully able to continue the hugely successful chain of supply chains.
It is not known how long the Toyota production will be shut down but with the prolonged production shutdown, he warned that the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately pose a risk to jobs.
Peter Sovellaris has worked in Bernstone for 24 years and is a Unit Union convenor at the plant, stating that the concern of its members is growing steadily: "My experience is that once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a specific and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, the White House says.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be "withdrawn for another week" as the dispute over Nomini Brett Kavanaugh continues in the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the relationship between the Trump supporter and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and so whether or not Mueller's freedom will be threatened, gossip has been running through the streets of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein wore a wire to record a conversation with Trump and discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rossenstein, however, denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, according to reports, he resigned.
Instead of meeting with Trump, it was announced on Thursday who would be in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "does not like" firing Rosenstein, but that the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which took both the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, with further delays in the Flower Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "Its date has not been fixed, it may be this week, I think there will be another week of backlog of everything that has been taken into consideration with regard to the Supreme Court."
But we'll see and I'll always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists have objected that Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Christina Aguilera explains why this is happening.
Sanders said the reason for not doing the briefings was not to "disappoint" TV reporters, adding that "I don't disagree with the fact that they're upset."
He then suggested that there should be a direct link between Trump and the press.
“She said the current president has had more Q&A sessions than any previous president. Further she added without giving evidence: “We know the numbers.”
Sanders said the briefing would still happen, but "if the press had the opportunity to ask a question directly to the President of the United States, it would be far better than talking to me."
We try to do that and we've done a lot in the last few weeks, you've seen and you can talk to the President of the United States when press briefings are held."
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or attending a press conference with visitors.
However, the press conference was held alone.
This week in New York, the president may have said why reporters assumed a strange situation before they gathered and behaved recklessly.
Health Secretary writes to EU employees in NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The health secretary wrote to the EU staff to express the country's gratitude to the staff working at the NHS in Scotland and wished they would remain post-Brexit.
Freeman MSP of GA sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the costs of implementing a permanent status for EU citizens employed in its dedicated public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman writes: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exiting were ongoing and this led to an expected decision by the autumn.
But the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a difficult time for all of us.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I attach great importance to the contribution of every member of the staff irrespective of their nationality.
Co-workers from all over the European Union have provided their valuable experience and expertise and have strengthened the work of healthcare and benefited the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Kristen Abercrombie underwent surgery immediately after a serious head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christine Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a serious head injury during Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
He fell to the ground and collapsed, he said.
The trainers and medical staff gave him abercrombie oxygen before putting him on the stretcher and took him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that the surgery was performed at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Abercrombie.
Harris added that "no details of the type or extent of the injury have yet been found" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
This is his first season with Tennessee State since Redshirt Sophomore Abercrombie's transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, with a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty to purchase the property to help the homeless with extra cash under the new toy plan using extra cash in the UK.
This move will adversely affect the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters
There will be an increase in stamp duty on people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects it will be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 crore a year in this way to help the homeless.
When buying property in the UK, foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty with additional cash used to help the homeless, which Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to target younger voters with more affordable housing and heavy-income earners.
Additional money to combat rough sleeping will be put in place to accelerate the government's campaign, with an increase in stamp duty on individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in the UK.
Surcharge - This is in addition to the current stamp duty, which may include the high level introduced on the sale of a second home and purchase two years ago and may be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London property is purchased by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because there are a large number of foreign buyers and they spend most of their time outside the country.
Boris Johnson has announced a new policy to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of overspending on the land to keep the property price high, and Theresa May urged to leave quotas on cheap homes to fix Britain's "Housing Disappearance."
Mr Corbyn has announced an unbroken series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and the emptying of "no-fault" possession.
It wants to give more power to the committee to build new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my Premiership to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we need to fix the broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unlikely that a hard-working UK resident would be as easy to buy a home as it is for individuals not living in the UK and working in foreign-based companies.
For many people, the dream of buying a house has become rare and sleeping in an unresponsive rented house is becoming a reality."
Jack Ross: "It's my last wish to run Scotland"
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says that his "final ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is grasping the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One, with three points from the top.
After leading St. Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership of the previous season, he disappeared from the stadium this summer.
I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B-cap," Ross told BBC Scotland's SportSound.
But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father as a child, and that's always kept me coming back.
If I succeed in the management of the club, I will get that opportunity."
Ross's predecessor as Sanderland manager includes Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he doesn't find it any bothersome to follow such established names in such a big club, having previously rejected proposals from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"If I can get this club back into the Premier League, can I get success at the moment?"
Due to the infrastructure and facilities in this club, it undoubtedly ranks in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get it, but only if I can get the club back there will I see myself successful here.
Ross has only been in his management career for three years, at Dumbarton he has worked 15 months as an assistant boss and a coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Aloe regain his three-tier reputation, and led St. Mirren to the championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he's felt more comfortable now than his career at Clyde, Hartalpull, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
And he said to Elijah, "It may be that he was a true life-circle."
I really believed that management was more appropriate for me than playing.
It seems odd because I've done the right thing, lived a decent life out of it, and enjoyed some decent goals.
But it can be difficult to play.
On a weekly basis, you have to see a lot of things.
I'm still going through that work pressure and load, but the management seems to be quite right.
I've always wanted to manage and now that I do it, it feels the most comfortable for myself throughout my entire life."

The exact time for pints is 5.30 pm on Saturday, according to the survey
Summer heatwaves have increased earnings for Britain's struggling pubs, but there has been more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups recorded a 2.7 per cent rise in sales in July, but in restaurants, their revenue fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of Business Consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "England's long participation in the heat of the sun and the expected participation in the World Cup continued the pattern of the previous month of June in July, with a 2.8% increase in pubs, while the restaurant suffered more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June was even worse in July.
The restaurant went down in sales as much as the drink-based pub and bar did the best trade.
Food-based pubs also suffered from heat loss, although they did not suffer as much as restaurant operators.
This means that people just want to go out for a drink.
"Drink sales in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while meal sales fell by three per cent."
Lesour and Hospitality Analyst RSM Paul Newman said: "These results are consistent with the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that despite the constant struggle of restaurant groups, the continued year-on-year decline of 4.8 percent will leave a much worse impact, especially on ongoing price pressures.
The long hot summer shouldn't be a bad time for the food industry and now the time will tell how much relief we will get from the moderate temperatures we are experiencing in August."
Total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including the new opening, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a slow decline in brand roll-outs.
The coffee pitch tracker for the UK's pub, bar and restaurant sector monitors industry sales and collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of 9 billion British pounds and is a benchmark for the established industry.

There is a growing fear in the news that content related to sex is being posted in it.
20% of students said they had a "major" account to show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has a private social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapidly growing "fake Insta" page - in reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
There is a growing fear in the news that content related to sex is being posted in it.
20% of students said they had a "major" account to show to parents while they also had a second private account.
One mother saw the mysterious site of her 13-year-old daughter fantasizing, in which the teenager requested the other "to rape" her.
Research by Headmasters of Digital Awareness UK and Independent Schools and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that, 40 percent of people between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of those having a private account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "While disturbing a lot of teens they find online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
On the Scottish athletics board will be Allied Doyle's "voice for athletes"
Allied Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body on the board of Scottish athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian BT has described the move as a great opportunity for guidance seekers to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Allied Scottish, UK and World Athletics have extensive respect in the community and we are sure that Scotland's Athletics will greatly benefit from them by bringing it on board.
"I look forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to Scotland and guide the sport," Doyle said.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, had four Olympic gold medals in total, and now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I had to face a stroke.
I couldnt walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will be able to recover to the extent that I will be able to recover.
It's been a long time since I've learned how to do it, how to do it, and how to do it today!
Thank you for the inspirational messages!"
There's a lot of information on the internet about the birth of a baby girl compared to the birth of a baby girl.
The breast pump company has shared an online opinion with the ad and compared it to cow's milk care from mothers.
In order to launch the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvy released a tung-in-cheek music video-inspired advert, expressing the mother's freedom to show off the new pump.
The four real mothers dance on a track in a village surrounded by cows on the street and sing the songs: "Yes, I give milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "Yes, you probably don't see freckles, that's my breast."
The chorus goes on: "Pump her, pump her, I'm feeding her children, pump her, pump her, I'm suckling my women's milk."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it highlights the "terribleness" of the dairy industry.
There has been a lot of wrong decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"For as it is written, 'They shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Jesus, but they shall not see him.'
Elvi breast pump sits perfectly fit inside the nursing bra (Elvi/Mother).
Another commented: "This is extremely traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why don't they use their mothers to keep their children from using breast pumps?"
Another added: "This is an out-of-touch advertisement."
Another defends the ad, a woman admits that she felt the song "Hellerius."
I think this is a genetic code.
If I had to pay for it, I'd still need it.
I feel like I'm a little bit like a pig.
This is a bit of a crazy advertisement, but I see what it is.
"It's a genetic product," he wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at moms who pump up (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like cows.”
This is not an advertisement praising or valuing the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that they were all dancing with a discreet pump placed in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the understanding that many women who have pumped breast say they feel like cows.
Although the Elvi pump is fairly silent, it has no wires or tubes and sits a bare fit inside a nursing bra that gives women the freedom to roam, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Banarine commented: "Elvi pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and aggressive launch.
By drawing parallels between expressing women and dairy cows, we want to put breast pumping and all of its challenges among the people in the light, and by showing it fun and unflinchingly, this new pump comes with a wonderful sense of liberation.
This is not the first time that Ellie has become a head coach.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children, using the product, made a catwalk for designer Martha Jacubowski.
Hundreds of displaced children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the number of detained migrant children has increased, the proportion of monthly border crossings has not changed, as the harsh tussles and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves are non-documentary immigrants and they fear for their ability to live in the country by moving forward to claim those children.
In June, federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration officials, raising the risk with the announcement.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confessed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the sponsorship of numerous civilians.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of sponsors or members of the household live in the country illegally, and most of them have criminal affiliations.
So we continue to press the steps of those individuals," Albanese said.
In order for the children to act more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, which, according to earlier Shelter Workers, was 60 days.
Many immigration judges will get to request their case for legal status, via a video conference call instead of an individual.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief will be disposed of expeditiously.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be anxious or depressed, which may result in violent clashes or escape attempts, according to reports originating from Shelter Workers and the recent month's system.
Lawyers said concerns have increased in a larger facility such as Torniello, where they are more likely to be ignored due to the number of children.
They added that moving to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare the children emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can shock many people who are already struggling.
Syria asked the U.S., French, and Turkish to withdraw 'capture forces' immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly after eight years of war, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulem also called for the return of Syrian refugees.
Moulaym, who also served as deputy prime minister, said the foreign military was illegally occupying Syrian territory under the counter-terrorism advocacy and that "equivalent justice will be done to him."
He must go back immediately and without any conditions, he told the assembly.
Maulem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, which has killed more than 360,000 people since 2011 and displaced millions from their homeland.
"We will continue to fight this war until we have cleared all areas of Syria," he said, "for the foreign presence of both terrorist organizations and of any illegal aliens."
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, both training and advising Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the refugee problem, Moullem said the conditions were good for them to return, and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that forced the refugees to flee.
We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
They are politicizing what should be purely a human problem.
The United Nations and the European Union have warned that reconstruction assistance for Syria will not be provided until there is a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say an agreement to set up a buffer zone in one of the last strongholds of the recent Idlib rebels between Russia and Turkey has created an opportunity to push forward political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish transaction halted a major potential attack on a province by Syria's Russian-cooperative forces, where three million people live.
Moullem, however, stressed that there were "clear deadlines" specified in the agreement and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eliminated."
UN envoy Staffon de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Maulem set out the conditions for participation in the Syrian government's committee, which said the row work should be limited enough to "review the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why do you think Trump won a second term?
By that logic, Mr. Trump will be able to win re-election in 2020, unless the scandals and scandals end sooner than you realize the presidency, which many liberals are presumably hoping for.
There is no doubt that "there will be a dramatic finale of the presidential election that never happened!"
As of now, there are no signs of the viewer's stagnation.
Since 2014, the president-time rating has more than doubled from 1.05 million in CNN and nearly 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the focus news's major time viewers are on average 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Meadow Show" has gained prominence in cable ratings with nearly 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neil Bair, who runs the ABC drama's "Defeated Drama" show, which is about a Cabinet Secretary who becomes president after the devastating attack on the House of Representatives.

The money comes in the pockets of the mid-term elections.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is witnessing a flood of wealth, thanks to the rebuilding of congressional districts that put two postgrads in the doldrums of a single seat.
These recently remodeled suburbs lead the Pittsburgh District Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Keith Rothfuss of the Republic, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, strongly entrenched with the new 17.
Maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's January decision that the old districts were run secularly in favor of the Republicans.
The competition, which will be held in the new 17th, has touched the campaign finance slugfest between the main party's financial geographies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania, winning a narrow margin in a wide-ranging special election in March.
That seat retained a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a little more edge.
The U.S. insisted on fines to El Salvador for cooperating with China, then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a thud retreat from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June and had a hotel in Panama until partners ousted the Trump Organization's 2017 governing party.
State department officials said in a statement earlier this month that they had decided to withdraw the presidents of U.S. diplomatic campaigns due to "current decisions not to recognize Taiwan any longer" from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama.
But the idea of the penalty came only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including drug control, development and economic cooperation.
The proposed penalties, which included deductions on financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings moved forward, North American and Central American officials pushed back a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was similar to last year's meeting that was seen as a step towards efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top management officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to move forward, effectively ending any idea of penalties for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the summit, which will be held in mid-October to gather the administration in the import signal.
And three U.S. ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to give a statement on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
His accounts were endorsed by an outside analyst who was close to the management and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The shoes could then be put on the report of special counsel Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's potential obstructions on justice, which is now very convincing evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller is also trying to find out if Mr Trump's campaign was affected by the attacks on the Russian presidential election.
Whether Congress should change hands, Mr. Trump will see himself facing responsibility in that system, as he prepares to go back against a panchayat of voters and perhaps even his colleagues at the end.
That's a lot of possibilities, and I don't mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fallacy is inevitable - that he doesn't even have a chance in Europe.
We have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, only if the West had stopped it and backed the Zakoslovaks in Munich.

The direction of history's foundations around these divergent points, and the ugliness of democracy, is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing some of these divergent points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Law Officer Rod Rosenstein, who is the person who controls the future of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been plagued with problems ever since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his health for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' account is inaccurate.
How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's new request is not complete or uniform - or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will last for a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the teachings I learned in Prague.

Regina's Graham Dorns is optimistic ahead of the race against Rapide Vienna
Rangers became hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that following an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the victory against Austria will put them in a strong position to qualify for the G category of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dornes from making the first appearance until the season drew 2-2 with Villarreal but they believe Rangers could use that result as a springboard for even greater things.
It was a good point for us because Villariel is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We thought we could get something in the game and come up with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the close of the end, but a draw might have been a good result.
They were probably good in the first half and we came in the second half and were on the good side.
It's another big European night on a Thursday.
"Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game but, with the backing of the crowd with us, I am sure we will be able to go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with all the changes made to my injuries and the club itself, too, a factor that feels good for the space now.
The group is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we'll be able to move forward now, put the weather behind us and succeed."
Women are losing sleep because of the fear of retirement.
Despite having an idea of how they want to care for those who participated in the survey, some people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in a national-level study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to communicate," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance business at Nationwide.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't know your wishes ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important component in determining costs.
Bring Your Financial Advisor In: Your advisor may also be able to help you out with a way to pay for the costs incurred.
Your fund choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance plan, a cash-value mix to cover these expenses, or a self-insurance plan with your own assets as long as you have money.
Get rid of your legal documents and get rid of the legal battles quickly.
Get a health care substitute so that you can monitor your medical care and in case you're not able to tell, the professionals can hire a trusted person to ensure that your wishes are followed.
Also, keep in mind to have a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
You'll choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid off if you're unable to.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are having a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies?
Write down these details as a written plan so that you are prepared.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the communication blockade, the relief authorities could not get any information from the Donggala region north of Palu, which is located near the earthquake centre of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu A, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, is the capital of the central Sulawesi province at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a coastal region of the island of Sulawesi, more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) in length.
The territory, an administered territory that is below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agencies, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people living along the coastal line of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom lived in Asean.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Behind the Sumatra coast, several hundred died on the island of Nieuws.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, giving rise to a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: Behind Sumatra, a 7.5-magnitude tsunami struck one of the Mantawai Islands, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed the lives of nearly 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake strikes the P.D. Jaya Territory of Aseya, which caused damage and devastation as people remember the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami disaster.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sara Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sara Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State troops, Palin, 29, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, on the grounds of interfering with a report of domestic violence and creating obstructions in arrest.
According to the police report, when a female colleague tried to call the police to report the crime, she took her phone from her.
Palin's Met-Su trial is being questioned at an earlier facility and held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he himself declared "certainly not guilty" when he asked his plea, the network noted.
Palin is facing three Class A offenses, which means she could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B offence, which carries a jail sentence of one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Experience Court.
He was charged in January 2016 with domestic assault, a domestic violence crime report, and possessing a weapon linked to the incident in a drunken state.
His girlfriend had alleged that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans after linking her son's hissing behavior with PTSD, which has since been subjugated from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake: Hundreds of people have been killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have come to a standstill and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake has just hit the back of central Sulawesi, which is located in the heart of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
The video is going viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand the rare death penalty for the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Safoulo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has never been awarded in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30A, allegedly used a home depot tenanted truck to attack a bike rickshaw along the western side highway in low-lying Manhattan, so that pedestrians and cyclists on its way to Oct.
Filled in the southern district of New York, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipove "willfully" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document it makes a probable provision for the death penalty for both reasons.
Weeks after the attack, a federal maha panchayat reprimanded Saipov with a 22-count charge that included eight charges of murder with fraud, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime lawsuits, and one charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preconceived notions," the lawyers said, describing how Saipov behaved in a "disgusting, cruel and demeaning" manner.
The notice of intent states, "The families and friends of Saifoulo Habibullevic Saipove Digo Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Klavis, Ann Laurie Dicutt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mondeza and Alejandro Damien P<0xC3><0xA1>ncho, the victims and the victims of the injury."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has spent nearly a decade prosecuting a death penalty lawsuit.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted and sentenced for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during a Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A resident of Saipov, Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good for what he had done, the police said.
According to the affidavit, Saipove told officials that he was inspired to attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-year-old charges.
One of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, David Patton, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that seeking a death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence in prison without any possibility of escape would only prolong the trauma of these events for each of those involved," Patton said.
The defence force of Saipov had earlier asked the lawyers not to demand the death penalty.
According to the report, the NDP needs to be a leader in the fight against corruption.
During a protest at the Tory Convention, today, Nigel Farage took an oath to gather the army of the people.
The former U.K. leader said politicians had a "warming experience" from Eurosceptics as one of the MPs in Theresa May suggested she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boone of the conservative back-and-forth said in March in Birmingham that if Mr. Ferrez had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have "gone out" by now.
But the challenge that Mrs. May is facing to regain her deeply divided position has been underlined by the pro-remaining Tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The president is struggling to maintain a plan to reconcile his checkers between Brexiteers, reminders, and EU attacks.
The Allies asserted that despite the intense negative reaction, she would go ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels - and force Euroskeptics and Labour to make a choice between her aid and 'anarchism'.
Mr. Boone said that leave the rally in Solihal so that he wanted the cheques to be thrown away.
You suggested that Mr. Ferrez should be made an ally and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If they had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will support the break-even, but we need to remove the checkers.’
Establishing his own opposition to the EU, he said: We did not fight to keep the world wars going.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the 2016 poll as a change of opinion, saying: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to live is totally wrong.
Andrea Jenkins, with a tory breakout, was also present in March, telling reporters: I say simple: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Checkers are not famous in the general public, opponents are not going to vote for them, they are unpopular in our group and our workers who actually work in the streets and help us get elected in the first place.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please
In a pointed message to Smt. May, she added: 'Prime Ministers save their jobs when they keep your promises.
Mr. Ferrez said the rally politicians should do what they can to experience the heat if they are to be tricked into a 2016 referendum decision.
"This is a matter of trust between our people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to deceive Brexit and we're going to tell them today that 'we won't leave you after you've done that.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic mob, he said: I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying the Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are organizing an army of the people of this country who gave us victory in the Brexit and we will not bow down until we become an independent, self-governing, sovereign United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the survivors marched across Birmingham before placing a two-hour procession in the city centre.
At the end of the week, a group of activists stormed the banners of the Brexit Against Torres.
Labour ally Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives with a party app for the security issues they were troubled by as soon as the convention opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can keep the systems in the right place and all the technologies for Canada Plus plus so that there is a non-conflict border, so that there is free trade in Ireland without borders," he added.

"There's nothing quite like a good haircut," he added.
Warren plans to take a tough look at the president's dot
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will take a "hard look at President Mattney Dot" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat talked about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, GOP State Representative Geoff Dil, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign, is running for re-election against him in November.
She may have been at the center of speculation about going against Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event was Trump's 36th meeting with elements using his townhall format after he took office on Saturday afternoon in the Holyoke.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was now "time for women to go to Washington to see our broken government, and it covers the matter of a woman staying on top."
Man shot to death by LSU's Sims
Police in Batten Row, La., announced Saturday that a suspect in the death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 11 a.m. Diane Simpson, 20, at the ET news conference.
He released a video asking for help identifying a man he saw in the footage on Friday.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near South University Patan early on Friday.
A bullet wound to the head and eventually resulted in his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, per 247 sports.
Wade came to the rescue of his friend and Simpson was hit by a bullet.
Simson was asked and he confessed to being on the scene, being armed, and Wade confessed to shooting Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 little one who grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in Sims 32 games with 10 stars in the Vettel season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title with a win against Sebastian Vettel by team's orders
It became clear for the moment when the Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the team would play a big part in the Mangavale A Mercedes race.
From Paul, Botas got off to a good start and almost hung out to dry Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his group mate.
Vettel had previously moved to Pitts and left Hamilton in traffic in the amount of tail, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes then pitted a lap and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action of the wheel from several wheels that saw a Ferrari driver happily leave the insides of the rear free from the risk of being caught after a double-walk to defend at the third angle.
Max Verstappen started with the back row of the grid on his 21st birthday and came seventh at the end of the first circle.
He then relied on his tyres for the quarter, so that a quick end goal would go beyond Sadhy and Kimi Raikonnen, thus leading a large part of the race.
In the 44th circle it finally came to the pits, but was unable to increase its speed in the remaining eight circles as Raicon took fourth.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did an excellent job over the weekend and I was told by a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a couple," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein's letter to the Supreme Court accusing her of sexual harassment, urging her not to violate Christine Blasey Ford's letter.
Speaking in a procession in West Virginia, the president did not directly comment on the testimony given by Ford ahead of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "selfish and bad and untrue."
One thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the past few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and selfish and bad and untruthful," he said.
When you see the lights and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that."
I didn't do this."
Do you remember?
"Dude, did you get the flu shot?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, where?"
Oh, no.
I didn't lock up."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, we linked it to the influence of the senator.
Finstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in late July, and it leaked in early September - but Finstein denied that the leak did not take place from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak them, I told Finstein to the committee, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she told me."
But she didn't see any rejection to sit down with the president, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "What I'm telling you was an extremely bad body language."
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Advancing the defence of the Supreme Court's response to allegations of sexual misconduct by three women, the President indicated that the Democrats were using the charges for themselves.
They are determined to regain the necessary power in any way.
You can see selfishness, arrogance, they don't care who's hurting them, they have to run to get power and control," he wrote.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars struck back in Dandi on Friday to win 5-3 to make up for the Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants.
The Giants got a two-goal boost early on from the attack of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Blvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Counni restored the lead of the Dwyer Giants before bringing home the side level.
Lucas Lundwald Nelson scored two goals to ensure his victory before Francois Bouchard equalised with a stick.
Adam Keyfaceman lost in the third Elite League of this season to Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the parties, in which the Giants won the last three matches.
Dwyer's opener came with the help of Kendall McFaul at 3:35 in the fourth minute, with David Roarford providing assistance as Bluevilleer doubled the lead after four minutes.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan took home the game at 13:10 before becoming a provider for Matt Marquart Covey's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that when he scored his second goal at the end of the first night, the Giants took the lead in the first break.
The home side regrouped and Buchhardt once again put him in the level term with a powerplay goal at 27:37.
At the end of the second session of the first match, Colin and Charles Corcore jointly assisted Nelson to give Dundee a lead and ensured him a victory in his team's fifth halfway in the final session.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are in their next match at Milton Keynes' home on Friday.
Thousands of people have been evacuated from the burning building to avoid flooding
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero because after his death it was determined that he had a plane loaded with thousands of people taken off the ground safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, prompting a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks can destroy the area and many Palu-towns are trapped under the slums.
After his aides escaped, 21-year-old Antonius Gunwan Agung left his post in the Dolta control tower at Mutiara Ciss al-Jufri air base in Palu.
This was to ensure that the BAtic Air flight 6321 on the runway could safely take off.
When he saw that the control tower was broken, he jumped from there.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia said that Johannes Sirit said the decision could save thousands of lives, according to ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter to take Kalimantan's baby girl to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before we were able to get to Palu from the helicopter.
"When we hear about it, our heart breaks," he said.
Meanwhile, officials feared the death toll could rise to tens of thousands, speaking with the country's disaster innovation agency, saying the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong were out of reach.
The agency's spokesman, Sutopo Puro Nugraho, said, "While many people have not been reached, it is believed that many people are still buried under the rubble."
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, with a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.

Micronesia plane crash: Air Niyugini now says one person is missing after a lagoon plane crash
It crashed in Micronesia, a single-line operated flight in the Pacific Lagoon, now showing that one person was missing, when it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely exported from the sinking plane.
In a statement, the airline said that the account was unavailable for the male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
In an attempt to land at the Chuyak Island airport, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane's water splashed down.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
The cause of the accident is not known and the exact cause of the accident is yet to be ascertained.
Both the airlines and the US Navy said that the aircraft landed in the legoon short of the runway.
Some observers thought the plane would overshoot the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jens said the plane went down.
"It's a good thing," Jones said.
Jens said A and others managed to escape by crossing the waist for emergency exports on a sinking plane.
The flight attendants were screaming and shouting, and they also suffered minor injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that before the aircraft sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water, the sailors who had repaired the nearby coast also assisted in the rescue by using inflatable boats to rescue the people.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in a PNG-registered airline crash in the past two decades, but it does not have an air niuge.

U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett specializes in the field of Khufia analysis.
He mentioned before the jury how he used his cellphone records to combine a piece of the activities of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, who died the night she died.
Rolett said he received location data from several cellphones, which contradicted his earlier claim that Telis was with him on the evening of Chamber's death.
When the data showed that his cellphone was with Chambers, he told her that at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked if he was in the truck with Sanford that night, Telis was telling the truth, he said, "He's lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another incompatible Hutty K. Teles said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone record indicated that the couple had known each other for a week.
Rollett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles removed the camera's text, call, and contact information from his phone.
She's ruined her life," he said.
The final arguments are scheduled to be heard on Sunday.
The judge said he hopes to take the indictment to court later that day.

There's another black man.

After receiving inappropriate criticism that "she was another black man," the mother complained, divulging a New York couple's discriminatory dismissal from their jobs.
The couple denied being their own narcissist, comparing the claim to a "recovery of money."
Lizzie Plasco-Flexman, who was the mother of two children, was disappointed to learn that the new childcare provider, Giesel Morris, was blackmailed on the first day of her work in 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ONOTHER BLACKPERSON, such as Mrs Plasco-Flexman, who gave praise to her husband.
However, she sent Kumari Morris twice instead of sending her husband.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her omission, an "unacceptable" Plasco-Phelaxman fired Mrs. Morris by saying that she was a current Nenny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting Filipinos to replace her.
Ms. Morris was given a bhuttan for a day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is filing an indictment for indemnity to dismiss the couple, and is seeking indemnity of $350 per day for six months, initially hired her for residential work, but without a restraining order.
I want to show you that, look, you can't do that," she told the post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
Responding to claims that the couple are racist, he said it was appropriate to terminate Morris's employment, fearing he could not trust him after being insulted.
My wife sent her something that she didn't intend to say.
She is not anti-Semitism.
"We're not anti-Semitism," the president, Joel Plasko, told the Post.
But can you put your child in the hands of someone you thought was wrong, even if he was mistaken?
"Your new baby?
Let it go."
Comparing the indictment to a "money recovery," Plasco said that his wife had months left to have a child and she was in a very difficult time."
You're following someone, aren't you?
"It's not a good thing," the bank said.
Although the legal process is still going on, the public's court has responded promptly to the couple's condemnation of taxes on social media, blaming their behavior and reasoning.
Peddington's publishers were afraid that the reader wouldn't associate with a talking bear, the new letter was published.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to keep a first-time reader in place of a second before publishing.
We now know that this is a huge success."
She says her father, who was inspired to write a children's book with a small toy bear, previously worked as a cameraman for the BBC, was ironic about abandoning his work, telling her that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bittersweet," followed by his death last year.
Peddington, whom he describes as "an important member of his family," said his father was proud of his potential success.
"He was a very quiet person, and he was not a self-confessed person," she said.
But because Paddington wasn't very real to him, it was like if you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of it, even if it's not actually doing your job.
I think he saw the success of Peddington that way.
This was his own creation and imagination, but he always credited Peddington with it."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon disembarking her daughter, she was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to show her life.
Ned was always calling to say that this was really bad, because he didn't expect it to succeed, Mrs. Eden-Leperosay said.
Then I got a call from Ned that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tess.
You're going to be in the thick of it with you.
I will be with you.
The doctors gave her medicines for pumping her heart, which was slowly losing effect and leaving her system.
She died a few days ago and all of this was gone.
All I knew was that I had to sit there and wait for it.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I really had to take care of it."
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Lepperhouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - unaware of the mental anguish she was enduring.
No one knew, she said.
My heart was pounding and I was on the edge of my seat all the time.
It was hard to understand, but it was on the flight, I felt this heavy sense of empathy for Ned.
He was the source of my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Victims hold post-cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting an inspirational message and phone number on the Welt Bridge, on which people can make calls to seek help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old, from which she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, told her that her son had an optimistic smile.
Everyone knew him by his wits.
He always said that his memory would brighten up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler's brother, the suicide bomber, was looking for his brother.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a handbook on impact."
Mrs. Davis wrote the card, "To show people that there are a lot of people they can go to and talk to", even if they are just friends.
"Don't sit down, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been the benefactor of Mrs. Davis for years, said that shortly after Mark's mother's death, she lost her 15-year-old colleague Mark.
She never said she felt sad or sad or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his nature.
On Christmas Day, he was very upset - when the children opened their gifts, he saw nothing in front of you or anything."
Her death was a big shock to her, but she has to work on it: "This makes a hole in the family.
This is what separates us.
But we all have to keep fighting."

As soon as the FBI began the investigation, the future of Kavanaugh was inexorably hanging in the balance.
"I thought we could actually get what we wanted - a search-limited time, a limited scope of work - maybe we could bring a little unity," she said Saturday, expressing her apprehension that the committee was "falling" into a biased gridlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters like the FBI investigation?
They want it because of their time.
The midterm election is just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as is expected, the Republican performs poorly, he will falter in his attempt to elect a man of his own free will to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was calling the Senators, he was lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who served at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s private secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate will have a Vogue, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will ensure Mike Pence breaks the tie and becomes the Vice-Chairman for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "reduced" under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Referring to figures from the South's Ministry of Integration, Park Byong-Sage said there were 1,127 refugees in the previous year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the harsh border control between North Korea and China and the acceptance of high tariffs by people traffickers was the main reason.
There has been no official statement from Pyongyang.
A large number of refugees from the north are finally presented with South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The largest migration took place through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easy to cross between the two Koreas in the demilitarization zone (DMZ) high defense.
The Chinese take refugees as illegal immigrants who are not accepted as refugees, and repeatedly send them back forcefully.
Relations between the North and South - which are still technically at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries held a meeting in Pyongyang to discuss the nuclear issue.
The summit comes after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore in June when they agreed to work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for undermining progress.
In a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Ri said, "The United States will not believe in our national security without any trust, and in such situations, there is no way we can disarm ourselves before unilaterally."
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "Histeriic," saying he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "hostile" judge of the Supreme Court and said he was unfit for the nature of self-isolation in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks at an inauguration at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had ever performed in such a way, she would have said "Historical," Pelosi said on Thursday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony.
Kavanaugh emotionally refuted the allegations that he had been sexually assaulted by Dr. Kristin Blasley Ford while both of them were in a coma.
Talking about his family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional at the time of his initial bout, often speaking out loud and squeezing his throat.
He condemned the Democrats in a committee that explicitly accused them of "violent and coordinated character assassinations" organised by liberals, which led to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves she is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because it clearly shows she is biased against the Democrat.
"I think he's got himself disqualified, out of the bayonet and style in which he went after Clinton and the Democrat," she said.
Will she try to impeach Kavanaugh, if this is confirmed, and if the Democrats succeed in gaining a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi expressed doubt over the question.
"I will do this - if it's not showing the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not worth living in the courtroom, not just in the Supreme Court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the appropriate attention act or potential bias against Roe v. Wade as it comes to an orthodox justice human being.
During the hearing of his confirmation, Kavanaugh ignored the question as to whether he would be able to digest certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for the hysterical, partisans to go to court, and Amara is expected to say that this is not going to go very well," Pelosi said.
Women need to do this.
It's been months and years since she was diagnosed with depression that she couldn't get out of the house without it.
"When we're angry, we cry," Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
I don't think this is unusual, do you think?
She went on to say, "I was very helped by a woman, who was an employee somewhere, who told Jan that she was crying, when she got angry but developed a technique, which meant that when she started crying, she would say to the person in front of her, who was talking to her, "You think I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm in a rage."
And she's just moving forward.
And I think that was wise."
Tears are allowed in the form of exports as part of anger, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job in a male-prime minister's office, where once I saw myself crying with irresistible rage, was that I was caught by a woman's tickling of my neck - a stabbing manager, from whom I was always a little scared - who dragged me on a ladder.
Don't ever let them see you cry, she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
"You think you're happy, and you're happy because you're happy."
Patricka Schroeder, who was the president of a Democratic Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a matrimonial relationship on a boat called Monkey Business, and when he was thrown out of the competition, Mrs. Shroder was very disappointed and felt that she should not consider running for president herself, there was no reason behind it.
Thirty years later, she smiles and says, "It wasn't a well-planned decision."
"There were already seven contestants in the competition and the last thing they wanted was another.
Some called it the "snow white and the service dwarves."
Because the campaign was doomed, she was behind collecting the money, and that's why she swore that she wouldn't participate in the contest until she collected $2 million.
This was a losing battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, to whom the men gave $1,000, would give her only $250.
Did they think I was exempt? She was surprised.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run a formal campaign, she got out of the moods - thanks to the people who supported her, the frustration with the system, which made it harder to collect money, and the anger at voter targeting and gender discrimination in place of delegates - there she got caught.
"You'd have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to them.
You may have noticed that my husband was a professional photographer.
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my grave.
Is she crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war may be appropriate for Beijing
Experts believe that the early period of the trade war between the United States and China has been terrible, and long-term benefits for Beijing could increase until the war is over.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump issued the first warning about tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week came with an innovative tariff, with a tax of half of the face on all goods entering the United States from China affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods.
Each time Beijing retaliated, it imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to play the US short-for-short, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to budge.
To return to Washington means leaning against China, but publicly leaning against the U.S. would be extremely embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing moves in the right direction, the pressure of the U.S. trade war can positively support China in the long run by reducing the gap between the two economies.
"The fact that Washington or Beijing made an immediate political decision could create conditions that would trigger an economic telespin, or even actually worse than what the country's previous audience saw," said Abigail Grays, a research associate at the Center for New American Security, who focuses on Asia for the think tank.
Syria is ready to send refugees back, says External Affairs Minister
Syria says it is willing to return refugees voluntarily, and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem said the situation in the country was improving.
He said that today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe to move forward in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the conditions now exist for the voluntary return of the refugees in the country, which they had to give up because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alim said the Syrian government would welcome assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or co-operation from countries that sponsor extremism.
Europe's victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating Team America by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on the European axis and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the toss, as Denmark's captain Thomas Bourne's tin reached 14.5 points, his need to defeat the United Nations.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for the greater part of the tournament, dipped his t-shirt in water in the 16th hole par-3 and won his match at Francesco Molinari.
After the introduction of the current format of the tournament in 1979, italki golfer Molinari achieved a shine in all his travels, with 1 to 4 players leading 5-0.
The lowest-ranked player in the U.S. Jordan Spieth European team was blown away 5&4 by Denmark's Thorbourne Oles.
The world's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 off England's Ian Potter, who may have played in his final Rider Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European winner with 25.5 career points in the tournament.
I don't usually cry, but I'm alive today.
This is going to be a tough year.
I would like to thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
With the European win, Bhavuk Garcia said, "This is about the team and I am happy that I was able to help.
He takes a torch to his native John Ram, who defeated the legendary Tiger Woods 2&1 of U.S. golf in the singles game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
In France, Woods lost all four of his matches and now has a 13-21-3 career rider cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, came second after Jack Nicholson.
Team USA has struggled to get fairways throughout the week with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf in the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyck said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, these people fought.
This morning we had a little bit of a trip to Europe.
We have fought.
Thomas is greeted.
This is the best captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will all be together once again, I will work with the PGA of America and our rider cup committee and we will move forward.
I am very proud of these 12 players and proud to have served as captain.
You've got to put your hat on top of your head.
We got out."
