Welsh Assembly members worried about ‘mappets’ themselves
A number of members of the House of Representatives are working to change their positions to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this fear is the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Wesh Parliament.
Members of various political parties are afraid to face the irony of the name change.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party was concerned that the new designation "matches the rhythm with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Welsh: In Welsh, Twp means fool and Pwp means mall.
A Plaid Assembly member said they were "not happy" as a team and suggested an alternative.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was looking at the name change as "open-minded" but noted that there was little pronunciation difference between the MWP and the MAP.
In this sense, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the pronunciation of the English letter U in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the provisions for initiating the name change process, said: “Members must make the final decision as to what will be the details of the designation of the members of the Assembly.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change their names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public vote in which the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament received widespread support.
Regarding the designation of Assembly members, the Commission is supporting the Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP has received the most support in the general public.
Apparently, the Assembly members are suggesting different options, but it will be difficult for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, to reach a consensus, whose draft of the legislation is due to be submitted within a few weeks.
This provision of reforms will have various changes regarding the functioning of the Assembly, including the disqualification of the members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
After the debate on this provision, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to cast a final vote on what their post should be.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote is designed to avoid decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor's name is a symbol of its claim to the region and has repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Giorz Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, believe that the change of name is only a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's fruit bells are ringing in Harlem.
"The older people I spoke to said that historically there was a church and a bar at every corner," Mr Adams said.
"There's none of that today."
He said that it is important to understand that the silhouette is missing.
Nowadays, people use social media in different ways.
"The toilets are no longer the sitting room of the area where everyone goes on a regular basis."
In the case of the church, he is worried that the money that sold the property, the leaders will not last as long as they think, “and today and tomorrow, they will go back to where they started.”
He also said that apartment buildings and condominiums could be built on the site of the church where people would live who would not help the rest of the churches in the area.
“The majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so they will accelerate the day these churches close because most of the people who come to this condominium are less likely to be members of the church.”
Before Harlem became a black-dominated metropolis, both churches were established by the White Congregation – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist Church left the church in 1930.
A black congregation in a nearby synagogue took ownership of the building.
Reverend John Howard took over St. Martins, a black congregation under Johnson, who led a boycott against retailers on A Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street for refusing to provide jobs and promotions for black workers – which is a major road to shopping in Harlem.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to restore it, they arranged to build the carillon.
David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called Carillon "the poor man's bell."
The expert who played Carillon last July called it something different: “a historical asset” and “unprecedented historical musical.”
The expert, Tiffany Nyong of the University of Michigan, also said that it is the world's first carillon served by a black player, played by Donnieo A. Lind, who was hired 18 years ago to play a larger carillon of the Riverside Church.
St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complex incident of architects and contractors who are appointed by the general leaders of the church or by the Episcopal Diocese.
Vestry – the governing body of the parish, which consists of general leaders – voiced their concern in July that they thought the Diocese would “slowly transfer costs” to Vestry, although Vestry was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some members of the parish have complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the Diocese.
A 13-year-old man has been injured in a shark attack after drowning in California.
A 13-year-old boy has been injured in a shark attack after he sank to catch a Galda shrimp on the first day of the Galda shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. on Beacons Beach, near Cincinnati.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he heard the boy screaming for help when he was about to drown with friends on Saturday morning.
Hamel said that at first he thought the boy was barking to the delight of catching a twig, but then "could understand that the boy was screaming, 'Shoot me!'"
“It bites me!”
"His voice was broken," said Hamel, who could see the boy approaching.
“I scream out to everyone to get up from the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to the Rapide Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The shark species has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said a shark appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but it was identified as not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his leg.
Officials have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Cincinnati for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
There are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Sensebris plans to enter the UK market
Sensoris Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams are going to be competing in the store business, including retail stores, crafted with artifacts like department stores, and expert support staff.
As part of a strong effort to enter the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion bullion market, these large bullion islands will be launched in 11 stores nationwide and will be rolled out in other stores if proven successful. The UK bullion market is growing where the market for fashion and home decor essentials has fallen.
This investment in morphology is coming as supermarkets are once again looking for new ways to fill shelves filled with TVs, microwaves, and home furnishings.
Sensebris said it would double its morphological content to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Tweezerman and Dr. Poe, for the first time.
The already existing cosmetics ranges like L'Oreal, Mebelin and Burt's Biz will have more space, which will have separate spaces for brands such as boutiques.
The supermarket is launching its boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan friendly – which has become very popular among young buyers.
As well as, perfume seller The Fragrance Shop will run product delivery tests at two Sensebris stores, the first of which was launched last week in Crichton, South London, and the second later this year at Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping online and buying small quantities of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets are having to put in extra effort for buyer gathering.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sensbaris, said the outlets will look like department stores as the supermarket chain is competing with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, and that it will have more services and non-food products.
Sensebris has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores since buying Argos and Habitats chains two years ago, and has also opened a number of habitats, which have increased sales of groceries and made the acquisition more profitable, the company claims.
The previous attempt to manipulate the supermarket and to decorate the pharmacy department has failed.
Sensebris tested a joint project with Fike Boots in the early 2000s, but the project was shut down due to a dispute over how profits from the chemist's shop would be shared in supermarkets.
Sensebris is adopting this new strategy after selling its 281 store's pharmacy business to Lloyd's Pharmacy's owner Celesio.
The company said that by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, Lloyds will contribute to the plan, which will include La Roche Poje and Vishi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sensebris, said: “We’ve changed the rice-covering of our islands to improve the environment for our buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be present to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all kinds of needs, and because of the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a reliable gamut destination that will challenge the old methods of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'fires up' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a deal with Mark & Spencer and ITV to focus on her new deal with the lifestyle brand of Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den.
There's no time like the present for their home furnishings and accessories.
The pair's business is compared to Gineth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The morning presenter, 37, announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute – which aims to focus on his new bumper deal with Mark & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became a "firefighter" when the golden girl of TV admitted in an interview at her business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new deal - valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no time for her home furnishings and the associated brand trolley.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's net worth to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced his departure from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on a jet plane for his holiday residence.
A source said: "Trolley was at the top of Halley's priority list so far.
It was part of his long-term future plans that would meet his economic needs for decades to come.
His decision to retire was a surprise to all involved.
No one could believe the incident that took place on Tuesday, the project was supposed to be launched soon.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse filling product that's ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of Dis Morning, who is currently one of Britain's most reliable stars, could cause the firm to lose millions of pounds as they have already invested heavily in products ranging from cushions to candles, cloth and household items, and a possible delay in its opening would add to the loss.
This can lead to the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for over a decade.
Willoughby began trolling with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple has a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPherlin as the presenter of the celebrity event at ITV's I Am.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked that after expressing a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and making a comment that some people would think is "non-presidential."
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his make-up "news presenter" voice.
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim is looking forward to meeting for the second time since their initial meeting in Singapore in June. Trump called their first meeting a huge step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
The nuclear disarmament talks have come to a halt.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the U.S. was not seeing a "relevant response" to North Korea's previous disarmament move.
However, he said the United States has imposed sanctions on the use of force.
During his speech at the rally, Trump expressed a more positive outlook.
"We are in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We are at war with North Korea.
It could have killed tens of millions of people.
We have a great relationship now."
He claimed his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – which ended rocket testing, helping to free prisoners and bring the rest of the American workforce back home.
And he supports the unusual way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president-elect, but instead of standing outside 10,000 people in this crowded arena, there were only 200 people standing right in front of him," Trump said.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia killed hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign private companies were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok people were displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have very clearly stated that they are not requesting international cooperation, so the issue is challenging," said Mr Sambang.
Although a team is gathering to go to Save the Children Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether foreign agencies will be allowed to participate in relief operations.
Despite the frequent earthquake in Indonesia, the country is desperately unprepared to deal with this wrath of nature.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, there are other beach resorts.
Despite the warning, the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, perhaps, has affected the loss of life.
Traveling to many islands in Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make communication more difficult.
A ship deployed to Lombok is going to the hospital in Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo put the development of Indonesia's vital infrastructure at the center of his election campaign, and he has invested huge sums of money in the construction of roads and railways.
But the lack of investment before next year's re-election has gripped Mr. Joko's government.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from Indonesia's long-standing communal tensions, where Muslim minorities have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 were left homeless in clashes between Christians and Muslims, two groups armed with batons, arrow bows and other rough weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Streisand equalises against Chelsea in the match
On Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Streisle saved Liverpool from a 89-minute loss to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Zardan Shakiri's pass was relegated to the scoreline of 30m in the Starz Chelsea goalpost, while his side was 1-0 behind.
He first took the ball forward to the left and then took a shot towards the distant post.
The shot goes to the right corner of the net at the top of the box.
In the end, the ball crossed the capa arizabalaga and entered the net.
"It's important to get to the right position to catch the ball on time, because players like Shaq always push the ball as much as possible before, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible," Starz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"When I see Kante coming forward, I give him a tap and I don't think there's a shot in the goal."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in half time as Belgian star Aden Hazard scored in the 25th minute of the game.
The Blues striker passed Matteo Kovacic, then ran away from midfield and entered Liverpool's Hafeez.
Kovacic went on to bowl in the midfield.
He then gave a beautiful ball to Hazarad in the box at Liverpool's defence.
Hazred defeated the defending players in the race and reached the goal with a shot from the left foot in the net of the distant post.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League in San Paulo, Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3pm on Thursday.
Death toll in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the rubble of the building that collapsed after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused a 20-foot-high flood, Sutopo Puro Nugro, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of 380,000, is filled with the ruins of the destroyed building.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman in a knife attack
A murder investigation was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in Berkkenhead Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at 7:55 a.m. in John Street's Grayson Muse, a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have invited the people of the area to inform them if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'm appealing to anyone who lives near John Street in Bergenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious."
I appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have any footage on their dash cameras, to contact us as they may have the information necessary for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Barkenhead and her body was found inside a house.
Friends, who think they know her, arrived at the scene this morning and asked where the woman's body was found.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are trying to inform the woman's relatives.
When a taxi driver in Grayson Mues tried to enter his flat, police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building or leave the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents of the building have been told that it will take several hours to allow them to enter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was crying at the scene.
He said: “It’s very sad.
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the barricade and another van was outside the barricade.
A group of police officers were observing the block of flats inside the barricade.
If anyone has any information, he is requested to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPollCC or call 101 or anonymously call the Crimestoppers on 0800 555 11 to log 247 on September 30.
A new victim of a dispute over the statue of Parliament's Chromewall 'History Rewriting'
The statue will be removed after the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious symbols at the hands of his hard-line followers.
But the Cromwell Society reported Mr. Crick's suggestion as "intelligent" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The statue of Oliver Cromwell, placed outside the Palace of Westminster in the present brickwork of the removal of the statue, was inevitable.
The activities of destroying iconoclasm or artifacts during the English Civil War were not performed by or under the order of Cromwell.
In the previous century, a statue of the wrong chromewall will be removed from the works of his predecessor Thomas.
The remarkable statue of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hammo Thorncroft, is a 19th-century expression of opinion and part of a historical character that many consider worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people think of Cromwell as the protector of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy – which is now less than people think, but was the opinion of many in the 19th century.
But whether this is an entirely accurate picture of the time is part of the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known character who has represented one of the parties in this category.
Her achievements as Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
The pig killed the Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, who has just been identified as his family's "Yuan," was found near a pig's stable in Liupanshui market in southern Guizhou province of China, bleeding from artery cuts and sores, according to a South China Morning Post report on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig herder in China's Qinghai province is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm.
He said he along with his Fupato brother came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and found the door of a pig's stall open next door.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A forensic test confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds had attacked and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were two bloody and bruised," Fupato's brother told Guiyang Evening News, citing his ancestry as "U."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that kills the man is not the man or his brother.
A market manager told Evening News that police were collecting evidence at the scene and the pig was kept in isolation so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating to determine the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, the attack on pigs has happened before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband attacked a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig, Exxon Welsh, put the farmer in his tractor until his wife came and drove the pig out in fear.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his pig in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but can act as a "trigger or stimulant" to get a taste of blood.
"They're just evil.
They make small bites, very interested animals... but don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to understand them well enough," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rossa will cause heavy rains across the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa's strength is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the rosa will cause heavy rains causing flooding in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenie, Mexico.
We're heading north on Sunday.
In this direction, a system in the Pacific Ocean has begun to take shape and is heading east toward the West Coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD>s will hit the California Peninsula as a seasonal storm and it will push deep tropical humidity northwards toward the southwestern United States.
More than 10 inches of rain is expected in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, the deep cyclonic circulation will be linked to the system leading to heavy rainfall in the coming days over the south-eastern region.
Locally, rainfall ranging from 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash flooding or flash floods, destructive flows, and possible landslides in the desert
Due to the deep tropical humidity, rainfall at many places can range from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to range from 2 to 4 inches in parts of the southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Flash flooding and the deterioration of the situation is possible due to the scattered speed of the tropical rain.
It would be foolish to walk in the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Due to heavy rains, canyons can become a dangerous river and there will be strong winds with dust due to thunderstorms.
Due to the storm system, there will be locally heavy rain in various parts of the coastal region of Southern California.
The amount of rainfall can be up to half an inch, which can cause small debris to flow on bright roads.
This will be the first rain in the region.
There will be some scattered tropical rain over Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, after which the rain will increase and spread to the entire area from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rain is expected to continue into Tuesday and into Wednesday.
A number of extreme temperature changes may be seen in different regions of the United States in October as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This sometimes results in a dramatic change in temperature within a short distance.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and spread again.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm in most parts of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures as high as 80 in areas from the southern plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, about 10 degrees above the average temperature.
Our long-term climate forecasts suggest that in the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern part of the United States are likely to be higher than average temperatures.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brett Cavanaugh.
The tense testimony of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazi Ford, who is accused of sexual assault, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, has been seen by more than 20 million viewers across six television networks on Thursday.
In this direction, the political controversy continues, with broadcasters suspending regular shows due to Friday's last-minute surprise: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that would give the FBI a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh was drunk at a high school party and tried to open his clothes.
Cavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that the incident did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people in Nilssen's report watched the event on Friday.
The company was averaging viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available to the audience.
And Nilssen usually faces problems in the quality of the audience he meets in the office.
The number of spectators was the same as in the playoffs or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinion show presenters strongly supported Cavan's nomination, attracted the highest number of viewers across all networks broadcasting hearings throughout the day that averaged 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS watched 3.1 million, NBC watched 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million, and CNN watched 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
Even after the hearing, there was interest.
Fleck was the central character in today's play.
After making statements that he would vote for Cavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when he boarded the elevator to reach the Judicial Committee hearing venue, and protesters shouted for him.
He stood in front of the protesters for a few minutes, broadcasting live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe that the government is telling the truth?
She is told, "You have the power, while many women are helpless."
Fleck said his office made a statement and said he had more to say at the committee's hearing before the lift was closed.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Cavan's nomination to a full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcast networks broadcast live.
But Flake said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which were requested by the minority Democrats.
His conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kune, was partly influenced by Fleck's consent.
After speaking to Kun, Fleck spoke to several other senators and came to his decision.
Flake's decision was suffocating, because it was clear that the Republicans did not have a vote to approve Cavanaugh except for an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing a “political game” over Britain’s future and ignoring the interests of the nation.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview printed next to his interview on the front page of the paper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called checkers plan for Brexit, saying Britain and the European Union offered to collect each other's revenue was "totally unreasonable."
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson over LSU player’s death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the altercation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fighting.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and reported that Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, CBS associate WAFB said in a report.
Following Simpson's arrest, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to The Advocate's report, his bail has been set at $350,000.
The post-mortem investigator's office in the East Baton Rouge area released a preliminary report on Friday citing injuries to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department is credited with assisting the Louisiana State Police's task force in tracking the fugitive suspect, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and residents of the area in an investigation that led to the suspect's arrest.
Athletic Director of LSU Joe Aleva thanked the area's law enforcement agency for its "relentless efforts and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot 6-inch forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply saddened" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's always a matter of concern," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Volcanic eruptions from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Response Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after the volcano's mouth activity increased and the amount of gas and steam produced reached 183 on the scale within 24 hours.
The center was observing a number of roars and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed the vehicle's windshield in areas like Jochimilco in Mexico City falling thin.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017, just 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a clash with riot police with pro-independence protesters as they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first year of voting, focusing on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs, and coloured powder at the police barricades, causing black clouds in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
At the end of the day, there was a fight, which the police used sticks to stop.
For several hours, protesters chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" in front of unity supporters who chanted "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries as a result of the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been simmering in the region since Madrid declared the October 1 Catalan independence referendum illegal.
The majority of voters voted in favor of independence, although the number of voters was low because the majority of the public against secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, more than 1,000 people were killed in violent clashes with police last year when they were barred from voting in the region.
The protesters remained on the streets throughout the night to protest against the police action.
The protesters continued their activities, but were forced to take to different streets.
68-year-old Narcissus Termis, a power worker who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
"I saw water coming in my parents' eyes to be happy to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a significant but narrow victory in the provincial elections last December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have struggled to maintain their momentum where many of their known leaders are awaiting trial either voluntarily exiled or detained for their organization's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the protest in support of police on her phone, said politicians on both sides had created the conflict.
He added, “The unrest is intensifying day by day.”
Oryol Junckeras, one of the Catalan leaders who is not in pre-trial prison, announced late last year that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“The best way to resist the suppression and persecution of democratic values from the Spanish government is to stand as a European election candidate,” he said.
London: Man arrested after car collision with house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly being hit by a car at a home in London.
The incident took place at Balinagard Crescent at 19:30 Bangladesh time on Thursday.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blimings said the gates and buildings were damaged.
At some point, the car may have been hit and run.
Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers in the men's goal.
Dolly Menger scored the first goal for Livingston.
Steven Gerrard has been awarded the second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ibrox club, thanks to the promoted Livingston Rangers.
Dolly Menger created the gap as Gary Holt's team equalized with the Hibernians in the second goal.
As a result, Gerard's team left without a win in the Premiership this season and on Sunday they will face the top-ranked Harts, who are eight points ahead of them.
Earlier on Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, already ramping up their unbeaten run in the division to six games, has yet to taste defeats as head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a lot of chances against his defenseless opponent.
They should have been ahead of Holt's team long before they scored, since their aggressive attitude caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson went ahead with the defense but failed to make his own efforts fruitful, then Alan Lithgo could only drive his effort wide enough to pass after sliding to meet Craig Halket's header.
The hosts were letting the Rangers play in front of them knowing that the guests could cause trouble in the set-pieces.
And that was the main goal.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and opened the account of the Livingston goal. Declan Gallagher and Robinson Menga came together to set up, who scored from the center of the box in one touch.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball, but they were treating the hosts' defenses as impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of his time eviscerating.
This trend continued even in the second half, though Alfredo Morlows had a shot at Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's foot and won another set piece for Livingston from Lithgo Wide.
The crosses were constantly coming into the Livingston box and constantly becoming clearer, though the two penalty claims - alternative Glenn Middleton - were rejected after Hallett's challenge and for handball.
" The Incredibles " by Livingston
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony McCarney
Excellent performance and results on behalf of Livingston.
To a person, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations at their upward speed.
Their style of play and players have rarely changed since returning to the top level, but credit will have to go to Holt for the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was outstanding, built a superbly organized defense, and kept Menga Conor Goldson and Joe Warhol on the edge all the time.
The Rangers, however, were less motivated.
Under Gerard they were as good as they were.
They lacked a final ball - only once they had opened the hosts - and this is a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The situation was very pleasant as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday for Brexit.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing ties between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then marched to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police made a security blanket to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - were heard in their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and his decision to welcome him home in Germany.
This conflict demonstration proves that a visitor is admired by the German Turks as a hero and condemned by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Depotford: Biker killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10 a.m. Bangladesh time.
The driver stopped the vehicle and the cyclist was given first aid, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened again a few months after another bicycle accident on Children's Street, located 1 mile from the site of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin.
The road has been closed and bus barriers have been installed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lertin Prison: Six officers injured in chaos.
Six Prison officers were injured in the chaos in the high-security male prison, the Prison Office said in a statement.
On Sunday, at 9.30 am, chaos broke out in the HMP Long Lartine in Orchestershire.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the chaos, which includes eight prisoners who belong to a branch.
Officers at the scene were treated for facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to deal with an incident going on in HMP Long Larten.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be taken under the law and they will spend longer behind bars.”
HMP Long Laurentin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator went to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, Wright officers were called to prison to deal with a serious disorder where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (Although drought prone areas may benefit)
The incidence of tropical depressions hitting Arizona is rare, but that seems to be exactly what will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa will scramble with its remaining energy across the southwestern desert with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Department has already issued a flash flood watch for Monday and Tuesday in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, including southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah in western Arizona.
Rosa is expected to directly pass over Phoenix on Tuesday and reach with rain by the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Department of Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or sub-tropical conditions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the A-Z border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall from 2 to 4 inches, with the Moglon Rim in Arizona, which can be up to 6 inches in isolated quantities.
Other regions of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, have a chance of roughly 1 to 2 inches of rain, which can range up to 4 inches in isolated quantities.
Rainfall can be a blessing for those who are out of the flood risk as the areas are drier.
Although floods are a very serious concern, this rainfall is likely to be of some benefit as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, according to Weather.com, which is the second-highest category.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route will cause landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which is still a powerful hurricane, is moving at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is facing cold water in the Pacific Ocean.
So, the force of the tropical storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening
Heavy rainfall can occur across parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
"There is a possibility of up to 10 inches of rain from Baja California to northwestern Sonora"
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning and it will enter southern Utah via Arizona on Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from roja or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall can result in catastrophic flooding and destructive currents in the desert and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsamer Norton attack: Arrested for attempting to murder four people.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in Somerset after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed to death.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4pm on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is now in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have appealed to those who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump said that he was referring to the "brutalness, anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote in favor of Judge Cavanaugh, a vote in favour of the Democratic Party's brutal and outrageous strategy," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been a victim of the Democratic Party's "cruelty, anger" throughout his nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she was sexually abused by him decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing of his complaint.
The President said on Saturday that “the American people have seen the extraordinaryness and virtues and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
To the supporters of West Virginia, he said that a vote on behalf of Jazz Kavanaugh would be a vote to protect a lawyer with the sterling record of public service, one of the most successful legal entities of our time.”
The president vaguely acknowledged the nomination of Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections.
"It's just five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not participating, but I'm really participating," he said.
“That’s why I’m always striving to fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a "resistance and deterrence" mission.
The Senate's first major presidential vote on Cavanaugh's nomination is not expected to take place on Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's tsunami.
At least 384 people have been killed and many others have been swept away after a massive wave hit a beach in Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-feet) high wave collapsed on the coast in the evening, leading many to their deaths and destroying everything on the way.”
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Even when the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were continuing their activities on the beach and those who could not run immediately and became victims of it," Sutopo Puro Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses all by itself, it hit everything above the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 kilometers (497 miles) per hour in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the sky released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque submerged in water.
Aftershocks continue to strike the coastal city on Saturday as well.
The series of earthquakes were felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the power released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could further exacerbate the size of the tsunami
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the wounded bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher in a region called Dongala, close to the epicentre of the earthquake, along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu.
"The communication system was completely paralysed without any information," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.”
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not providing the information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time of the warning being issued.
Footage shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building yelling at people on the streets below, warning them of the impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water flooded the shore and flooded the building and the car.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that cut off communication around the Palu and made the rescue operations of the authorities inconvenient.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, adding that rescuers are now in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed to the general public until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit Palu shelters on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
According to Mr Doseber, when the World Organization staff were safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the employees were taking shelter in their office premises, they saw images of destruction along the way.
"They've seen a lot of houses destroyed," Dosseva added.
That's sad.
Even when aid teams went to start disaster relief operations, some were still complaining that many skilled foreign aid workers were being barred from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, funding, food supplies and staff from abroad can only come when the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
But it has not been announced yet.
"This is still a province-level disaster," said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says yes, it's a national disaster, we can start international aid, but there is no announcement yet."
On the second night of Friday's tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing are hoping for miracles that will bring their hope of finding them at the end of a brutal chapter of natural disasters.
A little boy was rescued from the river on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been carrying stones for two days near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Jendon Subandono, trained two paragliders from the Asian Games, who are now missing, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that those who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
He added, "I have a responsibility to my own emotions as a pioneer in the paragliding field."
Mr. Jendon recalled how the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had spread to the paragliding community hours later, he backtracked and circulated it to the Palu competitors via WhatsApp messages, who had attended a festival on the beach.
His message was rejected instead of being read.
He said, "That means the message was not sent."
The thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM machine in Newport.
The Newport Police Department said in a press release that the thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning while the Brinks staff kept the money at an ATM.
The driver was emptying out ATM money at the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more money, Detective Denis McCarthy said at a press conference.
While he was at work, another "bricks ran from behind a worker" and ran away with a bag full of money that was ready to be handed over.
According to the news release, the witness saw many suspects fleeing, but police have not yet determined the number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone can identify these people, they are asked to contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Ken West: This rapper has changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Ken West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: “Officially known as Ken West.”
West, 41, was also known as Ye for quite some time and used the name as his surname.
The name change was revealed before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she hoped to release her new album Yandee.
The show's producer said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons."
West had previously said that the word was of religious significance to him, as well as a shortened form of his current professional name.
At the beginning of the West year, radio presenter Big Boy, while discussing the title of the album, said, “I believe that ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’.”
"It's you, it's us, it's us.
It is said from Cain that it means that the only person, Ye, reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more of our identity."
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known in many ways as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD, but this year he announced that he preferred the name of Love and Brotherly Love.
J-G, a former associate of West, has worked with and without Hyphen, and with the capital.
Mexico's AMLO has also vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez has vowed not to use military force against civilians on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador vowed on Saturday at the Toltec Plaza that “do not apply military force to the oppression of the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire in peaceful protests that killed 300 people while left-wing student movements were building a strong foothold in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador has apologised to young Mexicans for helping build more public universities and monthly education allowances.
He said unemployment and lack of access to education are attracting young people to crime syndicates.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should also double the amount spent on research in this field, said artificial intelligence researcher and investor Kai-fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement comes from various parts of the government, including the United States, which has declared that the United States has a formal strategic deficit in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its new plan last year: it aims to rank No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget in artificial intelligence research will be a good new beginning where most countries are far behind in this field and we are looking for the next step in advancing artificial intelligence.”
Double funding could double the likelihood of the United States acquiring the next big artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month is Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Venture, which has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked at Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked American player, and was executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged the technology competition of the previous U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, to determine the next step.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"China is not removing academic leaders; corporates are giving up," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recruited brilliant people from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could help further U.S. AI efforts.
“I think the green card should be offered automatically to Ph.D. in artificial intelligence,” he said. SI’s AI efforts further exacerbated.
China's State Council issued its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that spend money on U.S. researchers, but the standard of academic work in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means engaging partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a selection committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law attempting to form the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any progress in months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece that blocked the EU and NATO's bid to gain membership.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, has its northern neighbor's name representing a claim to its territory and vetoed the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition believes the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President J<0xC3><0xA9>rz Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and doubted whether the turn-out would meet the minimum 50 percent required to make the referendum legal in a boycott campaign.
The question in the referendum ballot was: “You are for NATO and EU membership with recognition of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, have argued for a price to be paid for joining the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because that means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivier Georgievska Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote by taking a decision.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, only 16 per cent voted, while 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I have come to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe," said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tenevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko have voted to change the country's name in favor of a referendum in Macedonia, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join Strumacia in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
The 54-year-old was preparing a small stage in front of Skopje parliament and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with our heads high, not through the door of service," Kavdarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia solidarity.”
Prime Minister Zeev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," Zayev said after his ballot.
He said that a “yes” result would be our “confirmation of the future.”
A poll released on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia said 30 to 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum below the required turnout for the turn-out.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents who received it are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-five percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it needs to be more than 50 percent of the vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since taking power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero get into full Brighton defense for goal
On Saturday, Manchester City defeated Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made it extra easy to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before heading to the open field.
The fire was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned a defender before he surpassed several others at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward uses his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to give a shot on the right side of the net, defeating Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his legs," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, Sterling gave Sky Blues the primary advantage in the Premier League's fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen with a beautiful path on the left side edge.
He took a few touchdowns before taking Sterling to a distant post.
Sky Blues tapped the ball into the net just before the forward crossed the boundary.
City will face Hofenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Ren-Necker-Arena in Sinheim, Germany.
Roger Federer wants to play in the World Cup
There was not much reason to force the Nationals to start any other after being removed from the playoff debate.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the play-offs have an impact on the one-game lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the NL West.
Rickys won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night to get at least a wild card spot, but they are still looking to earn their first division title.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can get on the rubber with Denver's audience knowing the atmosphere and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I'm facing this year," he said.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but there are rumors that Scherzer might be allowed to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will begin his 34th term, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and pitch at his usual restaurant on Sunday.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president sharply mentioned the surrounding situation to his Supreme Court-elect Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we did in November was in jeopardy.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running because I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to use whatever means necessary to return the energy, you see this lowness, ugliness.
It doesn't matter who they're hitting, who they're beating to get power and control over, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "prevent and disrupt."
"And you've seen that over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "crazy and low and ugly and untrustworthy."
He named Democratic Senator Diane Finstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received high-pitched applause from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Did you get the code?
Oh, oh, what.
No, ah no, I wait – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer a free society.
People who say what they think are not allowed to say it.
It was not a surprise when my party's workers blamed me for voting.
Because your mind won't welcome the nature of bowling here - I was the last Labour MP on the list to tell you that.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she firmly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, concerning Europe and national security, and on similar issues, on which Jeremy did not even agree with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For the first time in eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was exactly the same.
But unfortunately, today, it is not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "kind, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It has been increasingly evident that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable for the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, with colleagues who I thought expressed a similar political point of view, they began to expect me to take a U-turn and to take a position that I would not have agreed under any circumstances - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak out in public — and although it doesn’t matter what I say — there’s a call to remove me from social media, there’s a condemnation of the Centre’s politics, and I’m told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of all colleagues who face the storm of discrimination or racial abuse on the basis of sex every day but never feel ashamed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of bullying has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free-for-all organization, and every "non-state" vote or change of election rules narrows the party.
For the past two years, many people have been advising me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal, and to be "okay" or "okay."
I'm not in politics to do that.
When I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, we were provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally destroyed our extensive school classrooms, I tried to provide the necessary public service to those who needed it most – whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been in any way confused about my policy stance and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I can say for those who promoted this movement on Friday is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy by showing loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I really don’t have a message for Nottingham Momentum, it’s to my constituents, whether or not I’m a member of the Labour Party: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that the threat of a stalemate or political activity won’t stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
38 to 17 Melrose: Rise to the top of the unearned income
The two late attempts may have somewhat reduced the final result's margin, but there is no doubt that in this day's extraordinary entertaining Tennant's Premiership match, Earn deserved to win.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good as their ability to take chances, which helped the hosts win and was the proper reason to be happy with coach Peter Murchi.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy."
Melrose’s Robin Christie says: “Iron has to give credit, they’ve put their prospects to better use than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, puts Iyer ahead, however, a yellow card from Scotland player Rory Hughes, who fired him for the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a majority, and Jason Bagot an unsuccessful attempt.
Clemo scored a penalty to increase the lead, just before, during the halftime, he scored in a single effort to make the break 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then the game was stopped for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruiard Nott, who became a stretcher and after the restart of the game, the earnings went much further through the efforts of Stafford McDowell, who was transformed by Clemmo.
Acting captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card and, once again, after a spell of severe pressure, Melrose's Bruce Colvin punished the additional player of the attempt.
However, the hosts came back right away, and when Steven Hutchinson saw a yellow card to tackle Klimo without a ball, McPherson made a touchdown from the penalty line out and pushed the revenue mall forward.
Once again Clymo was converted, by Kyle Rowe when David Armstrong's box-kick fouled and Flanker sent Gregor Henry out on the fifth attempt on the home side.
The Steel Game star restaurant is ready for a new career in the industry
Steel game star Ford Kieran has said he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he himself wrote and co-starred with long-time comedian Greg Hemfill.
Both have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last series of the show and it looks like Kiernan is planning his own life after Kreiglang.
According to the list of official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although Scottish Sun sources indicated that Kiernan wanted to get involved with Glasgow's "rich restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigging clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean-blue flag.
The naval bases in Amazon from Lake Titicaca are decorated with this motto: "The sea is our right."
It's a responsibility to restore."
Everywhere in the landlocked Bolivia, losing to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict, the memory of the coast is still vivid – just as eager to sail once more into the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that speed, unity and pure spirit and of course we are looking forward to the result with a positive outlook," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see ICJ rulings on a large scale across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will go in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of proper negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate on giving Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who will face a controversial fight for re-election next year - also relies a lot on Monday's ruling.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court is unlikely to make a decision for Bolivia - and even if it does, that will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency does not have the power to grant land to Chile and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The ICJ ruling that comes just six months after hearing the final argument indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Jarrett, an expert on Chilean international law.
And in the last four years, it may have lagged behind the cause of Bolivia, rather than moving forward.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of sea entry," said Jerrett.
Morales' anti-war speech has sparked any extravagance of goodwill in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk up to a point, but it will be very difficult to talk after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Hague's Bolivian representative, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltzi, has rejected the court's decision being unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia's "an extraordinary opportunity of a new era in relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to bring an end to 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits."
Calzadila also denies that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the issue of maritime as a political pole.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States believes in it.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not disarm nuclear weapons first if Washington cannot be trusted.
He was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to abide by the commitments made by rival leaders during a summit in Singapore.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on track with North Korea's Kim Jong Un to restart Singapore's stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months later.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and the U.S.'s objection to the Korean War's end would put North Korea at risk.
Washington has warned that Pyongyang could agree to the declaration without first having to go through a significant disarmament process.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an armistice, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo also plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveals The Latest Line Of Huge Headwear On The Way To A High Street Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, there's no need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown have unveiled a trend of oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway that rocked the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, a very unusual hat has been left on Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to Catawba.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top beige hat that was equipped with a wide fork like a feather that covered the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories include decorative melons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has also released a selection of bizarre masks - and at exactly the right time for Halloween.
The lips of many colored masks were similar to Hannibal's lacquer when stitched and compared to the awesome funny.
One creation resembles a full scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other resembles a molten ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement - you're in luck.
Style observers have predicted that huge bonnets could go to the high street near you.
Outsized hats compete with La Bomba, a two-foot wide-shouldered straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski is seen wearing.
The cult label on the back of the highly unscrupulous hat scattered across social media has sent another large creation to the catwalk - a straw beech bag that is almost as large as the swimwear model.
The orange ruffia bag, burnt in the collection of Paris Fashion Week's La R<0xC3><0xA9>verera SS19, was one of them, with ruffia fringed and a white leather handle at the top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Fimail: ‘I hope big big hats and beach bags will arrive on High Street next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.’
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, and this continues to be the result of another outstanding test in 2018, which is only reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Individual schools aim to prepare their students for more and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a particular school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue to be popular and preferred in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.”
"If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent test, we can see that languages top the league tables with the highest pass rate among individual schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language students have achieved a higher grade.
Data collected from schools of 74 SCIS members showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent achieved higher grades in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language now, as a subject choice, is being held in the same way as individual school curriculum and elsewhere in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers attributed their language skills to the reasons why employers struggled to fill vacancies.
So more and more, language skills are becoming essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are needed in a globalized world for more potential job opportunities that require language.
Anyone who chooses a career Nick, if they learn a second language, will have a real advantage in the future with their lifetime skills acquired.
Being able to communicate directly with people abroad automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov, of the more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well during the conversation, and French was the only language of the decade-numbered percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language education is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially the language of a developing economy, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while a look at 2020 shows that others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, including specialist teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and make them with the skills necessary to succeed in whatever the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied at the moment that languages play an important role in the future of the country, so it must be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity and encouragement for the youth of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans are waiting to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will likely play a limited-minute game.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump stormed a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including a stop in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for confirmation of his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy remains at a pause, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia rally below through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak this week about the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been heated over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected Senate confirmation vote during an FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of opening these rallies is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
In this way, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to "emphasize volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to its agenda that as we enter the busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
As scheduled for Wesbenco Arena at Wheeling, today's rally could bring "supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia since last month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morsi that the president should try to encourage him more in the election," Simon Heder, a West Virginia university politician, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA hungry to fight to keep hope alive in Sunday's singles
The driver's cup was required by Saturday afternoon after three one-sided sessions.
The swing of the pendulum at Momentum is a completely invented sport concept but in it the players truly believe, and most of all in such competitions.
Where's the moose now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little bit of momentum now," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with 12 more games remaining, leading by four points.
As Spieth said, Americans feel they have a bit of help on their way and they can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and they both took four to three points.
Speth was fatal from the start to the end and leading from the front.
As his round of applause grew louder, the four-point full-squad match was more important to grab when he and Thomas were still behind by two points after scoring two.
The putt he won the match at 15, got the same shouts, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You really have to go deep and think about your own game," said Spieth.
All the players have it now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are simply Francisco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but adorable pair of fours and fours can't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who didn't shoot any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings at the back nine.
The run, and the way their energy was flowing in and out of this enthusiastic crowd, looked like they were losing players on Sunday, and as the sun sets on Le Golf National, there are no more likely popular players to seal a European victory without Fleetwood or Mallinari.
It would be better if they were in different places at the same time.
However, the European influence is still intact.
Bobba Watson and Web Simpson had some problems for the morning foreball hero Sergio Garcia while pairing up with Alex Noreen.
The first nine threw a bogey and two double spaniards and the Swedes into a hole from which they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
It is very interesting to see from close to Foreball and Foursome due to the interaction between the pair bindings, the advice they give, that they do not suggest, and the technique that can be changed instantly.
Europe has so far played relatively well as a team and taken an important lead on the final day, but this foursome session further proves that Team USA's appetite for fighting is something that some, especially the Stateside, suspected.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will take a healthy advantage with a 10-6 interval lead against the United States from Saturday's Foreball and Foursam match.
Enthusiastic pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Malinari have now taken their tally to four points in the Golf Nationals, leading them to a two-time victory against the two-dusty Tiger Woods.
Thomas Jorne's European team, bidding to restore the trophy that was lost at Hazeltin two years ago, won the series 3-1 by blowing up the flawed American side at the morning foreballs.
The U.S. offered more resistance at Foursam, winning two matches, but they failed to meet the deficit.
Jim Furyk needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to regain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Mallinari, together with "Mollywood," are just the second pair to earn four points from the first four matches in Ryder Cup history after an extraordinary weekend.
Pushing Woods and Patrick Reed to the fore, they then executed Superfly brilliantly to defeat a losing Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambeau by 5 and 4 more strongly.
Woods, who pulled himself out of both games on Saturday, occasionally stormed the limelight but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning force, returns to partner Henrik Stenson at Foursam to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1 - the world's number one and three.
A pleasant, windy day on the south-west side of Paris, although it was not on its own in Europe.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Spain's Zone Ram and Ian Polter in Foreball and came back after losing to the opening two holes in Foursam, defeating Polter and Rory McLroy in 4 and 3.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned from a four-point deficit in the singles, though as of now, only a draw is needed to restore the trophy on Furik's side.
After being the second best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack looks like it will overtake them.
North Korea has said it will not unilaterally disarm without "any form of trust."
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that existing sanctions were deepening distrust of the United States and that there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organization's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear laboratory, and promising not to increase the spread of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.
“But we did not see any similar reaction in the United States,” he said.
“If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm in such a situation.”
Although Ri was describing North Korea's accusations against Washington's "solid" approach to nuclear disarmament that would be rewarded for North Korea's slow action, his remarks appeared to be significant because he did not unilaterally exclude nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on “disarmament-first” and has increased the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objectives with impunity, even as they object to the declaration of “the end of the war,” Ri said.
"The idea that prohibitions can threaten our soil is an illusory dream for those of us who don't know.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri made no comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president highlighted earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister cited three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If the issue of disarmament had been South Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so stale.”
Still, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly it was inevitable that the U.S. would target the mainland with a North Korean rocket when "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim a "rocket man."
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearize.
"If it takes two years, three years or five months to do it - it doesn't matter," Trump said on Wednesday.
China and Russia argue that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the UN Security Council
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Americans. The Security Council on Thursday that: “The Security Council’s sanctions must be effectively continued until we fully understand the final Verified Disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rie in the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He said while leaving Pyongyang in July that some progress had been made, only until a few hours before North Korea condemned him for making "assault-like claims"!
North Korea had promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon earlier this month if the U.S. takes "similar measures."
He said that the "related measures" Kim had been looking for were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore and the security guarantees he had moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University completes the caffeine-fuelled <0xC2><0xAB>Rat awake», offering all of its graduates a way to get more sleep to cope with the growing culture of studying at night.
An educator has discovered that students at the number one university in the world are often confused about very basic things about how to take care of themselves.
The course was developed by Charles Sigillar, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the impact sleep deprivation had on the education sector.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I told this all the time, my senior year?’”
"He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told the Telegraph.
This course, which began for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits help students academic and athletic performance as well as what they need to improve their general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care department, said the university decided to launch the course after students were severely deprived of sleep this week.
The one hour long course has some interrelated tasks.
There is an image of a dorm room in a section, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on the coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books and learn how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as if you decided to smoke cigarettes, but also have the right to know its effects on health."
He said the culture of “staying awake all night” pride still exists, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
Ensuring your adequate quality of sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – even sleep deprivation makes the brain hungry, making them constantly hungry.”
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old studying chemical and physical biology in California, helped Prof. Siegeller design the course, taking a class during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to take a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all postgraduate students will be requested to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cijila recommended that students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can destroy your circadian rhythm, resulting in problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The defeat of the Manger Gollum Gerard.
The Rangers lost another avenue in Dolly Menger's goal as Steven Gerrard's random team lost 1-0 to Livingston.
After a 4-1 win in St. John's in February, Ibrox's team looked for another win, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerard's second defeat as manager in 18 matches, which took him eight points away from the Hearts at the top of Ledbrook's Premiership.
Menga was injured seven minutes before half-time, but the hopeful Rangers line-up never gave them a chance.
Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston has moved up to third place and has overtaken Hibernians in goal difference.
And there could be more problems for the rangers because the lineman Callum Spence had to be treated for a head injury for an object thrown from the avenue edge.
Gerard has made eight changes to the team that has made it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same live 11 that took a point from the Harts last week and should be proud of the way his well-rounded team repulsed the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with their balls.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menger sent Scott Pittman to the first leg of Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered his big chance.
Kegan Jacobs had a tall free-kick captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo was only able to hit the ball in the back post.
The Rangers regained control but had more hope than they believed in playing in the final third.
Alfredo Morales must have felt that his penalty should have been found in the quarter-hour due to the clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's plea.
Rangers could only target two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely in trouble by head and Ovi Azaria shot.
Livi's 34th minute opening goal may have been against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they are the architects of their own game.
The Rangers again failed to handle the deep set-pieces of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react because of the Deccan gala Scott Robinson's ball slot, he kept his head cold to pick up Menga for the usual finishing.
Gerard took action at the break to replace Coolie with Ryan Kent, and the replacement was going to be in use almost immediately since the winger was in Morells, but the extraordinary Kelly moved him from the line to the block.
However, since Livingston visitors began to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, Lithgo and Halket were sending long balls after a long ball.
Holt's team could have taken their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood to ruin Jacobs' effort before heading off to Lithgo Corner.
As soon as he faltered with Jacobs, Thomson again turned his back on the demands of Glen Middleton, a Substitute for the Rangers, who claimed the late penalty.
Almanac: The inventor of the geyser counter.
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Guyger was born in Germany.
Guyger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually became known as Guyger Counter.
From then on a core of science, Guyger Counter also became the core of a pop culture, in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring seemingly promising cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter, used to identify radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you give these earphones to the bride, you can hear the effects of atoms given by radioactivity between the minerals.”
Evans: "Does it make a lot of noise?"
"Hans" Guyger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
His discovery is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system the detection of malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then 'see' a protein that is common for many cancers and then re-introduced.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different levels of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the common protein of many cancers called HER2, and then re-introduction of the cells.
Professor J. Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
"Her2 causes an increase in a variety of cancers, including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer," explains Professor Barzofsky.
A similar approach has been used to treat leukemia to eliminate immune cells outside patients and "learn" how to target cancer cells.
Kanye West is in the midst of a pro-Trump controversy
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio after a lengthy performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would continue in office even in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times when I talk to a white person, they say: “How could you like Trump, he’s a racist!”
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gotten out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon where this Hollywood star Christine Blazi joked with Brett Cavanaugh's testimony on the Senate Judiciary Committee about Ford's sexual assault claims.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's satirical footage of the comedian Chris Rock has been uploaded on social media.
It's not clear if the West has tried to mock the West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he also had to face problems in the backstage with his head covered.
"They put me in the backseat.
He said, "Don't wear a hat."
They've pissed me off!
And then they said I'm in a sinking place," according to the Washington Examiner's formula.
West added: “Do you want to see the place?” This is saying that he will read his own “Superman Cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Do you want to see the world move forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members were embarrassed, Variety reported, where one person told the publication: “There was a pinprick silence throughout the studio.”
West was brought in as an alternative to singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West I Love It song's performance has confused many people by decorating them like a periare bottle.
West has received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up against the evil doers.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was what it was and he's absolutely fantastic."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who is embracing and spreading harmful ideals for my community."
He is independent.
"We are too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the path of DD, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and PDD.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Leon and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol that was previously known as Prince.

Assange is expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacked toxic masculinity or toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his combative role as Zone Snow in HBO's offensive medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has said about the stereotype of the hero, saying that playing such a role on the screen means giving young boys the impression that they have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times culture, he said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how he could tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, has admitted that she feels strongly about the problem.
"I personally, quite strongly feel, at the moment - where are we going wrong in masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach them as men were growing up, that we are facing this problem now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its overly masculine characters.
He said: "What are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the street that boys feel that they have to follow this particular path to be a man?
I think that's one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because obviously young people have made a big mistake.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones previews or sequels when the series is renewed next summer, saying he had ended the life of the "warfield and horse."
From November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, a film about a producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it gave my future family my life"
In the Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Egret played the character of Kite's lover, John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 cases in the country, health officials said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were due to sexual transmission, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly to different parts of China for blood circulation.
But the number of people infected with HIV on this route has been brought down to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still seen as rampant.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men later marry women.
Many diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies data leaks to GOP senators, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims were being propagated by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both U.S. Senators.
The information was published online on Thursday, after an unidentified person posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholars and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the "Waters" office and revealed information of which member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and a perfect lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds and false allegations - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information."
These baseless allegations are completely wrong and a perfect lie."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism from many online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
"This denial is infuriating," Fletcher wrote.
"It shows that he has no inclination to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't get angry.
They should not be controversial.
They must not question the motives of the complainant.
They must be calm and serene."
Fletcher was comparing Waters' reaction to criticism from Democrats about Judge Cavanaugh, which critics found him very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's really big," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" about these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed,” he continued, “and will be legally held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any member of my staff and all members.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review – Weak Rowan Atkinson Spying
It is now traditional to see Brexit significance in any new film, including a British thriller, and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and Johnny English returned to life in 2011.
How much of that waste is going to be a new export opportunity for the nation?
At any rate, pop-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny English has a license to create new things for the second time - his name more than anything else indicates that he is a broad comic creation designed for the movie world of languages other than English.
He is certainly a stupid secret representative who, despite the bizarre tendency of smooth tangles, is somewhat bound, a dash of Mr. Bean and a dollop of Chap contributed a note to the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London at the Charlottes of Fire theme tune.
He is based primarily on Traveller and starred in Barclays TV commercials once forgotten by Atkinson, a man of international mystery.
This last J.E. outing has one or two great moments.
I'd love to see Johnny English come close to a helicopter while the rotor blades hanging with a little helmet in a medieval armored dress.
Atkinson's gift for physical humor has been shown, but the humor has been quite low-quality and oddly exaggerated, especially since "Serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer humor as a component with confidence.
The joke seems like it's aimed at kids rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's freaking accidents aren't as innovative and centralized as Atkinson's silent-cinema jokes on Bean's personality.
Over the years, the UK has been in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker penetrated the ultra-secret web network of Britain's spying, to reveal the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to frustrate the agent in charge - sadly a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last of the hopes of a prime minister who is already suffering a complete recession of political dissent, he is a rare and bound figure: Emma Thompson has done her best with this semi-trespass-may character but there is not much to do in the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to get someone out of retirement.
And that means speaking to Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher in some Pashtun institutions, but teaches beyond the record about how to be a disguised worker: there are some good jokes, since English offers a school of detective rock-type academies here.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-sufficing sidekick Bau, starring Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a jolly-hockey-stick in which Vicky Pepperdine has been somewhat squandered.
So the Batman and Robin returned to action to make a serious mistake in Har Majesty's Secret Service and face Olga Kurelenko's mistress, Ophelia Bulitova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling into the trap of the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta starring Jack Lacy.
English and Bau began to make strange noises of their far-reaching high-generics: under the guise of Waiter they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they started fighting by pushing themselves into the luxurious boat of Volta; and trying to use the virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the interior of the English Volta house.
All stops are definitely drawn for the last sequence, but as sweet and upbeat as it is, there's quite a bit of kids TV thinking about the whole thing.
A lot of middle staff.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn’t have imagined: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that it is planning to work four days a week for Britain but will get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a key plan that will see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
The team wants the company's owners to share the money they've saved with an extra day off for employees through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
This will allow employees to enjoy a three-day holiday - but still raise the same salary at home.
Sources said that the idea will be "fit" with the party's economic programme and there are plans to move the country on behalf of the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has approved a four-day week as a way to take advantage of the changing economy of workers.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight but a four-day working day is an aspiration that fits in with the team's approach to balancing the economy for the workers as well as the overall industrialisation of the team."
Not the first Labour party to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working day during their 2017 general election campaign.
The ambition is currently not being supported by the Labour Party as a whole, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working day is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell says he is determined to return power to utility companies from "unknown directors" and "beneficiaries."
The shadow chancellor's plan means current shareholders of water companies may not get their entire share back because the labor government may give up something 'fortunate' because of the perceived wrong doing.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the company board and create an inclusive ownership fund to justify 10 percent of the employees of private sector companies, whose annual dividend stands at $500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and questioned whether the Bureau's findings could turn their backs on a Republican senator.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pally asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could discover something that led them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleagues in South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the incident, I called him, the complaint came out, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, unwavering."
Graham's vote, of course, seems to be irreversible.
“My mind has been made up about Brett Kavanaugh and a big, quite important complaint will need to be made to change that,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the name he said could not be verified.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that stars have a great line-up of performances and an equally impressive mission; the end of world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will not only see thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness to the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an expansion of poverty projects around the world, a group hoping to alleviate poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling to spread it internationally.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you’re not willing to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to work multiple jobs or “activities” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the global citizen remained for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert a real move to persuade people to take action, or another case of so-called "clicktivism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing an application online or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says these steps have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the team cited 390 commitments and declarations that started from its operations, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or funded.
The team estimates that the secured fund has so far directly impacted about 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementer partnership committed to "help children grow to their full potential," with a commitment to provide Rwanda with 35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a landmark in history," Tracey Woolman, Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The team also said that after more than 5,000 steps were taken in the United States to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced payments for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is, “What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movement before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Moni are among those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernandes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports
Washington may "necessarily" take refuge in its navy to prevent Russian fuel from coming to Middle Eastern countries, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Jink has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner's description.
Jink alleges that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to visit the new fuel market.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to broker power like Eastern Europe, Southern Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to take action against it.
"With our navy, the United States has the power to keep the sea route free and, if necessary, to block their fuel from entering the market," he said.
Ginke was speaking to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identifies as "the voice of fuel consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's use of Russia and Iran in real terms.
"Iran and Russia's financial options are less related to more energy benefits and replacements," he said, referring to Russia's "stabilized taps" with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The Trump administration's move was aimed at boosting the export of much cheaper liquefied natural gas to Europe instead of Russia.
Under its influence, U.S. President Donald Trump, including an official in the Trump administration, is himself trying to get Germany out of the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the USD 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline, is ready to take it to 110 billion cubic meters - a fully-fledged financially-saving project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing but financial and is an example of unequal competition.
"In my belief, we agree that energy cannot be used as a pressure tool and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Alexander Novak, Russia's Energy Minister, said after an interview with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has received a negative response from Germany, with Germany reaffirming its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kampf, said: "We have a major problem with the interference of a third state in our energy supply.
"Elizabeth Warren will look to "recruit" her 2020 presidential candidacy," Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seek out" a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
Warren, a town hall in Hollocke, Massachusetts, confirmed that he is in the race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top," she said.
"After November 6, I will be firmly in the presidential race."
During the Warren Town Hall debate, President Donald Trump said Trump was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote," Warren said in a tweet on Friday.
A poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters don't think he should run in the 2020 election.
The Boston Globe survey of political research centers at the University of Suffolk says that 57% of Massachusetts voters say they should not vote for a senator.
Thirty-two percent supported the fight.
The survey found that former governor Deval Patrick's vote was more supportive of the fight, with 38 percent supporting the potential fight and 48 percent not.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to be discussed in the 2020 vote include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested on Monday night for domestic violence.
"I understand other families who understand the consequences of PTSD and the trauma our soldiers are returning to," he told a gathering of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “at-home elephant”, and told his son and other war-experts that “they came back a little changed, they came back stronger, they came back to think, do they have any respect for colleagues who have given the army and the air force and other members of the military to the country?”
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department, a woman was accused of domestic violence, carrying weapons and being drugged.
18 states, DC support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges to the new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims of gangs or domestic violence.
To support a asylum seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
He said his accomplices "and his violent gang members boys" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys from the states supporting Grace cited examples of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as countries with widespread gang and domestic violence problems, from which a large number of applicants came to the U.S. for asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Immigration Appeals Board's 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum for fleeing domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy had "ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
The Friend-of-the-Court brief states that “the application of all refugees under this federal law should be judged according to certain facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates the main purpose.”
In the statement, attorneys also argue that the policy denying immigrants entry is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and that they "provide the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Those who have had to leave their own country due to persecution or fear for membership or political opinions in a particular social group or race, religion, nationality or religion can be accommodated," Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Shelter is never meant to solve all the problems - even all the deadly ones - that people face every day around the world.
Double the number of dead and dying in the midst of the rescue efforts of the living
It was a terrible situation for the survivors.
“It was very worrying,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma at the Palu City Shelter Centre, who asked her to comfort her fevered baby.
An ambulance is coming every minute.
There's no clean water."
In an effort to save what was found in the accumulated water, residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and others were rushed to hospitals with a magnitude of 7.5.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, whose back and shoulder bones were broken, have been kept outside the Palu Army Hospital, undergoing treatment under the sky due to a strong aftershock.
He cried when he was in a five-storey hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save them.
"I was stuck in the middle of a broken wall, I think," Harris told a media representative, adding that they had come to the city for a wedding ceremony.
"I hear my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to him or his children.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "disgusting" through "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US daily, citing the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to carry out a purposeful campaign.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited Iowa's largest Chinese daily Des Moines Register's paid supplement and accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, a charge China denies.
Trump alleged that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election, which U.S. officials told Reuters was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is natural that foreign governments will advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has led to increased tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts said that China's retaliatory tariffs in the early part of the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in an article in Sunday's Des Mines Register that China "has now doubled that barbarity with purposeful advertising in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the immoral history of American freedom of speech and the cherished history of the free press in this propaganda campaign by advertising payments in the Des Mines register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the newsstand on the side of the streets of Beijing, you will find limited anti-voting voices, and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's disagreements about China's worrying economic path, because the news media is here in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that his writing "rejected to print a major newspaper in China", although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans want to keep women voters away before the midterms in the Kavanaugh debate, analysts warn
The Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has stood up to multiple allegations of sexual harassment by many top Republicans and has warned analysts that they will see an adverse reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment has finally grown, and it appears that most Republicans are already willing to go ahead with the vote publicly.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill that “they cannot come back.”
Rihar said there was doubt as to whether pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would calm angry voters at the last moment for the FBI investigation.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and also in November," senior adviser and national women's spokesman Karen Jean-Pierre, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, during the decision of the Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee on Kavanaugh's nomination to go ahead, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a protest in the Senate hallway on Friday morning. Mike said.
"Democratic political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be a thing of the past."
"People are saying there's too much already; it's true.
But it could be even more so, especially among the elite female voters in the suburbs and among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don’t vote often because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford testified publicly about allegations of sexual abuse against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there could be an adverse reaction if Republicans proceed with the approval.
"This has become a complex issue for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about whether the committee vote or the final vote or the Kaffnaff should be left behind, it's about how Republicans have taken the issue and used it," the pro-choice USA group, which supports Democrats in the vote, told its director, Guy Sessell.
However, Americans seem to be a little confused as to who to trust in the testimony of Fords and Kavanaugh, with the latter taking a heavy toll.
A new study by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they believe in Kavanaugh.
It was also found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Fleck's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and Deborah Ramirez, a minimum of one of the plaintiffs, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee last week that he was molested by Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party while she was studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to fight with Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This is the latest project of the technology legend, Inript, a company that will create Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid gives users the right to choose where their data will be stored and which data will be allowed to be accessed by humans.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real purpose of Inraft was "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create a P&D or "personal online data store" using Solid's technology.
These can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it will depend entirely on the user - who can access the information of any kind.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea will help bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to get everyone's solids.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a team of some contracting on-staff developers and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inript's website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking about "whether or not they will launch any complete changes with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed overnight."
"We don't ask for permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inarap's "aim is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee radically changed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a strong voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm optimistic about the next era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Celebrating the Victoria Cross Cleric of the First World War
The city celebrates the Centenary of the Church of England's only priest who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Van Award was won on 29 September 1918 during the invasion of Belangalis and Lehancott.
However, he was killed by an assassin four days later, and he never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons unveiled his memorial at a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely significant" that the monument was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's death.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van "led his battalion through dense fog and fierce gunfire from the field and machine gun" during the de Saint-Quentin Canal parade.
He then rushed to the firing line and led the line with "maximum courage", only to sing a field song and knock out three enemies.
Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German assassin on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “something I could never have done and which is a tremendous honor.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuchkawz, then placed the wreath, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "deeply honored to be part of the parade" and added that "a true hero's heroism is being demonstrated in support of a large number of people."
MMA fans woke up all night to see the 206 Belloto, but instead they got Pepa Pig.
Imagine that you woke up the whole night to watch a great ballet 206 and the main event was not shown.
The original card of the bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK all night.
At 6 a.m., while Gagard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed to Pepa Piggy and shocked viewers in the UK.
They were up early in the morning because of this fight, so some people were angry.
On Twitter, a fan described the children's cartoons as "a kind of dirty joke."
"They were forced to change children's cartoons because they were not fit to be shown at 6 a.m. in accordance with government rules," said Belato's senior vice president Dave Schwartz in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, Yes"
Scott Koker, the president of the Belto company, said that he would work to make a schedule for future UK audiences.
"We might be able to fix it," said Coker.
"It's six in the morning and we can't do it until Monday.
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when it was switched on, there were a lot of messages coming in and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
But no, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll reduce it to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- in an attempt to give the fans extra.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Disc: Tom Deli suffers from "humiliation" due to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he suffered from low self-esteem when he was growing up - but that has inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said she didn't understand until she went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Lavren, she said she spoke about gay rights in giving others "hope."
She also said that after the birth of the child, her worries about winning the Olympics have diminished.
Christie Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as disgruntled at Lavren's first show, Deli said she felt "smaller" than the rest, because "the choice of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said: “To this day, it remains real to feel that small and to feel different, which has given me the strength and determination to succeed.”
She said she wanted to prove herself as "something one" so that when everyone knows about her sexuality, they don't get disappointed.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics has become a high profile LGBT campaigner and has used her presence to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said that he opened his mouth, because he felt lucky to have survived in public without complications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
This three-time world champion talked about falling in love with a man—American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013—which “surprised me.”
Deli married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her. She said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you faced so much at such a young age" - he went to the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died three years later of cancer - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had seen so many climbs in his life.
The couple gave birth to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and Deli said his "whole point of view" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have said ‘I have to win a gold medal’.
"To be honest, there's more to it than an Olympic gold medal.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Deli said her father never admitted that he was going to die and he finally asked if their tickets for London 2012 were confirmed - because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I never said, ‘You’re not going to sit in the first row anymore,’” he said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and held it until he took his last breath and died and I did not confess that he was not invincible," she said.
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"It's been a dream of mine all my life - to dive into the Olympics in front of my audience, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired her choice of her first song - Heather Small's Proud - which resonated with her in her preparation for the Olympics and which still resonates with her.

Mickelson will sit on the bench at Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to return his form if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played in the biennial event a record 12 times, had to sit on the bench at Saturday's Fourball and Foursome instead of Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the center of Halchal, which he used to play in the United States, the five-time major winner has spent his days working as a cheerleader and working to repair his game in the range.
Not always comfortable among drivers, even at the top of the career, this 48-year-old Tait Le Golf is not suitable for the National Course, where the tall raft often gets into trouble with long shots.
And if the course itself isn't bad enough, Mickelson, in the 9th match, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won all four of their matches this week in partnership with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four points below the start of 12 singles matches, can start well, Mickelson's match could prove to be important.
Faruq showed confidence in him, even though there was not much to say.
"Today he understands his role, puts his hand on my shoulder and says he's ready for tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been a great player and he's done a lot of things for the team this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought about moving forward.
He wants to get on the field, just like everybody else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most Ryder Cup matches in Sunday's match.
It could end up in a Ryder Cup career that doesn't even go through with his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven half-centuries in his possession, although Furyk says his presence is what excites the team.
"He's fun, he's smart, he likes to impress people, he's a team player and he's a great guy," he said.
"I think the new players have really enjoyed playing with him this week, which is great to see.
He gives so much more than just a game."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that even the big lead can disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that even the last day of the Ryder Cup with a major lead in the singles, the uncomfortable situation can arise.
Dane's debut came in 1997 in a match in Valdarama, where the team led by Savvy Ballesteros won by five points to the Americans, but only in the narrowest margin by somehow crossing the finish line at 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2- 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valparaiso; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valparaiso, where we won, but by a nominal margin," said Bjorn, who was seen in the picture, winning 5-3 in the 2018 class at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday, 10-6.
History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow is full of enthusiasm.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
It's not over until the board meets.
We have a goal, that's to try and win the trophy, and that's what we'll have the eyes of the bird.
I've always said that I look at the 12 players in my team, but I'm also very aware of who we are - the best player in the world."
Bjorn added, “I’m delighted with the work our players have done on the difficult golf course. “I’ll never be over-confident about it.
Tomorrow is a different battle.
Tomorrow will be a personal performance, and that's a different thing.
It's great to be with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're alone on the field, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
This message needs to reach all the players, who have to give the best of everyone tomorrow.
Now, you have to let go of your partner and get the best out of it."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponents Jim Furyk will be keeping an eye on the players who have played as a team to make themselves better, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have three points out of four.
As part of the defeat in the "Miracles of the Day" in Europe and the winning team in Brooklyn, Furik himself experienced dramatic change on the last day.
When asked about how captain Ben Crenshaw inspired his players before he got down on the last day of 1999, he said, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you'll want to get rid of fast starters like Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game is tilted to one side, there is a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
We're going to make a line-up and we're going to put the boys down the way we thought, actually we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
The top order, comprising Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, has been tasked with leading Thomas to the defence against the Europeans.
"I have arranged this team in this order, because I think it will cover everything," Bjorn said of his singles selection.
Germany's new warplanes are on the move again.
The T was scheduled to be launched in 2014 with the German Navy's newest team to replace the previous Cold War-era warships, but it won't be until at least next year due to faulty systems and the cost of snowballing.
The military spokesman was quoted by the Die Zeit newspaper as saying that the launch of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigate's first ship "Rheinland-Falz" has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been plagued by post-delivery problems.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 would replace the old Bremen-class frigate.
It is reported that they will have powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as ready-made radars, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it will be possible to deploy new frigates for a maximum of two years away from the country's port.
However, the continued delay means that state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to help Germany showcase energy abroad - will be outdated by the time they get into the water, Die Zeit reported.
The ill-fated F-125 frigate came under the heading last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ceremonial ship, sending it back to Hamburg's Bloom and Voss shipyards.
This is the first time a ship has been returned to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that would render the ship useless in battle.
The software's glitches are particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships will be operated by about 120 crews - half the manpower of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was overloaded which would reduce its performance and create obstacles in the way of adding future upgrades to the Navy.
This 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Falz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of crews, is also becoming a problem.
From an initial level of 2.2 billion pounds to an astonishing 3.1 billion pounds ($3.6 billion).
Troubled new fridges have become even more important in the wake of Germany's recent warnings of shrinking naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was “running out of a suitable vessel for the mutiny.”
The official said that the problem has been expansive over time, as no replacement ships have been brought in to replace the old ships that were canceled.
He regretted that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships had been able to join the Navy.
Listen to The Secret Life of Pets
New research is being carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands to learn how bats use landforms in search of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help in future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue their research with ordinary and soprano pipsarells and the Dobnton bats in Wester Ross's Inverview Garden.
Special recorders will be deployed at important places around the area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sound of all recordings and calculate the frequency of bat calls and report what species are doing.
A landscape map and report will then be created to create detailed landscape-scale images of their behavior.
Rob, a nature conservation consultant at NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to protect forests for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
They are in danger for building and development works that damage their sleeping space and habitat.
Wind-based turbines and lighting can also pose dangers, such as from some chemicals of flypapers and building materials, as well as from attacks by pet cats.
The mouse is not blind.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes when hunting at night due to the habit of hunting.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles on the flight path.
NTS, whose responsibility is to maintain more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to bats.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, visit places to sleep, and sometimes even rescues.
The company has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat conservation site on the Three Estates of Damfries and Gallo, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species reside.
David Thompson, the estate manager, said the estate is an ideal area for bats.
"There's a good area for three bats," he said.
"There are old buildings, there are many old trees, and there are all good habitats.
But much more about bats is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other places will help us understand more about what they need to survive.”
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before the property is maintained, as it may inadvertently destroy 400 female and child bats due to the destruction of a maternal home, and wipe out the entire number of local bats.
It is illegal for bats to be protected animals and to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrer, the Scottish officer on the bat conservation trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know much about how many species live.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and prosecutors are trying to bring charges against German newspaper
He called the rape allegations against him "false news", saying people wanted to "increase their acquaintance" with his name.
Her lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has made the allegation public.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mawrga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was accused of paying $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, according to the Der Spiegel report on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, described the reporter as "fake news" while speaking to his 142 million followers on his Instagram live video hours after the claim was made public.
"No, no, no, no.
"What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to know my name.
It's a normal thing.
They want to be famous, but it's part of life.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called an "unacceptable report to be taken as suspicious in matters of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schr<0xC3><0xB6>tz said the player must seek compensation "for moral damage in accordance with the importance of the breach, which is perhaps one of the most serious abuses of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's house after meeting at a nightclub, where he sexually raped her.
Mayorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo politely told him that he was disappointed with "99 percent" "good people", "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that they have had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that he went to the police and was photographed with his injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court because he was "terrified by the fear of retribution" and was "outraged in public."
The 34-year-old said she now wants to raise the settlement because she is mentally disturbed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the middle of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crime and joined Juve, Italy's famous club, in a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ losing its position as a car manufacturer
Commerce Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it lost its position as the world's first car maker after Brexit.
He also said it was "worrying" that Toyota told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker has said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, people could lose their jobs due to border delays.
Bernstone's factory - which manufactures Toyota Orice and Avenes - produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the EU countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory could be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernstone.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW said it would shut down its mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern that car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with the controls coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for the vehicle ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border disruption that could lead to a delay in shipments and a crisis in shipments.
The company said it was not possible to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at the Toyota Derbyshire plant, which could lead to a halt in production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will not only sustain success, but it will also allow us to enjoy the possibility of future improvements,” he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers are proving that it is very important to continue the successful system of supply chains.”
Unable to say how long Toyota will stop production, they have warned that overtime costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and result in many jobs being lost.
Peter Suvalris, who has been working at Burnston for 24 years, and the plant’s Unite Union convener, said its members are increasingly concerned: “Once these things are gone in my experience, they don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We need to have a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed further.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "given another week behind" amid tensions over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosestein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the election, the relationship between Trump's aide and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice.
In the past few months, Trump has been campaigning in Washington over whether to dismiss the deputy attorney general and question Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosestein discussing the use of secret Mike to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, it was reported that he had visited the White House on Monday in the wake of reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, while Trump was in the U.N. office in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to sack Rosestein, but that the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, for which the full Senate vote was further delayed.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding his meeting with Rosestein, he said: "There is no exact date, it could be this week, it could be a week later for all other current issues in the Supreme Court."
"I always want to see the news."
Some journalists will oppose the statement, with Sanders not holding any more press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said the reason for not holding the briefing was not to “show people” annoyance to journalists, although he said: “I don’t deny that they’ve done a thing about showing people.”
He also called for more direct communication between Trump and the press.
“The current president holds more Q&A sessions than any previous president,” he said without citing any evidence: “We’ve judged that number.”
"But if the media gets a chance to ask a direct question to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We've been trying very hard to do it, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and we're going to take the place of press briefings and talking directly to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends opening sessions or press conferences with prominent guests.
There is very little press conference.
This week in New York, the president is likely to show why unplanned work and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the press team.
Health Minister NHS Scotland writes to EU workers over fears of Brexit
The health minister expressed the country's gratitude to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland and expressed their desire to remain in the post-Brexit period.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised EU citizens to meet the set-up status application costs to work in the country's government services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Brexit talks between the UK and the EU continue throughout the summer, which is expected to result in the autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible non-aggression pact.
I know you all are going through a difficult time.
For this reason, I would like to remind you once again how valuable their contribution is to me irrespective of the nationality of each member of the staff.
Co-workers from all over the European Union and beyond have brought valuable experiences and skills that have strengthened and improved health services and benefited patients and our communities.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here.”
Christian's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee's Mike Organ said Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and became a bit of a jerk," said Reid.
The trainers and medical staff provided oxygen to the sideline and later brought him back for further tests.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that this time around, Vanderbilt was out of surgery at the medical center.
Harris added that "there are still no details known about the type/type of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
A second-year student wearing a red shirt after moving from Illinois is playing his first season with the State of Tennessee.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, with a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK.
When foreign buyers buy new property in the UK under the Tory plan, they will have to pay more stamp duty and this extra money will be spent on helping the homeless.
This move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
These stamp duty increases will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise incomes by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent helping the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters, with more affordable housing supplies and higher incomes being targeted.
The stamp duty increase will apply to individuals and organizations who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used by the government to help the homeless.
Surcharge - In addition to the current stamp duty, which was imposed on the second house two years ago and the rental house at a higher rate, could be more than three per cent.
The Treasury expects this to increase revenue by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly built total assets are bought by residents outside the UK, for which prices have risen and the situation has become more difficult for first-time home buyers.
Most of the country's elite regions - especially the capital - are becoming an "unknown city" in a crowd of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help the younger generation buy their first home.
She accused the big construction companies of raising property prices by not buying land and calling on Ms May to cancel the affordable house quota to solve Britain's "residence problem."
Mr Corbyn announced an interesting series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and the end of "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the restoration of the British dream - which is that life should be more beautiful for everyone in the new generation.
This means the collapse of the housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it may not be right that foreign and foreign non-governmental organizations that do not live in the UK will buy property as easily as hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has been left far away, and the problem of homelessness remains a very real one.
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate dream is to take charge of Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said that his "last ambition" is to become manager of Scotland someday in the future.
The 42-year-old Scotland resident, currently enjoying the challenge of recovering the North-East club, who are now in third place in League One, three points behind the first team.
St. Mary's returned to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for the country as a player.
I got a B-cap and so far," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father as a child and it always pulls me back.
This opportunity can only come if I succeed in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as a Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not disappointed by the rejection of offers from big clubs such as Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at the moment will be 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
"It's definitely worth the Premier League because of the structure and facilities at this club," he said.
“It’s not so easy to get there, but I’ll probably see myself as successful if I can get the club back there.”
Ross's manager life is currently only three years old, after 15 months as an assistant boss and coaching staff at Dumbarton.
He then helped Aloysius recover from the fall to the third level and convert St. Mirren from the fall to the championship title winner the following season.
And Ross said he's now more comfortable here than Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton's academic playing career.
"It was probably a real milestone," she recalled taking charge of the lighting.
"I really believed that management is better for me than sports.
It’s strange to hear it because I’ve done it right, lived a full life from it and enjoyed some success.
But it's hard to play
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about work pressure, but management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now that I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing on my own skin in my entire adult life."

According to the study, Saturday at 5.30 pm is the best time for pints.
Summer heatwaves have increased crowds in Britain's smoky pubs, but have put pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent in July - but the collection of restaurant money fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics published.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant company, who compiled these figures, said: "The constant sunshine and England's unexpected long participation in the World Cup means that the same trend will continue in July as in June, when pub sales grew 2.8 percent and restaurant sales declined.
Restaurant business declined by 1.8 percent in June to worse in July.
The main pubs and bars have done very well so far and the sale of restaurants has been as bad.
Food major pubs are also suffering from the heat, but not as well as restaurants selling them down.
It seems like people are just going out for a drink.
All pubs and bars saw a 6.6 percent increase this month, with food sales falling by three percent.”
Paul Newman of Retirement and Hospitality Analyst R.S.M. said: “The trend for the end of April is still continuing.
Weather and major social or sporting events have the greatest impact when it comes to selling on the market outside the home.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent reduction on sales each year will be particularly painful.
The long and hot summers for food major operators can’t come at a bad time and only time will tell whether the mild weather of August will bring some relief.”
In July, total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent, reflecting a drop in sales at brand roll-outs.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sector's Cofer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million, and is an established industry standard.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide with their parents.
The study revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The study showed an increase in the number of "fake insta" pages among 20,000 secondary school students.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-two percent of students say they have a "major" account to show their parents
One in five children - some just 11 years old - are creating a social media account hidden from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, the "fake insta" - the photo-sharing site Instagram - showed a rapid growth trend.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-two percent of the students said they had a transparent "main" account to show their parents, as well as a hidden one.
A mother, who looked at her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site, saw a teenage girl calling for others to "rap me."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headteachers Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admitted to having a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Elyse Doyle will be the "Voice for Athlete" on the Scottish Athletic Board
At the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body, Elih Doyle has been elected as a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive director.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman, Ian BT, described the move as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community, and we are confident that bringing her to the Athletics Board in Scotland will greatly benefit her," he said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as a voice for athletes and I’m hopeful that I can really help Scotland’s sport and take it forward.”

He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor told me I would be able to recover.
It was hard work, but now I'm healthy, I've learned to walk again and I've started exercising again today!
Thank you for the inspiring message!"
The Internet Is Different Than Mothers and Daughters
A breast pump company has split the internet's opinion with an ad that compares baby mothers to milked cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is called the "world's first noiseless breast pump," consumer technology company LV has released a funny music video to showcase the freedom the new pump gives modern mothers.
Four real mothers dance to a song on a straw-filled cow, with lyrics that include: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If anyone doesn't see, they're not a bunch of animals, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump and pump, pump and repeat, I feed the children, pump and repeat, I milk my girlfriends."
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
The video received a mixed response from viewers with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Many have said it highlights the “horribleness” of the dairy industry.
"The use of cow in advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and have a baby to produce milk, the difference is that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "This is obviously disappointing for both the mother and the child.
But why shouldn't breast pumps be used in advertising for mothers who care for their babies?"
Another said: "Extremely uncomfortable advertising."
While others stand by the ad, a woman admits that she likes the song "pleasant."
"I think that's a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would have one.
I feel like a sheep when I'm shooting.
It's kind of crazy, but I've done it well.
"It's an innovative product," he said.
Another commented: “It’s a funny ad she’s made to target mothers who pump (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and think of themselves as “guts.”
This ad does not praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women say they all danced with the pump hidden in their bra.
The advertisement is based on the idea that many women feel like a cow when they are pumping breast.
Although the LV pump is completely noiseless, it does not have its own or tube and fits nicely into the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to walk, hold the baby in the lap, and even go outside while pumping.
Anna Ballerine, Mother’s partner and ECD, said: “The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should start courageously and exhilaratingly.
Drawing parallel images of women and dairy cows we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, revealing the incredible feeling of release that the new pump will bring in in an entertaining and related way.
The LV pump is not in the news for the first time.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother of two used this product to walk the catwalk for designer Marta Zakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's stringent rules and policies have made it more difficult to keep children near their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are afraid of losing the chance to live in their own country by claiming immigrants and children without documents.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family would have to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of orphaned children.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no past criminal history.
"About 80 percent of the sponsor's or sponsor's family members are in the country illegally and a large part of them are Bidshy criminals.
"We're still looking for them," said Nietzsche.
In an effort to bring children back to society more quickly, officials have introduced some new rules, including requiring them to appear in court within a month of their detention, which was 60 days earlier, asylum-seekers said.
Many will appear before the immigration judge via video conference calls instead of in-person during their cases for legal status.
Those who are found to be incompetent will be quickly removed.
According to the shelter staff and reports released from the system in recent months, the more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape.
Supporters say the concerns are more acute in large centres such as Toronto, where children who are more concerned are more likely to be ignored because of their size.
They also said that if the children were moved to the center without being mentally prepared or having enough time to say goodbye to friends, many could have the trauma multiplied so that they are already suffering.
The U.S., France and Turkey have called on "smuggling forces" to immediately withdraw from Syria.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called for the return of Syrian refugees, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Molaym, who is also the country's deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on the soil of the country on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate action."
"They have to leave now without conditions," he told the council.
Molaym stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight until all Syrian territory is cleared" against both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the question of refugees, Molaym said the situation was conducive for their return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that have prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help make this return," he said.
"They're dealing with a global problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political deal is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib has provided an opportunity to move forward through political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey deal has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, where three million people live.
Molaym, however, insisted that the deal had a "clear timeline" and hoped that the military action would work against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eliminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura expects to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mo<0xC3><0xAF>se said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution," and warned against unwanted interference.
Why Trump's going to win the second round
In this argument, Trump will win the 2020 re-election, as a large number of liberals are likely to expect his presidency to end prematurely because of impeachment and scandals.
That would be "the most dramatic end of a president!"
So far, there is no sign of changing the views of the audience.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to about 1.05 million, and in the case of MSNBC, it has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News' average prime-time audience grew from 1.7 million last year to about 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Mado Show" tops the ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
About a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack, Neil Baer, the director of the ABC drama "Desegrated Survivor," said, "It's a fire that's attracting people, because it's beyond our comprehension."
There is another theory in the works of veteran comedy writer Neal Schovel and "Just the Funny Parts: and some of the Hidden Hard Truths of the Hollywood Boys Club."
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asks.
"Because she's funny," Ms. Scowell said to me.
There is also some entertainment value in this mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the issues that emerge from Washington can determine the future of Roe Five. Wait to see if immigrant families can reunify and what the state of the global economy is like.
Turnover is a luxury that is only within the capacity of the most privileged audience.
And despite that, a conscious citizen’s understanding will go out of hand when you see a panel of experts arguing for hours over the use of “deep background” for Bob Woodward’s “Fearful” book, and the $15,000 camel-skin bomber jacket used by Paul Manafort (Washington Post) with a description of Mr. Trump’s “mast dress” and Mr. Trump.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario again.
Regarding the Trump show’s daily rotational cast and daily plot changes (along with the fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un), Wheelhouse Entertainment’s chief executive and creator of “Pon Stars” Brent Montgomery said, “Some parts of what he’s doing is like a reality show, every night he’s doing something funny.”
You can't miss a single episode.
When I spoke to Mr. Fliss this week, there was 80 sunny weather outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but despite that, he was sitting at home watching MSNBC on CNN recordings.
He could not find himself in the clutches of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee and his future hanging by the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do great shows on those days and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flies told me.
"I thought it was going to be a joke, but it's real."

In the mid-term elections, money has entered the country like a flood.
It's not surprising that the money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th vote, as two candidates are fighting for a single seat, courtesy of the Congressional District's redistricting.
The newly restructured downtown Pittsburgh District pits Arera's Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won another district seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, much of which is part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally formatted in favor of Republicans, which led to the redesign of the map.
This election battle for the new 17th district has engaged the main parties in a money-laundering contest between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made his mark in March after winning the widely-publicized special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been under Republican control for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political pundits are making little headway with the Democrats.
U.S. sentences El Salvador to death for supporting China
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, retreating slightly from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also had a hotel in Panama, but later the partners removed the Trump Organization's directorial team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that office officials had decided to bring back American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, with "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan any more."
However, only El Salvador, who received nearly $140 million as U.S. aid in 2017 in the drug-trafficking, development and economic assistance sectors, was fined.
The proposed penalty, which included scuttling financial aid and certain visa restrictions, could have been painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rate.
As the internal meeting progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a move to prevent immigrants from crowding into the U.S. like last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending the possibility of El Salvador's execution.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in which the administration will deliver a message on imports.
And the American ambassadors of the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on statements made by three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal affairs on condition of anonymity.
His statement was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and he also declined to be named.
Read History
The next inevitable event could be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has enough evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's investigation is turning to whether Mr. Trump had any ties to Russia during the election.
If the hands of Congress change, Mr. Trump will have to take his responsibilities, just as he is preparing to go to the polls again, and he may eventually have to go to court with his colleagues.
There are many if-buts, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or that his European complement.
It will be the choice of the inhabitants of the two coasts of our Atlantic for how long this dispute will last.
In 1938, German officials might have "rescued" Hitler, unless the West stopped him and stood by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid assassination for many years.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and in it the overwhelming speed of democracy is sometimes accelerated, sometimes delayed.
This has also happened in American history.
What should we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger since it was published on paper last year that he secretly suggested recording the president's speech and speculated about his inability to hold a position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times' report was false.
"What will happen if our probe into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is found innocent in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
The big question is, will we elect a Congress that can hold Mr. Trump accountable in the midterm elections?
If we fail this test, democracy will go to sleep for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was once exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who occupied my embassy.
He survived, fled to America, and, 60 years later, Swastika sent me to the table with signs to light the lamp of Sabath.
With this history, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorans hopeful ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
The Rangers will play their own Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning against the Austrians after a great draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, giving them a good chance to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorans played his first match of the season due to a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes they will be able to get to a better place by relying on this result.
"This point is very important, because Villareal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field with confidence and took a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, draw tie seems to be a fair result.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
Thursday is another important night in Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but I am sure with the support of the audience we can get positive results.
Last year was not very good, due to my injury and all the changes that have taken place in the club, there are elements of feeling good in the current position.
Our team is also very good and the boys are also having a great time.
"I am hopeful that we can move forward and succeed by leaving behind the last season."
Women are losing their sleep at night to save for retirement.
Despite the fact that participants in the study had an idea of how to deal with it, very few individuals spoke about it with their family members.
Half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action for this conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Know where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t express your wishes well enough in advance, you can’t prepare your family for your ministry.
Work by keeping in touch with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you want to receive care, as the cost of your choice is also very important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can look for solutions to address these costs.
Your financing choice for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, if you have money - a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help with these costs or self-insurance with your own assets.
Resolve from your legal documents: Try to stay away from legal battles.
Take a proper health care proxy so that you nominate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and so that the professional can comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think of a power of attorney for your property.
Choose a reliable person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bill is paid properly when you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little things: Remember that your elderly parents are in need of emergency treatment and are being taken to the hospital.
Are you aware of your current health and safety concerns?
Keep these things in a written plan so that you can be prepared.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Palu city on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll could rise further after the quake.
As communications were cut off, rescue officials were unable to report on the Dongla Regency area north of Palu, which is located near the epicentre of the 7.5-scale quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been rescued after the disaster.
Some important information about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
The capital of the state of Central Sulawesi is Palu, which is located at the end of a narrow creek on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongala is a regent that spans about 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The state has an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main sources of economy in the state of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the state, but most of them are located in Morowali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's disaster management agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed about 200 people in Dongala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is often hit by earthquakes as it is located in the Pacific region of volcanic activity.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal area of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005 - A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006 - A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami to hit dozens of villages and kill nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the PD Jaya Regency in Aceh, triggering devastating and frightening memories of the 2004 tsunami.
Although there was no tsunami, more than 100 people died in the collapse of their homes.
2018: A major earthquake strikes the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Alaska's governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son has been charged with assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin has been arrested in Alaska on charges of domestic violence and attempted to avoid arrest.
According to the police report, when a known woman went to call the police in the wake of the incident, she took the phone away from her.
Palin has been placed on an unsecured bond of $500 in the custody of the Matt-Su pretrial facility, KTUU said.
He was produced before a court on Saturday, where he was told by the network that he had claimed himself to be "confirmed innocent."
He has been charged with a Class A crime, which could lead to up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
And there are also allegations of class B crimes, which could result in a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal complaint has been filed against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Philippe.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police for the attack.
The case is currently being heard in the Texas Court of Appeals.
In January 2016, she was accused of domestic violence and of using firearms in domestic violence and drug abuse.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans Group criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to its PSTD service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that washed away thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake was felt near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video of the incident is going viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the shore, hundreds of people gathered to take part in the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect who was involved in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This rare sentence has not been given to anyone since 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Saipov, using a home depot rental truck, attacked in October on the way to the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, pushing cyclists and pedestrians.
According to a notice filed in the New York South District praying for the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Cypov was "deliberately" killing eight people and "deliberately" inflicting serious injuries.
According to the court documents, both of them are sufficient to execute the death sentence.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, including eight commonly associated with organized crime, with violence and car crashes.
Citing how Saipov carried out the "horrible, brutal and perverted" attack, the prosecutors said it required "adequate planning and prior guidance."
"Syphilo Habibullahevich Sypov whose family and friends are the cause of the injury, damage, and damage caused by the damage, are Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Claves, An-Laura Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Aleandro Mendoza, and Aleandro Dem Stateda."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last execution in New York South District took place over a decade ago.
Khalid Burns was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953, against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Cypov, a resident of Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse, according to the court report.
Police said they were happy after the incident.
Cypov told officials that he was inspired by an ISIS video on his phone at home, which is alleged to have carried out the attack.
Police said they had also requested that the ISIS flag be installed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than grant a life sentence will prolong the trauma of the incident among everyone involved,” said Patton.
Sipov's legal team had previously called for the death penalty to be abolished.
Tory said Nigel Farage should be given the responsibility of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "integrate the people's forces" at the Tory conference today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians "have been touched" by Eurosceptics - while Theresa May's own MP said she should be given the task of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have already been "out of the EU."
But the ice cream she's been eating to keep her deeply divided clergy in one place has become clearer once again, when she took part in another anti-Brexit protest in the city of Tories, anti-Brexit.
One of the most pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit watchers is trying to put the deal on the right track in the midst of the EU's attack.
His allies insist that despite the opposition, they must make a deal with Brussels - and force Europeceptics and Labour to choose between their package and the "disruption."
Mr. Solihale said at the Liv Mins Liv rally that he wanted 'chuck checkers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a colleague and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have come out in it," he said.
Wellinboro MP also said: “I will support Brexit, but Chuck Checkers is needed.”
In his speech to his opponents in the EU, he said: “We have not fought a war to live as a follower
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Sister has ruled out the possibility of changing public opinion after the 2016 vote. “The idea that the British people want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Andre Jenkins, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also at the march, who told reporters: “All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Checkers are the dislike of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and our party people and activists are also the dislike of those who have brought us here.
Checkers, hurry up and try to listen."
Addressing Ms May in a sharp tongue, she added: “The Prime Minister is thinking of his position where his promise should be kept.”
Mr Farage told the gathering that if the 2016 referendum decision was to be betrayed, politicians should be forced to understand the “disappointing situation”.
“It’s a matter of trust between politicians and people,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re going to tell them, ‘If you do that, we won’t let you escape.’”
To the cheering crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face an ugly situation.
“We are running a people’s army that has brought victory to our Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Anti-Brexit protesters held a two-hour march through the city centre in Birmingham.
Brexit banners have been displayed against the Tories since a team of workers was formed at the end of this week.
Labour leader Adonis mocked the Conservatives at the conference after suffering security issues on a party app.
“Some people are telling us that they can keep the border seamlessly, the free trade on the Irish border, Canada’s plus plus and the IT system right,” he added.
“It’s a full-scale operation.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is considering a "hard look" at running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be "deeply concerned" about running for president after the November vote.
The Boston Globe said the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in the western city of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has often been critical of President Trump, is fighting for the November re-election of G.O.P. State candidate Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There are rumors that he may run against Trump in the 2020 election.
It was the 36th meeting of its organizers at the Hollywood Town Hall on Saturday evening after Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him about being a presidential candidate.
"The time has come for a woman to lead our broken government," Warren said.
Man Arrested for Shooting at L.S.O.'s Sims
Baton Rouge, LA Police said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of LA basketball player Wade Sims.
Deton Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for the footage to be identified.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on Friday morning on the campus of Southern University.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that "Wood Sims was shot in the head," 247 Sports reported.
Wade was attacked by Simpson while trying to save his friend.
Simpson was arrested and admitted to being at the scene, found a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wade Simmons.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot 6-junior seams, who grew up in Baton Rouge, have played since the start of 10 matches and played a total of 32 matches in the last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title by relying on a gift from fellow teammate Sebastian Vettel
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday and said the Mercedes team's order would play an important role in the race.
Bates started well from the pole, almost ignoring Hamilton, keeping his position with the first two left, and invited Vettel to attack his own team player.
Vettel put Hamilton behind the crowd and put himself in the back of the crowd, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver pitted in the next lap and followed Vettel, but Hamilton moved on after the battle, leaving the Ferrari driver empty-handed with the risk of a double-moved chance.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday today and was number seven after the first lap.
He then took the first part of the race, followed by Kimi Raikkonen with a bad tire and took the fourth place.
He pitted 44 laps, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight laps, leaving Raiconen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri fought hard all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
"The team is doing a great job in the first place," Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally for not disclosing Christine Blaise Ford's letter to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accusing him of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the issue, but instead said that what was going on in the Senate showed the "low and ugly and false" mentality of the people.
"This is one thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the past few weeks, you'll see the anger, when you see the downtrodden and ugly and liars," he said.
"When they see the information, they will say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
Oh, I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, what have you been up to?
Remember the answer to your question: "Oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't catch it."
Hey, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he said.
The letter was sent to Ford Feinstein in July, describing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September—but Feinstein denied the letter had been leaked from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak anything," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret according to his word."
But he did not listen to the president, he opened his mouth at Saturday night's rally: "I said what happened, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a worse body language than that."
Speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They want power back at any cost.
"Look at the low mentality, look at the rudeness, don't let them hurt anyone, don't let anyone step in to get power and control," the president said.

Patrick Dyer scored two goals against Dandy for the Giants.
Dundee Stars beat Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League game to win the match back to back in Dundee on Saturday with a 5-3 win.
The Giants quickly went on to score two goals, courtesy of Patrick Dyer and Francis Beville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie came back to equalize for the home team and the Giants went ahead with Dyer's goal.
For Dundee, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised with Ferran and then Lucas Landvalt Nielson scored two goals.
This is the third loss for Adam Kiff's team in the Elite League, who came behind Belfast on Friday night and beat Dandy 2-1.
The two teams have met four times this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dyer's first goal came in the fourth minute of the game at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McPhail, he doubled Beavis' lead with the help of David Rutherford four more minutes later.
At the start of the game, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game with the help of Matt Markart at 13:10 and later at 15:16.
At the end of the first half, Dior scored his second goal to ensure the Giants advance.
The host team returned to the game and Buchanan again scored a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.

The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will next play against Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
Air traffic controllers saved hundreds of lives from the earthquake in exchange for their own
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been awarded the title of hero after he died while helping a plane with more than 100 passengers on board.
More than 800 people died on the island of Sulawesi on Friday in a tsunami caused by a major earthquake and many people are missing.
The area is repeatedly shaken by the strong following tremors and people are trapped in the debris in the palu.
But despite all the fellows fleeing for fear of life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Palu's Muttiyara did not leave the control tower on the horrifying runway of Sis Al Zufri Airport.
He went on to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to fly safely.
Then he jumped down in fear of breaking the control tower.
He later died in hospital.
Johannes Sirite, a spokesman for Indonesia Air Navigation, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported in Australia.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Palu this morning.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could drop to thousands, with the disaster management agency saying communications to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong have been restricted.
"The death toll is expected to continue to rise, as many bodies are trapped under debris that have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
A six-metre-high wave swept through Palu, where mass burials will be held on Sunday.
Relief and rescue operations are being carried out with the help of military and commercial aircraft.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The body is coming to the ambulance every minute.”
There is no clean water available.
Small markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly taking help from the living, but we don't know what to see there.
It's already sad, but the situation could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo told soldiers in Palu on Sunday: "I urge you to continue your day-and-night rescue efforts.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia's Lombok was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea says one missing in Legun plane crash
One of the airline's planes crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, where they previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a report on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was not found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
The airline declined to provide details of the passenger's age and nationality.
Some local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chak Island airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane went down in the water before it reached the runway.
A number of witnesses believed the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane went down very low.
"That's a good thing," Jensen said.
Jens said she and others crossed the waistwater and reached the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the crew members were screaming in terror and suffered minor injuries to their heads.
The U.S. Navy said a nearby jetty crew was also assisting in the rescue, bringing people to shore by a boat full of air before the plane sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but there have been no accidents in Air New Guinea.
Investigators have been able to find a woman who was burned alive.
The case was put to trial again on Saturday for the man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. judicial analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for several hours as an expert on intelligence analysis.
He describes in front of the jury how using a cellphone record made the night of his death by 29-year-old defendant Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett said she had recovered several cellphones that showed that the teles and chambers were together on the evening of the death, against the previous teleses, the Clarion laser report.
According to the information, his cell phone was with the Chambers at the time, although he confessed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police have spoken to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that night.
When the prosecutors asked if Teles was telling the truth that he was in his Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that “it was a lie because his truck was in Nashville that day.”
Another discrepancy is that Teles said she knew him two weeks before Chambers' death.
According to reports, the couple had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted text, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He got away with it," Haley said.
The final arguments in the case were held on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to court the next day.
The High Bride: What's the Concussive Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative thinking of the genre by sending a positive message within the music.
Bristol's The High Bride, however, insists that hip-hop has moved away from its political message and the mainstream of dealing with social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make Kansas hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Another black man?!
New York has filed a lawsuit against a couple for being fired after a "racist" Text.
A New York-based nanny is suing a related couple for discriminatory expulsion after he received a misleading text from a mother who called him "another black man."
The couple have denied the allegations of apartheid and have sought a case for "judgment."
Linsey Plasco-Falxman, the mother of two, expressed her disappointment after arriving on the first day of work in 2016 and found out that Giselle Morris, the baby's new caregiver, was a black man.
"Naaaaa another black woman," Ms. Plasco-Falxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, instead of sending it to her husband, twice.
Later realizing her mistake, the "disgusting" Plasco-Falxman fired Miss Morris. She said that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had expected a Filipino to act badly, according to the New York Post report.
Mrs. Morris was given a one-day mine and Uber was sent home.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation in the eviction case and seeking compensation for six months at $350 a day, although he was first hired as a home-based nanny without any contracts.
"I want to show them, look, this can't be done," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple opposed their apartheid claims, saying it was reasonable to dismiss Morris for fear that he could not be trusted after being charged.
"He didn't want to tell me what my wife sent me.
He is not racist.
"We're not a racist couple," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've wronged, even if they've done it wrong?"
Your unborn child?
Tell me."
Regarding the allegations of "judgment", Plasco said his wife had just given birth to the baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You want to fight someone like that?"
"It's not a good investment," he said.
In light of the ongoing legal case, the public court has strongly condemned the couple's behaviour and reasoning on social media.
The Paddington publication fears that readers may not be able to relate themselves to the talking bear, a new paper has revealed.
Bond's daughter Karen Janckel, who was born soon after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to tell what a first-time reader would think before they'd read it."
It's interesting to see the success of Patton.
Her father, who has worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting inspiration from little toy bears to write children's books, said she was optimistic about her work being rejected. She also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after her death last year was "sweet" to her.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not arrogant," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was as if your own child had achieved something: you're proud of him, even though you don't have any point in it."
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was the result of his own creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her way to death and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Naid would call regularly and say it's too bad, and he probably won't survive," Ms. Ednan-Laperoz said.
"Then I got Nad's call and found out he was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him by phone.
And that's what I do.
I said, "Dude, I love you.
I will come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines that the doctors gave to keep his heart running were gradually stopping working in his body and coming out of the body.
He died a short time ago and then it was over.
I had no choice but to wait.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - she was unimpressed by this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
“I was shaking my head, my eyes were watering constantly.
It's impossible to describe, but I was sitting on the plane with Ned's unjustified pain.
I need His love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
The woman posted a suicide note on the bridge.
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to suicide, work to stop the suicides of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries post cards with inspirational messages on the Welsh Bridge and put up phone numbers where people can call for help.
Mrs Davis' son, Tyler, died of depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm doing all the time," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef and had infectious smiles.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone would say, "The house lights up with her smile."
However, before he died, he quit his job, because he "actually went into darkness."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him dead.
Ms Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this effort will get bogged down.”
Mrs. Davis said, "Let everyone know that there are people you can talk to, and they can be friends."
Don't just sit there and talk.
Ms. Humphries, who has been Miss Davis's girlfriend for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He never said he was upset or depressed or anything else," she said.
A couple of days ago, I noticed a change in my mood.
"He was in a very bad condition on Christmas day - he didn't even close his eyes when the kids were opening their presents."
He said his death was a huge emotional blow to him, but he had to overcome it: "It created a huge vacuum in the family.
You've ruined us.
But we have to walk and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future under investigation by the FBI
“I thought, if we could give him some of what he wanted – since the time of the investigation is limited, the scope is limited – we could probably bring in some unity,” Mr Flake said Saturday. He also said that he feared that the committee might “break up” in the wake of this partisan stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their duties are related to time.
The midterm elections, November 6, are just five weeks away - if, as expected, Republicans yield bad results, their efforts to get the people of choice to the country's highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush is calling on senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House under Mr. Bush, through whom Mr. Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen to the FBI's report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow him to break the vice-president Mike Pence tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "falled" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Beyong-seg, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Integration, said the number of defectors last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China were the main reason for the money laundering and human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment on the matter.
A large number of defectors from North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than crossing the highly protected uninhabited zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - who are still actually at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they roughly agreed to work towards building a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Ri said, “If the United States does not have confidence in our national security, we will have no confidence in our national security, and we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves in the first place.”
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh “histeria-grieved”, saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "histria-disgusting" and said he was inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony, saying: "I could not have imagined that if a woman had ever done something like this, she would have been called a hysteria-stricken."
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Bleese when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his initial statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, screaming and holding his breath while talking about his family and high school life.
He categorically condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "provocative and provocative character" organized by the Liberals, alleging that this was being done out of anger at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is not eligible for the Supreme Court because it proves he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he has proved himself to be incompetent in the statement he made and in the way he has opposed Clinton and Democrats," he said.
When asked if Kavanaugh would be impeached if he was confirmed and Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi said she would be impeached.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only does he not deserve the Supreme Court, but he's also ineligible for the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals in DC.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act, or Roe v. Wade, as she herself is a Conservative Justice.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"It can't be allowed that a hysteria-ridden, biased person would go to court and tell us, 'Isn't that great?'"
Women need to control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger coming out, and he can't keep crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
"A woman executive helped me a lot, who used to say that she too would cry when she was angry. But she chose the way that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad, because I'm crying.'
I'm really angry."
Then he continued on.
I thought it was awesome."
Tears partially act as an expression of anger, as they are mainly prone to misunderstandings.
One of my sharp recollections of an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying out in incredible anger, was an old woman holding my scarf - a terrible manager I'd always been a little scared of - who dragged me up the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, then Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a fishing boat off the coast of Manki Business and ran out of competition for dirty work, deeply disappointed Ms. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der thought there was no reason not to be a candidate for his own presidency.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," he said, smiling after 30 years.
Seven other candidates are already in the fray, and no one wants another candidate.
One called it "snow white and seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was delayed at the beginning, he was lagging behind in fundraising and so he insisted that he would not run the race without collecting $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that if a supporter was given $1,000 to a man, he was only being given $250.
“Do they think I’ll get the price?” he wondered.
When he announced that he would not run an official campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude to his supporters, the frustration with the system made it difficult to raise money, he targeted voters with the exception of delegates, and became sick of anger about gender inequality.
"You might have thought I had a neurological disorder," Ms Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der said, recalling the media's prostitution.
"You may have thought that I'm a business owner.
I remember thinking, where are they going to bury me?
"She was crying?"""
How the U.S.-China trade war could go for Beijing
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade war was bitter, and when the war is over, Beijing could benefit in the long term, like experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year warned of tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant breakthrough has been this week, when almost half of the total imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (150 billion pounds), were placed on new tariffs.
Beijing has retaliated as it did every time - more recently, it has raised tariffs on US$60 billion worth of goods by five to ten percent.
China has decided to fight with eyes wide open and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to go down anytime soon.
It would be very insulting for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly bow his head to the United States.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play the cards properly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Any rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries, much more dangerous than the well-known fact," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think-tank organization that deals with Asia.
Syria is “ready” to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for the rebuilding of the seven-year-old war-torn country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mawlaym said the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation is stable and secure today because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate to restore normalcy in the areas destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is now favourable for the voluntary return of people who have been forced to leave the country due to the loss of their daily lives and livelihoods due to terrorism and the surrounding economic conditions.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people left the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Molayem said the Syrian government welcomed all support for the reconstruction of the country.
He, however, stressed that no conditional aid would be accepted, nor would any assistance be sought from countries supporting the rebels.
Winner of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The U.S. has beaten Europe six times in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Team Europe, led by Danish captain Thomas Beyonce, reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States and reclaim the title.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who did not play well for most of the tournament, hit his t-shirt in the par-3 16th hole, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari became one of only 1 in 4 to score above 5-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979, showing brilliant performances in all rounds.
American Jordan Spieth, Europe's lowest ranked player, has been beaten 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbjorn Olsen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Pollter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
Experienced in the eight-time Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio Garcia holds the most wins of all time in Europe with 25.5 career points.
I usually don't cry, but this time I can't.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you for believing in me and my choices.
I'm so glad I got my cup back.
"It's a success for the team, I'm happy that I was able to help," Garcia said.
He handed over the responsibility to his country’s John Ram, who defeated American legend golfer Tiger Woods in singles 2 and 1 on Sunday.
"I'm so proud to have lost Tiger Woods, I grew up seeing him," said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France, setting a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
This is an inconsequential statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles only after the top-ranked Jack Nicholson.
Teams in the U.S., excluding high-quality performance performers Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, have stumbled throughout the weekend.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of them, they fought.
This morning, we had a little bit of pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
"We're going to move on, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to respect them.
We didn't get into the game."
Updates of red currents: decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A new report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in the concentration of red currents in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the plume conditions in the counties of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolya have been observed - which is a sign of a decrease in concentration.
The Bloom of the Red Stream stretches over a coastline of about 130 miles from North Pinellas to South Lee County.
Patches can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but they have been less noticeable than last week.
The Red River has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week in Pinellas County, a moderate density off the coast of Hillsboro County, more than less than the coast of Manatee County, a bushy density on and off the coast of Sarasota County, a moderate density on and off the Charlotte County, a low density on and off the coast of Lee County, and a low density in Coelia County.
Respiratory problems are still being reported from the counties of Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of any respiratory problems from northwest Florida for the past week.
