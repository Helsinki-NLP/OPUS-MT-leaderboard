Welsh AM is worried about 'Specs' looks like masks'

This policy will include other changes in the Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, including laws and administrations of AMS.
When AM is discussing this law, they will not end up calling on what name they should be called.

John Edward: For global citizens, language skills are needed
The independent school of Scotland holds success in education, and in 2018 it has also been conducted, with a further parallel of the results of uncompromising experiments, including sports, music, music, and other social activities.
More than 30,000 students in all Scotland are represented by the Scottish Council of Indent Schools (SCSS), which is a stimulus for their students and parents.
The free school students set the goal of preparing their students for their next and high school education, for their chosen career, and for their worldwide career as a global citizen.
As a result of the prevalence of pre - school education as a field, schools are considering modern - day languages as a subject of popular and unequivocal interest.
“ If you speak to a man in his language, he will go straight to his head, ” said the Nielsen Congregation.
"If anyone speaks the word of a man with a tongue, he will even enter into his heart.
One important thing is to keep in mind that we cannot rely only on English to establish relationships and trust in other countries.
As recent tests of Hindi show, the top position is on the list of high - speeded Kingdom Halls throughout the United States. In the United States, for example, the number of Kingdom proclaimers worldwide has grown to some 12,000.
A 68 percent of the students who learned a foreign language received a high grade.
The data stored from the ACS' 74 members showed that 72 percent of students got high grade, and the number of German students was 62%, and the number of those who learned French was 69 percent and the number of Spanish students who were learning A.S.A. was 63%.
This shows that the freedom schools in Scotland support foreign - language skills that will require children and young classes in the future.
The language is now considered to be the subject of free school studies and is now considered to be the subject of stEM (scientific, physiological, engineering, and mathtics).
In 2014, U.S.A. for business and technology, the U.S.A. noted that the number of languages in which the language was affected by the use of 17 percent of the language skills.
As a result, more and more languages are needed to prepare for their future assignments.
In the United States, for example, the number of Kingdom publishers in the United States has increased by over a quarter of the world’s population.
If they have learned another language in such a way, they can have a real purpose in life.
As a result of the ability to communicate directly with people in foreign - language groups, it may be the most popular in the race.
According to the United Nations Universal Declaration of more than 4,000 adults in Ukraine in 2013, 75 percent of people were unable to speak in a foreign language, and only 15 percent were allowed to speak French in the second language.
This is what makes the language so important for children today.
If there is a wide variety of languages, especially in developing territories, the children will have good opportunities to make good use of meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus more on modern languages, but others teach other languages that are considered the most important thing for Greece, such as Manadin or Japan.
No matter what interest your child may have, there are many languages to choose in independent schools, and a well - trained teacher class to teach in related areas.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to provide a educational environment that will equip students to make, and they will be able to make the most of what they can do in the future.
A global community cannot deny this fact because language is important to the future, so it must be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be considered "international skills".
This choice will continue for the young people of the Free School for Single Schools, diversity, and excellent qualities.

Michaelson, seven times in this binary unit, playing 12 times, and playing as an extra-superving game for all the peoples and for those who were involved in the francs.
Instead of being actually involved in sports, as he has always been doing for the United States, this five - hour tour of the game has encouraged him to encourage him and to focus on the purpose of removing the causes of his game.
Even though his career has never been the most direct driver in his career, 48 - year - old Michael is not the ideal for a full - time trainer, where the long long - term part never apologizes.
And if the course is not the only challenge, the British winner in the New York Times will face France’s Frenchmanship on Sunday, which has been organized to win all four of this week.
