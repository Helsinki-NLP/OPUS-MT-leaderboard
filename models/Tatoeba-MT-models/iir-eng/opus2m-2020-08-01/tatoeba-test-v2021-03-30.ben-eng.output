Tom's too tired.
I'm busy.
You can go home this time.
He's younger than me.
I think Tom's good.
I'll go back to Australia for two days.
Tom told Mary he was going to kill himself, but he didn't have the courage to do it.
Are you going to catch us?
Although it's not bad itself, in many cases, many have seen a lot of television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count yet.
See you drive.
I'm eating.
I don't want to do that alone.
How far is the station from here?
He got sick last week.
Tom hit the door on the door, but no one came out.
He's a doctor.
Stop dragging.
I'm hurt.
Go to the hospital.
The messenger came back.
Please continue.
It's broken.
Tom always keeps his word.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I deny it.
Wait outside.
I need a taxi now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
This happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We'll try once!
Tom's tired.
Don't forget what we're talking about.
Tom kept talking.
I've been on the south.
It's so tired to see you.

He's hungry.
Last week, you got sick and sick.
I'll see you next month.
We need to contact Tom's parents.
Where can I buy that magazine?
I'll be back seven times.
Is that serious?
I was late.
Call Tom.
How much?
Tom saw him.
How long did your plane take?
Tom's long, but he's not too long.
She's my wife.
I'm not very good at swimming.
Where's the President's office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't call me his name.
Okay, I'll see you again.
Are you here?
What happened?
Rs.100 with home's pay tanks.
I'm not good at French.
My father's going in China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get out of this ship.
That's Tom.
He's not yet here.
Kim's just laughing.
I'm not in town.
Women change the world.
Let's take a look at it.
I don't want Tom to see me in this condition.
Tom started screaming.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It's going to be worth it.
Start here.
We're waiting for them.
I like yellow color.
Tom's right to keep a driver.
He doesn't eat anything except the fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you screaming?
Can I get a little check?
Do you have something bigger than that?
Tom brings me double from me.
That's what I need.
I think you don't need any help.
Tom was waiting outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is that magic open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about my business.
Shall we eat outside today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's injured.
He's moving.
Is my Londoner's cloth ready?
Where can I buy it from?
I need to send a fax.
She's too much.
He taught me to write.
Call my ass.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
We're our docs.
The rules are easy.
Can you keep watch over Tom?
You're very good from me.
He hasn't come yet.
I can't cut my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom got the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Do you understand me?
Tom was surprised when I heard that Mary Ari was married.
In most cases it depends on effort.
Tom's so happy.
Tom got his head off.
Did you be born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Do you have this flight?
What do you think?
It's broken.
Can I get a knife?
Have you ever broken your bones?
I want to go to the next stage.
How are you?
I'll go to the doctor tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Is that what?
He hasn't come yet.
They're doctor.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Are you ever on the horse?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
What is this about you?
I didn't have to tell Tom anything.
Try more.
Tom walked.
Why are you sitting there?
In what language does the United States speak?
I'm tired.
He has two daughters.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always keeps his word.
He's an expert teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom here.
Everyone wants happiness.
I forget your phone number.

How long did he leave for the seatel bus for airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if it's time to do it.
Tom keeps his word.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some oil.
Tom's gone.
You go first.
We've all eaten dinner.
It'll start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Where's it down?
football is a game.
The sky is clear.
No, no, no, no!
I really appreciate your generosity.
He told me he was going to Venus.
What's your phone number?
He's walking.
What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Am I too late?
Leave him.
I can't say exactly.
A media of language holo communication.
Tom knows that.
I'm never listening to Tom.
How long did the next train leave for Tokyo?
Tom's getting a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to run away.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not yet here.
I'm sorry!
You have a lot to say to me.
The snow reflects on Roshmi.
Come out.
They shouted.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for the first time.
You don't have a bicycle?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're screaming.
He's kerosene.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll let my little girl eat breakfast morning and morning.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please keep my voice clean.
Do what he says.
It's so tired to see you.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today's June 18 and Myriall's birthday.
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We're gonna have to let Tom do this for us, right?
Can you find these pictures in your own hands?
I'm going to Oska Station.
I don't think Tom's responsible for it.
Someone's a chlo.
I went to bed.
I've learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's take a look at it.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used.
I'm scared.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm screaming.
My hands don't work properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is that a Tom book?
She was angry.
Who are you?
I could die.
Are you sure?
This time we have to go.
He's neglecting the school.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's easily suffocating his head.
Wherever he goes, his dog will follow him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
I'm the leader of the old bottle.
I like a single.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bicycle?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play a very good golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here now.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come on!
Stop moving.
Were Tom there?
I've shed blood this afternoon.
My back's still in pain.
Where's Tom gone?
They look like American.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father could drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need your friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his position was Jackson.
You know Tom longer than I am.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My mail hasn't reached yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom keeps his word very low.
It's something to eat.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where am I going to get the Stamp?
I'm going to scream.
Can he speak French?
Tom could have taken it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
No more baby?
And one day it's gone.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to demand my mail?
We do what we want.
Tom's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for students whose mother language is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who would you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
No one's worth it.
Are you here?
The rest are laughing.
How long will you stay?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I've lost my stuff.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want Tom to wake up.
My son's getting business.
The sky looks like snow can start tonight.
How much is it worth?
You know exactly what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in the woods should not be stones.
Why are you screaming?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his skin back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city has been divided by a river east and west.
Come on, look at yourself.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tom's playing the gortter.
Do you have any idea what to do now?
He's running away now.
Can you keep watch over Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth is hurting.
How does it do these elements?
How much more must more be given?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Take your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's take a look at it.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
She was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't take my right foot.
I've got a kiss.
How old are you?
Can I ask a question?
What's that?
Take your key.
We've seen something worse.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's hungry.
Chrogosh likes Guazza.
You didn't understand.
My mom is hurting.
Sit at the table.
She's younger than me.
What is your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book is only available in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay with the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson.
He's got a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone's screaming.
Do you have any leave for the students?
I'll eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask how they do, ask what they do.
Will you come in?
I'm telling you.
We like football game.
What are you gonna eat?
Good evening.
He'll eat empty fruit.
I want new tastes for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll go through the wind till the rain comes tomorrow.
My right shoulder's hurting.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't hold the train at 7:00.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a pen?
The class doesn't start before eight.
How long do you eat that?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
What they did is wrong.
My son is too long from me.
Tom's parents were also singers.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
Looks like he's in the face.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat whatever you want.
Let's go.
I'm just burning.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Put it in.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're sniffing.
You're screaming.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like the painting.
He's grown in France.
He didn't work on Sunday.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
There are three people who have been killed.
He doesn't eat anything except the fruit.
Tom's father is a sorucker.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's a time.
I'll never forget.
Where's the door on the UA11?
I'm a dog.
Why are you screaming?
Tom wants his skin back.
How often do you go to sleep?
The country has made a deal between themselves.
I talk to Tom in empty French.
Tom got eyes on.
Can you give it a bit of guffet?
Tom's now, sir.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's walking.
He's not yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
Fearers left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I've lost my brain.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has done the same thing.
Get out of the city!
Go to Tirish.
He's eating.
How old was that church?
Let's go!
This is Japanese.
Did you see him grow up?
How much do you leave for the Shital bus for airport?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got it.
We walked on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom was screaming.
Tom's just laughing.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctor.
The plane's got the right time.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom won a lot of race.
He knows where we live.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's wiped out.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll stay outside.
My mother can cook well.
They're screaming.
The study was successful.
I think Tom's got that gold is too little to be given to him.
Boston is a big city.
Me too, too.
Here you go.
Let's go of Tom.
Eat your milk.
Both of us are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flowers?
Tom's injured.
Get Tom's footprint.
Is Tom still angry with me?
Tom's gone.
We're waiting for you.
I'm not good.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you screaming?
What's your father's name?
Look at that way.
You'll tell me what I'm doing.
We tried.
Tom left the October.
The market is on the side of the doctor.
Good afternoon!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom turned his head off.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue eye.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Are you going to go buy it with me?
Come on, come on.
They're there.
I'll scream.
Everybody's okay.
Don't hurt me.
Who was it?
I'm Lajuk.
When I said that Mary left the city, she was really surprised to see Tom.
I heard a scream.
How long did your plane take?
Master don't want to talk about this.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I'm getting up at 8 o'clock today.
Please fire the light.
Tom's injured.
I'm still your friend.
It took me more than two hours to translate some pages into English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is this the biggest road to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Where do you know him?
It's impossible!
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
What's wrong now?
The words that do not correct the correct ones can be added to a more common translation.
Your shoes are here.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Just listen, is this train going for Washington Square?
We're in a state of desensitization.
There's AC in this house.
Are you all gone?
Tom just went to Boston.
Make it clear.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
It's probably raining.
I'm not proud of him.
Is there anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's hungry.
It's just blood.
Are you going to catch us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in a half minutes.
One minute.
Tom was injured.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
Don't see!
As soon as possible, do it.
Use it.
How long does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand.
I've been up for seven o'clock this morning.
I'm home.
Run slowly.
Happy birthday!
I went inside.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
It's amazing.
Do it again!
Tom started in the field.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll be close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm hurting my feet.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking what I'll give you on the birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you screaming?
Stay right there.
Eat what you like.
We'd play the party.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've finished my work.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't get inside.
We're lost.
Tom's breathing.
We can still do it.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We're waiting for them.
How old do you think you're seeing me?
Tom's not happy here.
He was angry.
I don't like eating coffee.
Talk more slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
We don't eat it if he doesn't do what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can never play better than that.
We're Lajuk.
The bill can be sold today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
