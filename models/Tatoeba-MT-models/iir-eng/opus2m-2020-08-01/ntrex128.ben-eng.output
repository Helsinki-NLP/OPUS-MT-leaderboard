The Mesdoians votes to change the country's name
On Sunday, the Mayodomen of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the Republic of North Macedonia should be "replaced by the North Macedonia", a step that will resolve a few decades of conflict with Greece and the efforts of the European Union to get members of the group.
Greece, where there is a province of Macedonia, represented its north neighbor's name as a claim of his land and the entrance of Noto and the European Union.
The two governments have made a deal on June, based on the New Name, but oppositions believe that the change will affect the country’s ethnic identity of the Republic of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov questioned whether Turon would complete the minimum 50 percent of the need for the public to be valid in the media.
The question was: "You are for the members of the Noto and European Union with recognition of Greece."
supporters of the Prime Minister Jordan Jawov, with the name of the Prime Minister, have explained the value of giving to the European Union and Noto organisation for the most developed countries since the end of Uganda.

The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Jordan Jawov, and his wife, Jorika and his son, voted on the change in the country for the democracy in Dosco Macedonia, which will open the way to Nato and United in Russia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Party, 54-year-old Validi Kadakov was preparing a small stage and was pulled in front of those who would remove the referendum.
"We're on behalf of Nato and European Union, but we're not through the service door, but we want to add our heads to the "Kavadkar".
"We're a poor country, but we're honored.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to the people like China and Russia and be part of the Eurasia set."
Prime Minister Jayov said that Nato member of Macedonia would provide the necessary funds to accomplish more than 20%.
"I believe there will be a huge number because over 80 percent of us are European Union and Notte," said Javi after giving his belt.
He said there would be a "yes" resulting to our future.
In a survey published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia last Monday, 30 to 43 percent of the voters will take part in the vote for the Outcome.
In another survey carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent were planning to vote on Sunday Sunday.
70 percent say they will vote.
To succeed, more than 50 percent must be voted.

My partner, Joan Ryan, who had the same attitude because he was determined to stand up against Jewish and secular authorities.
In my case, I was guilty of arguing with Jeremy Kerkins.
Regarding the importance of a legal policy, on the importance of Europe and national security, and in the same issues, which Zeremy did not agree with former leaders.
Friday's Nandham's meeting was said to be "we want to promote and promote meetings."
In my eight years as a local Laber MP, this was the first time the GC meeting was held on Friday.
Sadly, today, it is not the honor of that meeting and the promise of the "Dallu, soft" politics has long been forgotten, if it's true.
It is widely acknowledged that Labar party does not have a difference and that each opinion is judged for whether it is approved by the party leader.
It started after Jeremy became leader, which I thought with fellow workers that I had a similar political view they would start looking for the U.S. leader and asked me to accept the position that I didn't agree with any situation - whether it was national security or the EU unit bar.
When I speak openly - and even if what I say doesn't happen - there is nothing I'm invited to remove by social networks, the politics of the center is condemned, and I am told I should not be on the bar party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments given to me are also political.
I've never been surprised to see their career and career as a result of any of my colleagues who face discrimination or ethnic violence every day.
In this time of politics, how was the lack of gaslide common?

But I didn't come to politics.
When I joined the school in Lababer 32 years ago, we were responsibly rejected by the government that destroyed our schools in direct terms, I tried to provide the needs of the government - which is the most needed - whatever local Council's government.
I never hide my politics with the last elections.
None of the Nandham East have been confused about my policy position and the issues of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who preached this campaign on Friday, I will only say that when the country is heading towards a blockitt that will destroy families, business organizations and our public populations, I don't understand the loyalty of the leader of the Liberation Party.
But I don't really have any message for the Nandham Monam, it's for my electionrs, whether I'm proud to serve you, and I'm promising that I will not allow any incompetent danger or political issues to stop me for all of you.

The whole country of Bolivia, the most blood source of the century, is still alive at Chile’s memorial of Harrana’s visit to the island of Tatina Pasifake.
These hopes may be the highest in a few decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the release of the International Court on October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Blivia has that speed, unity, and a good look, and of course, we expect results with positive outlook," says Bolivia's blogger Robert Kalzaladola.
Many Bolivian ISIS Rooling will see the largest screenings across the country, hoping that the Tribunal Bolivian Bolivians will come to support the claim that after a few decades, Chilei Bolivian was forced to have a series of discussions about letting her out of the sea.
Ivo Morlas, Bolivia's Casistian president - who will face a controversial battle for the next year - he also depends on the Sunday rule.
"We're close to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
Some critics, however, believe that the court’s decision for Bolivia’s freedom is not possible - and if it is, it would be a small change.
The National Organization of the Netherlands does not allow Chile to land, and it says they will not set the consequences of the possible debate.
The last six months of hearing ISIS's final argument was indicated that the case was not "Geheeled", said an expert on Chile International Law.
And it may be back in the past four years rather than taking the reason for Bolivia.
This is the current Bolivian administration Hezzek," said Jeret.
Morals' anti-war speech has led to any enthusiasm in Chile, saying.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk to a situation, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
Two countries have not been transferred since 1962.
The Hague's representative, former president Edward Rodriguez, refused to accept the decision of the court.
Monday, Bolivia's "a wonderful chance of a new age" and "a unique opportunity to end a shift of 139 years".
Calzadila also denied that Moralos - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is still using Merime as a political find.
"Never leave the right to enter the rest of the Pacific" he adds.
"The opportunity to see that we have to cut off the past"

John Edward: Language skills are needed for the people in the world.
The independent schools of Scotland have kept a record of the Edemiimic priority, and the result of a more limited test in 2018, which has been strengthened by the efforts of sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools are trying to provide their students and parents the best level of high level, represented by the Scottish Council of Indians (SCISS).
Foreign schools are aiming to prepare their place as well as their students for higher education and higher education, their chosen careers and world citizens.
As a highly educational field that can be used to design and use, we are looking for modern language to continue as popular and popular in schools.
Nellson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to her in her own language, she'll go to her heart."
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to make relationships and trust with people of other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
From the results of this year's recent tests, we see that language is at the top of the tunnel table with the highest level in the national school.
A total of 68 percent of students from foreign language students have received high grade.
According to the report from the 74 members of the SCISS School, 72 percent of students have received high geddy on the top of the German study, 69% of the German study studies, and 63 percent of the students have also been paid.
This proves that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary for the future of children and young people.
Now, as the language is popular, the readings of independent schools and somewhere else must be held in the same way (the science, technology, technology, and culture).
U.S. commission for Emplification and Scales in 2014 has seen a total of 17% responsible for their efforts to fight nuclear power.
So more than that, the language skills of young people have become important to prepare for their future careers.
The language that is needed for more possible projects is needed worldwide.
Anyone who chooses Carrie, if they learn the second language, will have their real advantage with their skills in the future.
As possible to communicate directly with foreign people, a wide variety of languages will automatically be done before the contests are fought.
Ugv of more than 4,000 adults in Ukraine in 2013, according to the discussion, 75 percent could not speak well in any foreign language and the only ten - percent of the French language was 15 percent.
That's why it's important for children to make contributions for language education today.
More than one language, especially in developing economics, gives children a better opportunity to search for meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will be divided into their educational languages.
Several schools will be interested in modern modern languages, while considering 2020, others will learn the language that is most important for U.S., such as Madrasin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be many languages to choose at international schools, including experts.
Scottish Communist schools are required to provide the environment of education that will prepare children and make them more efficiently to succeed in the future whatever happens.
It cannot be denied at this moment that language plays an important role in the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Actually, modern languages should really be considered as "uninternational skills" in reality.
Different schools will provide this choice, contrast, and appeal for youths in Scotland.
You must be an attendee.

North Korea says "No way" will not be protected without belief.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United States on Saturday that the ban on the United States has increased to doubt the U.S., and there is no chance of leaving their nuclear weapons in the national situation.
In the annual General Assembly of the United States, Rei Yang said that North Korea has taken the necessary action to stop nuclear and nuclear experiments last year, to break the nuclear test, and to not increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons"
"We didn't see any response in the United States."
"If there's no confidence in our national security in the United States, we'll never trust in our national security, and there's no way to protect ourselves from the threat."
Although Riding's "inhumanity" method on Washington, North Korea's complaints against the idea that it would be rewarded because of slow action in North Korea, his speech was justified because he did not completely leave human abuse as a result of the fact that he did not do so.
On June 12, the first assembly of the US president and leader of the North Koreans mentioned a series of participants who were forced to work on "the international bans of the Indian subcontinents in Korea" when the train announced that it was given to the North Korea's security center.

Washington also has also been attacked by the calls of severe international bans on North Korea.
"Merica has insisted on "responsibly" and has increased pressure by banning their objectives, even against the declaration of "the end of the war," says R. R. R.

Yet, the statement of Ryre’s speech has been quite different since last year, when he told the UN to mark the original land in North Korea's Routines as "M: Ilever President" campaign suicide.
This year, this year, Tram, warned by the United Nations that the last year of North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage to take action, but he said that there must still be a lot of work and bans until the North Korea has been banned.
Wednesday Trop said there's no time for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia reasoned that Pingang should be rewarded for taking steps to the U.S. Security Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State of Mexico has also told Americans on Thursday, security Council: "The bans of the Council must continue to be effective unless we do not fully appreciate the notice."
Security Council has increased bans from 2006 to 2006 to shut down the money in North Korea in order to stop the nuclear and banking activities of Pinginging.

Harved's students are doing a lot of rest.
This year, a new core caffine-sailing "sanzaga" in Harved's university has made it possible for all his students to get sleeper to get sleep more sleep.
One teacher discovered that students of a number of university students in the world are often confused about basic issues about how they care about themselves.
Harved Medical School's Medical School has created this course for professor and Brigiham and woman hospitals, who believe that it is the first time in the United States.
After giving a speech about what had been affected by the lack of sleep teaching, he got the motivation to start the course.
‘ Why did a girl say this to me so long? ’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping - what made me surprised, 'She told the telegraph.
This first year, the course of this year is to help students to sleep the good habit of sleeping in the Ethics and the Atlantic Performan and then explains how to improve their general health.
According to Paul Barra, the school director of the University of Harvard Medical School and the university’s health staff, Paul Barra said that the students decided to start the course after they had been sleepless asleep for the next week.
In a long course, there are some relatively related cases.
In one section, a student's cell, where students will learn about the effects of coffee, paper, teacher, and books by clicking on coffee, trains and books and will know how the light and light is affected by the blacksmiths sleep and will appreciate the importance of a bedtime rule.
In other categories, participants are told how long sleep can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of Campus with interactive icons, then the participants are moved to think about their daily bread.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.'
However, we believe that they have the right to know - even if your cigarette is decided to eat, it has the right to know the effects of health, adding 'Feer'.
He says that the culture of "supervatory" is still present, he adds, that there is an increasing problem for modern technology and students to sleep because of increased pressure on modern technology and students.
You should have a student's “Glossion weapon” in order to fight against depression, hunger, and anxiety, he says - even making sleepy brains, make them hungry.
In California, a 19-year-old Redd Soo, professor Soyer, helped design the first year of his first year in Harved.
He said that this course opened his eyes and woke him up for a Camp-Wyed Corres.
In the next step, he hopes that all the satellite students will ask to complete a sted program before they join the competition.
Professor Siegla recommended when students should go to bed and when they need to wake up and consider the impact of a alarming event and the impact of the damage done by the Biedjian screen and Eldo Allo, which may have caused your circuitian censor to fall asleep.

Maxin Wattts exposes information on the GOP satellites, 'Servatory' and deny 'tribution'.
The U.S.S. Republican Maxin Waters denied that a member of his activists posted personal information on the Wikipedia page of the US.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that the issues were published by Alright Wang and websites.
"Matha, lies and more bitter lies," said Twitter on Twitter.
The information shows that the home address and phone number of U.S. Sints in the United States contains the United States's home number and phone number, Gram, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both.
On Thursday, information was published online, an unknown person posted on the internet when he heard about the charges against the Supreme Court's elector of Supreme Court's voters.
It's only a few moments after asking for this three-in-a-Century captain Kavanna.
The IPP address to the "Waters" office, reported that such sites as Gatwe are supported by the Gateway and Redstett reports that the source of the post was connected to the office of the "Waters" office and published information from one member of the hotel workers.
"The unsatisfied accusations are full of lies and a genuine lie, "Heaters continue."
"My colleagues - whose identity, personal information and security have been covered by this plan and false accusations - no one has been responsible for the arrest.
This un-based complaint is completely wrong and a false lie."
Many have been criticized on online online with the statement of the former White House, the former press of the White House.
"It's unequivocally angry," wrote Fischer.
"It says it doesn't make him a member of the Congress."
They don't get angry when they're accused of anything they didn't do.
They're definitely not a traitor.
They must not question the purpose of the complaint.
They must be quiet and clean."
The judge's reaction to the reactions of the Walker was compared to the reactions of Witterser, Philer, and the critics who thought he was very angry when he was not listening.
The Republican candidate Omar Navaro, who is chosen to remove the Waters in the middle of the election, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"If it is, it's big," he tweeted.

"We'll make sure the criminals will be released," he continued, "and they will be legally charged for any member and members of my employees and the most dangerous work."
John English Resistrics Agriculture analysis - weak Ron Atkinson's spy
It is now traditional to see in a new image with British triangles, and it seems to have been applied to the public English-Camde Spof of France - which began in 2003 and returned to John English in 2011.
Clearly, how many trashies would we be able to make the new Roffa?
In any rate, there is a license to create new things like a second time-long public English - which suggests that he was designed for the Sina world without English.
He must have shared a note of the Olympics of the Ferrem’s theme, even despite a couple of links, a Dish and a D-PP in London in 2012.
He was primarily based on the Traver and the international person Atkinson once called at the barcaked TV advertisement.
This last ji outing has one or two accidents.
I'd like to see John English coming to a helicopter after the middle of the Middle Ages.
The gift of Atkinson's gift for physical jokes, but the jokes seem to be extremely low and unusual, especially, like "serving" and "Serias" like the mission Emposss.
The joke seems to be that it's meant to children more than adults, and I don’t have the unique and unequivocal consequences of John English.
Traditionally, the top British has been in serious trouble.
A Cyber hacker's secret website has been attracted to a very private website in Britain, to identify the agents of all Britain’s agents, a sad role for Kevin Edd.
It's the last trust of a prime minister who has already suffered a full-on-dependence of politics, he is confused and unintended: Embassy-massioned by this half-me character, but there's nothing too much to do in the script.
His criminal counselors told him that each active spy was being attacked, so he had to get someone out of the way.
And that's what it means to raise John English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in some Western countries, but the record tells out about how he's going to be a teacher: there's some good jokes here, since English has been fired in Gondri's Rock-Tati-Tip.
The English white woman Ben Miller came back to his previous long-long bikeic bus for necessary use and returned to the White House.
Bau is now a married man, married to a sub-turban commander, with a jelly-het-Sticky-Sticky role in which VikiPadin has been removed some.
So Batman and Ribin returned to the operation to the operation of Ophilia, the wife of Ophilia Ophilia.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is getting dangerously involved in the occult that he claims he can solve the problems of Britain's computer: Jack Lasie Lassint, the head of the police.
English and Bau started their sociologists' strange words of high-gnin: They set fire in a flash of French restaurants; they hit them on a voltage boat; and they started killing themselves; and they tried to get out of the English mobile home to identify themselves.
All the posts must have been closed for the last stage, but the amount of time it's a lot of children's thinking on the issue.
It's a lot between me and you.
And I couldn't imagine like other public English movies: British film film Roy Atkinson can't give any role that is true about his image?
Laber denies that it's planning for Britain to work four days a week, but it's worth five days.
Jeremy Kagann's family will consider a key plan that will be considered for four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
The group reports that the members of the organization would spend extra time saving workers on another day by the revolution.
It's going to be seen to enjoy the three days of the workers, but it'll still take up the same pay.
The sources indicate that the idea of the "fift" of the group's economic activities will be "fet" and that workers are planning to move the country.
The Tredes Union Congress is allowed to move into a four-day week as a way for workers to receive the change of economy.
One of the leading members of the Laber Party told Time Times: 'A policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen, but it will not happen four days, but it's a desire for the company to protect the company's company for economic security.'
The first time to support this national idea, the Green Party promised four days during their general election campaign in 2017.
The desire is not currently supported by the Labar party, even if it is not supported by the party.
A member of the Laber Party said: “One day the four-day work party is not policy and this group is not being considered by the authorities.”
Shedo Chansal, John MacDonal, used the last week's labor conference to present his views for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonal said that he was determined to return power from the organization's "unsupervative director" and 'Lavor'.
The current share of the water management's plan is not to return to their entire share because the labor government can give some 'ss' for misappropriate action.
He also ensures the planning to keep the organization's work on board and to build the owner's property for 10% of the workers' rights.
Granada in London, tell John Kendy "60 minutes" that if Kavana's analysis can change their mind.

"I told you to go to listen, I said, I spoke with the judge Kavanna.
After this incident, I called him out of the complaints, saying, 'Have you done this?'
He was a strong, uncompromising person."
Grahm votes, of course, seem to be unequivocal.
"My Brett Kavana's mind has been created, and a big big complaint must be changed," he said.
"D. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this is: Brett has refused to say "Christine Blassi Blossy Ford."
"But the name he said they couldn't verify.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."

He's one of O'Fam's past and past, and he's given a lot of money this week.

Europe’s Captain Thomas Bojner knows that large body too can be invisible
Thomas Bojner, the European Captain, knows from experience that even if the largest body with a large body is named in Singapore during the last day of the period, it could be impossible.
Dan's self-destruct in 1997, where he received five points to the U.S. leader of the S.B.
"You should remember that we had our large body in the good night; our big body in Brooklyn, where we lost, and where we win, but the name's only short, says Borgan, he's seen in photos, Friday and last day at the age of 5-38.
History will show me and the team that it's not done yet.
Full of encouragement.
Get on the ground and do the right thing.
It's not until it's not over until the board.
We have one goal, that's trying to try and see our bird's eyes.
I've always told you that I'm looking at 12 of my team's players, but we're also very careful about who we're on the other side of the world.
Borgan adds that I am happy with what our players have done at the Hard Glof Corre, "I will never believe in Abper.
Tomorrow's a different fight.
Tomorrow's private frescoes, and it's a different thing.
When everything's good, it's great to be with the Potter, but when you are alone in the field, your powers are fully tested as a golf.
This message should have been passed on to all players, which should be the best one to send.
Now, you have to leave your partner and take the best back."
On the opposite side of Bojran, the fan will be watching for the players who play as a group, who play best as best as possible, Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who brought up three points on four points.
For the last day in Europe, Führer’s experience as part of the Great War party and the rest of Brooklyn, as part of the final day of the drama.

When the game falls, it's too heavy in the middle of the match.

Paul Casi, Justin Roz, John Ram, Tom Filwood and Yan Polulter are responsible to take the lead against the Europeans, who will be facing him at the beginning.
"I've organized this team on this team because I think it'll cover everything," Borgan says about his election.
The new war in Germany has been suspended again.
The local news news reported that the former cold-war war-jug had to be started in 2014, but at least because of the injustice system and sniffing costs, it would not have been until the next year.
Commenting on the military spokesperson, the New Budden-Worteberg-Sharvet, the first ship of this Frieden-Servatory, was suspended by the "Rranland-Faza" first to begin 2009.
The ship was to be connected to the boat in 2014, but the high-level project was having a problem with the health issue.
In 2007, the crew who led four thousand-vertmberg-shire ships will take the place of the old Bremen-Clas-Cloucate.
It's known that there's a number of stilts, anti-Airforts, and anti-supept, such as Redds, Infredeed, and Akust.
Other important factors include long monitoring of time - the new free flows for two years from far away from the country.
In any case, it's meant to have modern wars - which will help to show power in the country in Germany - it'll be old-fashioned when we are called on, on the Dyette.
Last year, the unfortunate F 125 Freeget came to the title when the German army refused to launch the ship by refusing to launch it.
This is the first time a ship was sent back to Shepbleld's office after the army had sent a ship back to the Shipbler.
The reasons behind the following are quite small, but the German media referred to several important “software and hardware error” that would hinder the ship.
The software's stories are especially important, since Banden-Worremberg's ships will be carried by nearly 120 Nabes - half of the people of the former Bremen class.
Moreover, it was seen that the ship would reduce its activity and cause obstacles to the future progress of the army.
This 7000 tons of "Randland-Fage" seems to be double than Germans used during World War II.
The cost of the entire project, along with the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
The first level of 2.2 billion billion pounds have reached with surprise at 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion).
The recent issues of German ships have become even more significant.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Perels of the German parliament admitted that "Muttan's suitable ship of ship in the air" was debating."
The officer said that the problem had been dealt with for a while, since there was no permanent ship with the old ships that had been canceled.
He laments that there was no ship-sharz in Badden-Worremburg-Sharj was able to join the army.

Rolando has been accused of rape and lawyers are going to bring charges against Germany’s magazine.
He called the charges of rape as "myth news" and said that people want to raise their own opinions on his name.
Her lawyers are ready to accuse German News magazine De Spegel, who has brought this complaint openly.
In 2009, a American woman was accused of rape at a hotel in Las Vegas's home in Las Vegas, U.S.A.
He was accused of giving $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, and on Friday, he was sentenced to the Daily Spiegel report.

"No, no, no, no.
What they're saying is false, says Balan-Do-O.
"They want to raise their own identity by using my name.
It's common.
My name says they want to be famous, but it's a lifeline.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well." The player added to smile.
According to Reuters, Rondo’s lawyers are preparing to accuse the charges against Dr. Spiegel, which they call "an incompetent report for "developed" in the media.
The lawyer Christian Shirtage says that the player may have a serious violation of personal rights in recent times.
The story of Las Vegas has been described in a suit of Pums hotel and Kasino on June 2009.

The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that they were married, but it was agreed.
Mauriga also claimed that she went to the police and was taken to hospital, but later she agreed to the court’s verdict because she was “in fear of punishment” and was afraid to be“inculcate”.
The 34-year-old young man says he's now trying to revisit the solution because he's in a mental state of mind.
During the crime, Rondo Manchester's joins Riil Madrey from the United States, and joined the famous club of Italy’s most famous club deal in the summer.
Brattt: The lost YU will be 'cause of lost location'
Business Minister Greg Clark says that after the brake of the car, the U.S. will lose his position in the world for the first time.
He adds that this is "distributed" that the United Nations has said to Betty BBC that if they leave the British IU without a deal, they will temporarily stop their production at Derby's factory in Berlin.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that if Bricket is in a contract, people could go to work because of the delay.
Barton's factory - made of Toyota Arris and Evans - produced some 1,000,000 cars that have been published in the rest of the European Union last year.
Martin Cook, director of the Towering Center in Boston, says, "I think if Britain is released at the end of March, our career could be closed."
The other car manufacturers of Hunda, B Dubleu, and Zaguor Land Rover, have been concerned about how other cars will be managed without a deal without a deal.
For example, BM DW said they'd shut down their Mini Plant in Oxford within a month after the brakes.
The main concern of the car manufacturers is the risk of the siliment of the bacterium.
Toner's production line is based on "Jest-in-Tim", U.S. for the driving car, and the U.S. is from 37 minutes to 37 minutes each.
If the United Nations releases it without any agreement on March 29, it can be broken down to the border, resulting in a wave of tensions, like a financial crisis.
The organization said that the Touter Duberer Plan is not able to keep more than one day's values in order to stop production.
Mr. Clark says that the tester of Thressa Mesa Meser planned to get involved in the future, "Seman's test plan to avoid such a test."
"We need a deal. We want to do the best deal not only to succeed but also to enjoy the future's potential for improvement, "He says today's today's BBC Radio."
"It's not the cute, but the other producer has also proved that it's important to continue with the success of the bicycle chain."
However, they were afraid to stop the production of Toyota, but they were afraid that the extra income would reduce the chances of the factory's success, and that could result in many jobs.

But let's see, and I always want to tell the news."
Some journalists will oppose this statement, and after September 10, the White House did no more press writing.
Chris Walls asked for his reason.
Sanders said not for “showing” to journalists because they don’t have the brakeing” but, although he said, "I don’t deny that they've been showing people."
Then he suggested to raise direct communication between the train and the press.
"The former president has conducted more questions than any former president," without any evidence, he said: "We have judged that number."
In the future, Sanders said, "It's better to talk to me if the news media has the chance to ask directly to the president of the United States."
We've been trying to do it, and you've seen us doing this for the past few weeks and have been taking the place to speak directly to the president of the United States.
The train took regular questions during the time of the exit of the White House or other guests at the press conference.
Single journalist's meeting is too low.
In New York this week, the president may have seen why other initiatives could be made and sometimes could be seen in front of the journalist team.

Jack Rose: 'My last dream is to take charge of Scotland'
Sandland's boss Jack Rose says he's "the last wish" is to be manager of Scotland any day.
This is 42-year-old Scottland, who is currently enjoying the challenge of returning to the north-east class, who are now in the third place in Ligwan, after three points from the first group.
Last May, St. Martin returned to the Scottish Premiers in the summer.

"I really believed that the machine was more suitable for me than to play.
It's strange to hear that because I've made it right, lived a simple life and enjoyed some success.
But the game is hard.
Each week you need to go through a lot of things.
I still feel the same way about the pressure of work, but the management seems to be right.
