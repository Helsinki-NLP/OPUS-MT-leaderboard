Black box in your car?
While the road pilots in the United States are struggling with the lack of money to improve the Hawa system, many people are looking at it in a small black box that is getting hit from your car's desk.
The device, which tracks every cell that was carried by monitors and communicates the information to authorities, has become an international effort to destroy the system of major streets in the United States today's main streets.
Generally, the Hawaiian initiative has also become an issue of deep disputes and living relationships.
The content of the drive you have drived, and the location of the drive is probably about to be used - to create a taxi bill - to allow support for these Black Boxes to be used in support of these Black Boxes.
Chey party is a mess.
The American Civil Freedom Organization also has a lot of concern about various forms of privacy.
While Congress did not agree that there is no further action, many remain waiting for the Kingdom.
They're looking for how they can go to the system in the next decade to pay for every mile set on the street.
Thousands of monitors have already taken the Black Box for test drive, from which some of them have GPS monitoring.
It's actually an important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we're chosen or not," says Hassan Iya, who is a responsible director of the South California government organization, who is planning to start track every match set by Motro-kerns in California by 2025.
It's going to change the way we pay back.
That's technology to do.
The main reason for this is that the High Trustland of the country has become almost Delhi, which is due to the cost of the debt paid by American citizens on gas puppys.
The Americans don't buy as many gas as before.
Now the car runs more than before in a Galen gas.
There has never been any increase in the past 20 years, which is an 18.4 cent per channel.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians also avoid increasing a money in the tanks.
Transportation policy expert Le Chieni at Mansota University says, "It's not fair."
Their kingdom has recently set up tracking devices in 500 cars to test the perimeter system.
They say, "It will work as the most logical option in the past."
Vonx calls it Melij-based user Schol.
It's not surprising that the idea of citizen generosity is getting better because, for example, it can change things to change things as the car is driving, which can help to reduce the rest of the day and reduce the gas.
California's thinkers are eager for this system while they are developing methods to achieve the specific goals of the state's nobles, Glossy Wermaning Laws.
However, president of the home transport committee, Rep. Bill Schsester (A-P) also considers the most practical option of black box.
There are also free vendors in the Ryan Foundation, too on the side of a mile per mile of payment.
“It’s not just that you're going into the blind, ” says Adrian Maurey, professor of Polish at Renan.
People are paying more clearly for what they're getting.
The campaign has also supported the campaign by two former U.S. presidents who have been granted permission to move from Congress in their report in 2011.
The U.S. Cent has accepted the study of 90-million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural methods, those who were presenting people who had to travel too much to go to work or to go to the city daily, the leaders of the era concluded the proposal.
Still, many of the state and city are heading towards this direction.
It's the most popular Orgoan, who has listed 5,000 drivers in the world's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay for the state instead of gas.
Nevada has already completed the initial tests.
New York City is also moving towards this direction.
Ilinois is testing with trucks on limited basis.
And I-95 groups, including the 17 state transport departments (Merland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying how they can process this change.
This idea was not found in all places.
In Nevada, where was a few hours before the 50 volunteer car drivers were installed, the drivers were so reluctant to think that the government could monitor every step of their steps.
In the Nevada Transportation Department, Aladin Khan said that "bug Bourker and other things were a major problem."
It's not something people wanted.
In addition to furthering the test, the NCLU warned on its website: "! Changing the device to the complete tracking device will be very easy."
There is no need to develop, unaided technology that needs to be spread to each person's daily schedule.
Nevada is one of many kingdoms who are trying to get the best technology, with help to get the state's description of how long the car is running, but not where he's going and when it's going.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more easily.
The search for this technology has led some state agencys to visit the small California State State State.
It wasn't originally in business to help the drivers.
It was attempting to enter the market on the side of AutoBam, which the drivers had to pay on their tax.
But the device that's examining this is good, because it doesn't use the GPS and provides a lot of limited information that is currently loaded by modem at the time.
“If you don’t track people's way and their location, they'll be more willing to do this way.”
There are some big mistakes in these early Kingdom programs.
There are too few expenses to do this.
In Organ, pilots are using different options.
They can be selected with neither HTTPS support nor GPS devices.
Or you can choose no device again, but you can choose to give the exact sum of the average amount set by the Kingdom inhabitants.
Other places have hope that it can be sold by providing more and more supplies for the device than by adding more resources.
In New York City, the transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device, which will also have the opportunity to pay the parking Merrator tax, provide the "Assuming" be provided by your drive, and build up the speed of time data from other drivers that can be used to avoid motor traffic traffic.
The city is referred to as "Morter-Cail will be drawn for participation because of its benefits."
However, some transport plans are surprised that the discussion on pay is a big misunderstanding.
Meterropolintine transport to the San Francisco Bay area said that it can easily deal with the problem of the Kangres Gasex by growing in gas tanks.
There can be an extra-time or annual pay on HIV or other cars, which don't use too much gas to pay their proper share.
Randini Retsler, director of Aug's statement and public affairs, said, "What do you need to do when Esperin is able to work?"
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Fronter Airlines Carrie - On Backgamous
The plan of $100 working for passengers on your flight board in Fronter Airleyes is to keep up $100 for passengers on the board.
The plan to start $100 for a car for a car-on bag in Fronter Airley, and it'll pay $2 for coffee or eggs, although on Wednesday it announced that the passengers can keep the entire disk.
New Carrie - On the back of the backyard, so little bag under the seat will still be clean.
Fortier said that $25 would be paid if paid in Edison, $100 will wait if they wait till they're at the gate.
Fronter Professor Kate O'Malley said that $100 French passengers have to take care of the job.
"We don't want him to pay," he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second test bag in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to escape from the pest as they can do in Carri-on-Baza, which is in over-one Dubai, is usually a little less place in this decoy.
There's one way to bring less for the passengers on the street.
O'Malley said it's not really about buying new wages.
It's hard to find the top most loyal clients to find overhead bin.
The passengers who buy tickets on their website of Airlines don't have to give it.
This means that the next person in line could pay 100 dollars for the same bag, while a traveler in line can get a bag free.
O'Malley said that the professor's website and check-ups are being changed before they get the guts to make sure they know about the case before they get it.
The new Fronter's new Carrie - On Face, not to the summer, although a date has not been specified.
Travelers often express a misunderstanding on the back of the bazaar and other pet, but the plane service prefers them.
They argue that money spends money to manage the bag, and those who want travel service should pay for it.
Many are looking for a sign on the Wall Street as a sign that many Airlines are paying enough money to cover air travel after many years of airports.
Most of them don't have Carrie - on bag shells.
Spartit Airlines Inc. Carrie-on-one started the first three years ago, and partner Alexander Algebrant Air later.
There is also the Wizz Airer's Wiz in Airlines, which is Airlines counselor, said by Sorenson, and that Ad - On.
He brings the sparre-on-on-50 million in a year which was calculated in the December 2011 report.
One of the former officers of Sorenson, Midvest Airleyes, recently flying in Spart and the passengers had to face Carrie - an unusual bag face on the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my Airlines Carrier," he said.
I was hoping to be seen out on a battle gate.
"It's full and they said it's put down."
Fronter's also following $2 of the $2 for coffee, tea, eggs, or shoes.
It's good to know that those who leave, or the ones who take shoes, can keep the whole bill, and will give it free coffee only for once.
It's still gonna clear the water.
In 2008, U.S. Air Force tried to hire drugs in 2008, but after seven months of complaint, they turned back and followed other other major Airlines.
Fortier's passengers don't buy them directly if they don't buy the Airlines, this is my job to manage the goons on their own website.
Airlines repay online traffic vendors for $10 to each of these tickets.
That's why, instead of going through an online traffic agency, the passengers are encouraged to buy them directly from them.
Fortier, this field has gone forward.
Many of the flights in September were often spent half a mile away for customers who bought an online train agency from these people.
On Wednesday, it dropped to 25 percent of the traffic congestion.
So, a 1,000 miles [100 km] from an online traffic agency will release a thousand miles [200 km] of $50 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in front of the Fronttier website directly.
There's a loyalty to customers in their home city in Frontinator's Danger's city, but it's losing business and it's losing money.
The collapse of 9 percent of the state's collapse and its air capacity has reduced to about 13 percent in the first three thirds, according to the Corpoporte Pripitator Republished Aires Highway Ink.

Sketches in Bombardier's death as a degree of flight, crashing in orders.
The airship of Canada and trainer Bombardor Inc announced the fall of 15 percent on Thursday, the third third on the train unit, and the lower-offs at the limits.
The Centrally based Bombarder also did not present any flight data for his new CSSSys Airport on release or flight from the plane to the commercial service of the next September.

Camaron Douran, with National Bank Finsil, a researcher reduced his rating for the "Drama" on Sundays to "the field display" is limited over one or two thirds.
"The Maggeer plane had been expecting too much, we're absolutely disappointed with the mission display, "Dourran said in a client note."
We'll have a new command for the Bombarder CSereses as the progress of the flight program.
However, if no new commands are announcing in months coming, there's no doubt that the market program will be reassembled.
Bombardder expects the plane family now to cut it at least at the end of Boing and Airbes market.
The first test took place in the plane and was the first time in September after the delay.
Possible careers are waiting for the result of the test of the company's efforts to recognize the benefits of flights on the cards and possible costs, but as long as the order for CSSSSSSSRs is fixed between 177.

Each designer makes a sedal in a different way.
We've decided to take a first flight and take an update and say what we have done.
That's why that's gonna be all through that flight program.
The rest of the five tests of flights soon after the following weeks, the company said.
Yet, the suspects are doubting that after their first flight in 12 months, a CSYS plane plane could begin.

New research shows that we work with whole honesty and dedication in the morning.
A false report and a false witness can't be found in the heart.
But at evening we change our mind, and we start walking contrary to the rules.
In this series of research at David Eclas of Business at Harvard University and YouTube, researchers have given a number of interesting facts.

The researchers used two to use it.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people were to tell the point that the point is up to the left or to the right.
The participants were told that if they answered the wrong answer rather than the right answer, they would be paid.
In this review, it was noted that people who were used in between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and answered the right answer.
There was found time to use people from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the evening to correct their principles and to give them the wrong answer.
This has led to the success of the surveys to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make our honesty difference, but at the evening we stop stressing morality.

Mr. Big is an account of the police's secret information on the police check.
42 - year - old Bishett told the criminal sharboroughs
Several thought that his secret nebulous drug habit could be learned
He had spent three years in prison with the Liberal Coron court
To the top of the rescue party, who told Mr Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his reputation, people would know about his secret case, three years old.
After 42-year-old Basharish Ditta agreed to compromise her contract, she provided sensitive information about her drug experiments.
The case was named "Bash", and its criminal was praised as "tup-Birf" was arrested in Scarbo after the police administration in 2011, which he represented in the previous Nacotex Trill.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarboru in Blackburn, Llacker's house in the lawyer's house, while he went out with his colleagues to the L.O.S.A.
After finding a cup of coffee in his credit card, and his credit card, he found that it was the "animist user" of Dita A category.
During the eight months between January 2011 and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his associates.
At that time, the police were taking care of all the suspects as part of the main investigation of Lycashire, Colombia, Massseid, Barcchiir and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people who were sent to prison during several copies by police, who were sent to the heron and cokeen, and more than 20,000 pounds after being sentenced.
42-year-old Dette reported warning to criminals because he was afraid he should not tell people about his coat.
The situation in Blackburn was under ban for the law for the Forbes Societys, three weeks after the death of the Liberal Crown court, the case was faced by the Liberal Court.
He accepted a contract in the previous ears.
The lawyer started at the time of the crisis when the police found that he was regularly on the phone from February 2011 to December 2011.
Two spies pursued the suspects and saw him at the door of Dmitta and placed over 60 percent of pure medicine under the bill of the lawyer’s bill in the Black Glove.
After the Nazi drug was placed, Scarboru dette was regularly on the phone, who went out to the Buckern Rovers football stadium in Ecuador, Ivand Park.
When the lawyer came home, he found that there was a coconut there, and there was nine times a conversation between them.
The trial was heard in court that it was found to be a “remarked user” of Cocaon’s "anical user user" when she was found on Detatta's hair, bottled and credit cards.
Detta was later arrested, but she refused to use Kokkan and said that she was talking to the suspect dealer because she was her client and said that their discussion was about "a unique privilege."
During his arrest, Dmitta took her wallet and tried to remove a lot of credit cards, but they were put to work, and her hair was drawn.
In an interview with the police, he said he was also operating from his office with his work-in-law, and his client called on his home for legal matters.
After telling what the spies knew about them by arresting the authorities, the court was told that the Dettta Natali drug had called the principal of the Shire, which he had presented before some of the people.
From the mission party, Anne White said: "You should know the best thing about not breaking law."
It's accomplice to abuse your position as an official officer on Mr. Dmitta, and to join your particular client.
We're not talking about general drug dealers, but about a dealer who is giving his lawyer a nasty medicine.
Some of their conversations must have made sure that they had no doubts, because he was a lawyer.
But the lawyer went beyond his limit of relationship.
As much as possible, he insisted on the police investigation so that they would be able to continue their most dangerous activities.
Mr. Dmitta was insulting, not the honor of her profession.
She made a lot of gifts from some specific client, especially from Scarborough, and allowed her freedom to compromise.
Ditta denied any wrong action and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who is not me, and if I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but I did it immediately.
But after hearing, Mr. Helstad, president of the police, said: “The time when Mr. Ditztad started to receive drugs from organized criminals, he changed himself into a criminal.
The reason for their Kokkin took too much agreement and became too weak for the objectives of the members of the organized crime groups, who used her to receive important information related to police investigation.
Those who have problems must maintain the greatest standard of honesty, and trust in people.
Mr. Ditta has been deceived by this belief and tried to save her career.
Sri Lanka's serious and organized crime unit tested Mr. Dita, where they were found guilty of three cases to keep the way of justice and now show our respect for our actions to bring criminals to court.
The case should be a warning to criminals that no one is far away from the law.
We'll find you and present the court case.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison for his arrest of heroin, Kokkin and Hong Kong.
Twenty-five other members of the group were sent for the entire 153 year for drug crimes.
At his website, Dmitta gave questions and answers on her questions and answers, which she said would be due to becoming a lawyer for the death penalty in the United States, to be his demean guest and to encourage her to do their work.

According to a survey made by some 10 out of a business organization, some 10 out of the United States have canceled the plan to use the data production program after a US-based media program.
Jim Snub, chief activist with SAP, says: "We saw a new question that didn't come up a year ago-- it's called My Data?" And can you guarantee that it will remain in that power field physically?"
Several German authorities argue that the latest reports were already confirmed: that powerful government wants to steal their most precious secrets and data and that it should be put on each scale.

The parents of a teenage youth in Georgia who died in the "Nosecution" believe that their son was killed
A youth in Georgia whose dead body was found in her High School Mett, believes that the murder of his son was committed by the family's head.

The U.S. Prime Minister Michael Perry told Guru that he's an official test on the death of Jones, seeing that many important questions are answered.
What was the cause of death?
Did his murder cause any crime?
My husband told Guru these words at a journalist’s session in the afternoon.
I will follow vanity, and bring them unto us whithersoever I may be.
My purpose is to bring the truth.
He said, "I think it's an international test."
Morer said to the reporter that the death of Johnson was due to the death of the "responding" of the dead.
According to Murray, a different reason for death was found in a second test.
They said, “We will be able to give a good answer, or to be of those who deserve to be questioned.”
Moreur also said that if he found enough witnesses to try a criminal's death or to check out the rights of civil authorities, he would ask him to do it.
The delegates were not immediately available to comment from the office of Londez Cantie Cherrif's office when it was called to the Guru.

On Wednesday, the U.S. government issued a direction to control the disease and to control the food of children in the school.
For the first time, this direction has been issued by the U.S. government, because the number of students who attend school has increased from food problems.
Now one of each of the 20 children in the U.S. is eating.
CDC found that 18 percent of children between 1997 and 2007 have increased their dietal problems.

I'll be able to make the guts made by doctors.

Well, it's probably Wells Simpson's having access to the Internet.
Linger's identity is not still considered well, but most experts in the United States believe that when Linger is not able to specify the best information to use and retrospecting, if the child comes in such a condition, try the mental and physical development of the child.
Medical Dr. Jack Drischer of New York City City, professor of Ling-Pachan's new law, said that the new law of Germany looks good."
Intersex children create moral stimuli.
He said: “Some people are in a state of self-compatibility that requires a lack of self-corruption, but most children don't do it."
You can specify a line without a shell-technology, and then see how identity develops.
It's not the science to know how to develop any gender in a child.
No one can give the right answer to why that happens.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In 2011, a report by the European Commission of Investigation stated that the Intersex people are defined as different from the transposiblesal or transpondor people, since their position is not related to sex, not to the genetic design, but to women, not to both women or both.
These features can also display other sexual stimulations, such as the weight of meat, hair distribution, breast and length; the primary sexual activity, such as the primary sex engine; or the quality structure and hormones.

According to the newspaper on France 24 reports, there are still issues related to sex in the neighboring country of France.
In 2011, French methods from this Catholic country have signed on the Ekats to go back to the "Linging Policy" books of the school.
The site of the U.S. is also opposed to this law in Germany, saying, "When the world is going to be in such a state, there is no choice but not to act, but we are taking both two and columns in opposite direction."
In Maryland, the mother of a newborn child, also told Ben John that he would like to see the baby being born when she was born.
He said on the website, "The rise is very stressful without extra limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
In historically, the children born with both men and women were called Hammfrediths (Bulti) who were the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
About a decade ago, the medical world considered Linger as a slammed, and it could be written again.
But now, many people are challenging the moral level of social-century, they realize that the gender is complex, and sometimes even among doctors who don't know what to think about their ability when children grow up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, ” says Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr.
When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the Shelikh.
The current principle regarding the treatment of children with unsatisfied genetics was presented by John Hepkins University, who considered Lingi to be unequivocal.
He created the term "Ling ID" and argued how social and environmental signs and parents raise children - with children's genes and hormones, determine that he is known as male or female.
But in a matter that is known as "Jon/Jun" in 1966, their principles were disputed.
He advised his parents to take the baby to the full and his red-fashioned daughter, a young girl who had been attacked during the attack at the Linggggrim-Ugrmran-Urman (Sermanson), who had been attacked by a child who advised him to leave the baby full and get his eggs out of the baby and do like her red-Pan girl.
She said, “I did not know where she will be done, but she has done the right thing.”
At the age of 15, the child changed himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.

But in the years following the arrival of the Internet in 1990, the men who started coming to the front of the Lingala-Chetrics began to say, "It’s not fun."
The same case was with the 36-year-old writer James Bruce, who was born with X.V., but his public was unknown.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his body was small, or his brother was bigger, but they were certain that he could never live as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s mother was taken by the Baus and Ancsi-Cheelsi-Cheticals, and he was raised as a child.
She was given to women Hormon when she was 12 years old.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was hard to question.
At 18 years of age, he was supposed to be a veneer.
But feeling confused and confused, he asked for medical records.
This led him to find out the fear of the truth.
When I was born - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with D.D., who stopped his body from creating teststs in enough measure, which caused his genetics not to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man back, he took a gun for teststoron and pulled his teeth off.
He's lost because of Shilli-Chetical.
Today, he is teaching people about Internet people to make their own ideas about the Internet.
However, the modeling group of California-based groups of Advocacys Forum for Infrade, is concerned that Germany's law calls "supervatory and black-sharing".
He says, "Many activists think that Germany's law will move parents to make immediate decisions and to set the child "unborn".
We're afraid it'll encourage the opposition.
We think it's better to specify a man or a woman line rather than wait.
But we don't know how the law will handle our role, so we can just guess.
Tamer-Mats said that their organization supports the Australian law because "it allows the elderly to recognize the third sex."
He said, "The elderly should be able to decide themselves about medical sex."
The German law is related to specifying it at birth.
It's not a fight by newborn children at this time.
As adults, they can take their own decisions related to their body.
But Dr. Erline Barz, head of Pottberg's Red Radio Bazaz, who is the daughter of J.A., who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the law of Germany will provide both parents and children "power."
The daughter of Bartatz was born with the male qualities, but she was a full addition to the complete Andrzej order called D.D.
Because his Anderson was guilty of crime, the woman in Katty grew up.
He's in his body, but he's not pregnant or partial.
Now 29-year-old Katty is married and has a schedule for child learnnology departments in Pennsylvania.
Although she's barren, she hopes to be mother through the gasoline cessi.
He said, "This is the law that allows parents to do what they want to do."
It provides them with a proper understanding and time by some tests before writing, “man” or ‘multiple’.
In this way, you're all right - grow up, love the baby.
You have a dear child and enjoy him.
We don't need to make a quick-corruption that can't be done.
They said, "This brings up children in the womb and releases parents and their parents' concerns. They don't believe that it is true."
Finally, the child will determine which sex is more easy with -- and it's very good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

The most outstanding hit in the secret chat room is Mark Hilton and John Helmman, a 2012-based 2012 campaigner, "Db Dow Down: Change the Game 2012."
Times obtained a copy of the book Agur, and Sunday afternoon explained what could help us to re-election of Obam’am’s decision to establish the top of the president’s top group and to establish the "Poling" polls in 2011.
According to The Times’s National Political Association Jonathan Martin, the book is full information about the effort in the activities of the prime authorities and the power of the Watch Tower Society for the name of the former White House, which affects the change of policy from the former state’s preconceived state of the former state.
Possible switches were a very safe secret within the foundation of Chicago’s foundation building and the Oval Office.

"Dubble Down" claims that Bunden tried to change the building despite his personal decision before finally making a final decision, when he was finally reporting his information on the state of Obama's tickets.
In a lecture with Martin, Dr.
"I said in front of the whole vision, and one of them, it was" said the news.
Remember that the president was in danger at that time, and we were in the memory like this: "What else shall we do?"
While Doll said "Serh" as "response", Martin told the CNN Cooper's choice to re-election the election campaign, and then re-equivocal the cost of finding it.
"We don't spend a lot of ideas and focus on focus groups until they're seriously considering something," Martin said on S360.
It's obvious, Halaki, or Obama knew their team change.
Martin told CNN that they asked them if they knew their boss's possible change?
While Doy said they didn't think that the president knew the possible change, former Chief of Stutf admitted that it was “probably possible” that this was known as Obama.
"DWOOO" is definitely not answered: is political checking on Ombam's desk?
The Cooper asked Martin if he didn't know about the Obama Bodan Duping tickets.
" Probably," said Martin.

Mike Jorge says that when Kate Perry was 18 years old, they didn't beat her
During this week with the Australian radio show show, Pon Star said that they were singing back to the 2004 song "Old Hubble House" for the 2004 year of January.
Perry said that they had been dating with the top rocker, and ‘ They killed me when I was 18. ’
He said, "This is my must - indeed, this is what I have done [i.e. the angels]. And indeed, this my husband is one of those who did good [to me]."
70-year-old Jorge's representative told Guru in a statement that he clearly denied the victory on Kate Pari.
The representative also said: "It's probably the way the other person is talking about them."
This year, Paris was one of the gorillas who came as guests on Roling Stone.

George Carvan: Euro Walston gave the option to Scotts
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time we are warned that free Scotland will be required to join as independent as a free trip area in Europe as a member of the EU.
The passports on Borvik point out stories about the limit of the Central Star on the walls of the Heridian.
The truth is that Styclicide paper describes the potential economic benefits of free access with the rest of Europe, although it is not specifically described in the Hedleyes.
No one described that the EU members allow most of their time to change their official rules according to their needs.
Since Scottland is no longer out of the ground, Brasislava will always be free to receive anything from Scotland.
So, then, A-Khanni.
And what's been caught so long ago has been gathered. First I've heard the "Pportience Control" news about the Bangladeshi news about 40 years ago.
Still, the interesting point was lost to the old story again.
Why should it be expected to sell Europe from independent Scotland?
Why should the brothers of London have been working for Bruces, especially now?
The real European news is: The Great, War-Victation Plan has finally stopped.
With Euro trouble, the project has died under official authority in Europe.
In the whole EU, dedicated groups are getting strong enough to resist or turn down as similar currency.
Even in Germany, U.S. Anti-Turpactiv for German Party - which has already been established this year - suddenly took up nearly five million votes in September' elections, and thus forced free duplicates out of Budapest.
The plan to build the organization Europe has always been opposed.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a real change.
In addition to the harsh rules set by Berlin and Europe, many people have to think that the project has gone too far.
There was not a lot of role in Europe’s disaster - it was true in the matter of Greece.
Rather, the European system established its members with the nuclear rate of German exporters - something that they want to keep up with German politicians.
Without the possibility of a lack of money, South Europe finds itself in a damage to its product's inside of Germany.
The only way is to reduce the situation and public health - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
The Global European productivity is known for its ongoing budget and trade problems.
As a result of the “superiary” power policy provided by French and German power workers, Europe spends four times as much as double and gas as the United Nations.

After the education, the top politicians of France saw the EU control of Germany, and Paris was the way to provide the equivalent of the legacyings in the world.
But Berlin doesn't need Paris as a passport for political recognition now, and this applies to Europe its own economic policy, which causes France's economy to fall.
The result: Marin Le Pine's south of the U.S. National Front has won the third victory over the Soviet Union in recent decades.

We can choose to be the territory of Litil England (inclusion).
Or we can protect our own economic interests — which includes telling Berlin and Brasisisles to be separated at the right time.
I think Scottland can do a better job in the European system, as well as we keep our own signatures.
It would be easier to work together with other countries in Europe than in non-national nations.

This week, in Orlando, Florida, U.S. - U.S. Children’s Medical Association, U.S.A.
"I spend a lot of time giving the audience confidence - that it usually doesn't represent the motion progress in the direction of the whole plane."
The fact of development has been seen before time in the hair and hair of the boar and skin of the thong and the physical smell of the young girls.
But in the past four decades, there has been a very simple change in the time of the first watch.

Clolivets are socialists, but they admit, "Tonching can increase practical points, and girls may feel different from their partners."
The other big problem could be understood: The girls don't want their little girl to be a magazines.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the dangers of the womb or how they will keep it clean."
A woman who had started a magazine religion at 10 years of age recalls, "It was a shock."
Although it was signs of that, and we also talked about the magazine, but it wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was scared of her school and went back to worry that her first magazine religion had started in her colleagues.
There are a lot of well-known principles about the reasons for the intruder.
Nevertheless, there is no constant evidence that in milk or other foods, hormonal, climate change, or media messages could be charged.
Boys are getting the same kind of time-for-the-old air.
Caplovitz determines the law that its main reason is the source of stability.
He helped conduct a study over 6 to 9 years old girls in 2001, who joins the body's age-time time.
Other results support the conclusion, but there are many other factors to contribute.
In this country, African-American and Husscian girls are motivated to get out before their adult girls.
There's a lot of explanation about this.
On global level, the image of time-economy from financial status, from weather and genetics, is affected by all things.
Other Puzzles: Although boys are getting face and hair hair low in age, they are not as clearly as clearly as clearly as they are.
Other doctors who attend the AP conference have supported the content of the subject.
Even children, and children's children, and the children's hair is grown up.

For the seat for the seat width, the largest ororators of jet design are on the ground.
This month's two-year-old fight for Assyria has become a hole in the middle of a long distance between the air-clas-clusion-clusion-corresion-clusion construction projects.
The debate is based on the width of the seat of the Economy class of the long flights, as never given by Erlenes but by the limited location of the place that it is claimed to be the key.
Early this week, Erbes gave a detailed seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in carbon dioxide, but it should be determined by the Arllins.
The debate comes between the plane design design, when the vast array of possible fuels from the Orbert’s longest - distance fuel system, which was discovered between 17-21.
How's the last section of the plane created - particularly what's the seat 9 or 10 is being designed with more capacity?
Boing says that it has made 406 people in 17 inches wide and in a row of 10 people in a single line.
Airbes says that with A350, it's going to take 300 people in 18 inches apart by 18 inches.
Air Durgy often uses advertising on technical matters through business press.
Now, with Eberbes 77 X, the hope to win over 100 Ordor in Dubai is calling forward public.
Recently, it's been seen that the beginning of the revolution has been something that these Phinehas showed in this way by showing it to the three together in a restaurant?
Airbes business chief John Lei said that "the long flight of long distance from the Binging area to the circuits."
As a change, people are getting great, but the way to sit on is not the way to change.
According to the statistics of the American Health Organization, during the 1970 ’ s when Boing 747 nine - year - old Boebo was described as a modern time trip, and an average of 40 - 49 - year - old American American males grew 10 percent.
According to the U.S. health Psychology, the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 degrees.
Airbes says that it has been sniffed from a seat in 1950 when the new name "Jet set".
Airbes says that the rise has been established, which suggests that in the width of the seat one half of 53 percent of the world's gold quality in the width of the seat would be better.
Boing argued on the seating points of the Airbes, and said that it does not depend on how the decisions of the designers become balanced between life and use.
It also says that the series shows that a seat depends on the experience of more than one seat's width.
Boing Krever said that it was really a fact to provide Airlines and show them what they need to do to succeed."
"They don't want us to tell us what they're doing."
They know better their business than anyone else.

In the decades following this debate, at least 700 billion dollars are expected to be sold by the Air Oror, in which the U.S. and European exports are enough.
For the first time in July, what's the seatout is actually the problem between the new jet planes.
Airbes and Boeing claimed that 20 percent of the seats had been committed by their newly connected Nin design, compared to 365-C-C-C-C-C-C-300 Air Airways.
Boing’s claims depend on a 10 - x (77 x 9 - 77, U.S.).
The unit's cost is now used to equal 10 times as much.
Kevin Canton, an Airbes Airbing from Europe, says "It's going to take control of the plane with our products, and more on more seats."
On the other hand, researchers say that the entire 10-C-Centin line present for 77 S is recommending that a number of players are on the side of the Deer's drive, which can also go along with the Cerrey.
Kien internal expert said my career, director and editor's Renvey Network "In the eighteenth half of the seat-side" would be very good for the passengers, but the fact is that this business of the Airbes is organized by the threat of 7.77"
Airbes and Boing seats do not participate but provide a list of candidates for Airlines.
Global jet vendors around the world also make caution of this group competition.
During the rest of the building, all the buildings have been offering high-surpassed fires for the lower flights of the jet planes and the local travel.
A 10 equals A350 but says it's not sold right now.
But until recently, Eberbes emphasized some of its major carbon dioxide seats in order to need more carbon.
Without the support of modern jet planes, it is not possible to fly on a new engine standby without supporting other devices, but it can be removed from the air of 77 X sale.
New anti-tunic nonsmokers can end up smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-unocentine that can end the fun that comes from smoking.
A single killer of Venxin was able to protect the chickens from nukin's body for all life.
There is another need for further investigation before the investigation of man, which may take several years, but in New York, professor Ronal Medical College, professor of World Medical College, said that there are immediate signs.
Professor Cornel said that this type of vagina could eventually help millions of people who have tried to quit all forms of smoking in the market today, but he found that their style was more powerful than their existing methods.
There is a non-virginal virus, which is designed to provide genetic information for the development of anti-untone anti-intinent antibial antibactes.
This virus, directly affects the numerator, which then starts to create a temporary structure of antibdage.
Antibdage searches for any of the non-native molecules in blood, and preventing them from getting into the brain before they get into the brain.
In the test, the vaxines that were later given to Necoton, they kept their normal activities.
The researchers say, but the chicken that didn't have been given was "good", was a sign that Necoton came to his brain.
This use was described in the journal Cyclopedia Medicin.
The vagination of former tobacco has failed because they had antibodza.
It was supposed to have a regular interval so that the antibodus would be set up, but it proved to be extreme and unintelligible.
But the price of the new vagina is expected to be too much, because it will make the electromagnetic component of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future's human vagina was completely safe, it could be given to children before smoking, so they could be saved from Ncoton's death.
But maybe it will be used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
He said: "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will find no happiness in smoking because of Necoton’s vandalism that can help them save their habit."
British scientists showed the result interesting, but warned of the need to be more researchable.

On 457 Viza, foreign workers can take a test from the "superiary" test.
The government is considering a "required" test for foreign workers on 457 Viza, because its purpose is to expand a severe action.
If there is a case, this test will be applied by a standard that is used to reach families and friends in Australia.

The British government has announced a study for the benefits of Scotland's benefits from the HS2 railway project.
By HS2, work represented high speed services in the north part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transportation Minister Barons Kremer said that this project would be "Britton will be one."
The Transportation Minister of Scotland said that they are very “resisted” by working with the British government on this project.
The first step will include the new high speed line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, the line will reach Manchuster and Leeds.
In June the government paid the cost of building high speed link between London and the North England and the country.
The British government, who was talking to Scotland Transport, directed the HS2 Limped to think more about the possible possible possible possible time and travel for North England and Scotland.
It involves three hours or less travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Barons Kremer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network that will bring to Ukraine and its cities."
We're moving along with HS2, because it's worth much.
Without this we will face problems related to our railway network's ability.
But this is also about the connection between 18 cities of Britain with Glasgow and Edinburg, which will be well connected with HS2.
According to Scottish secretary Elestericic: "Today's announcement is good news for Scottland."
For the Scottish government, Keth Brown from the HS2 network invited Scottland's "s public" back to the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high speed train is likely to have a large financial advantage, but it will also increase the economic load on Scotland in the whole of Britain’s high speed trains.
So we're excited to work in the British government's share, so we can check options for all to make high speeds in Scotland, to make profit for everyone, and to ensure the Glagog-Adder line, which the Scottish government has already planned.
I am quick to review the investigation report with the British government's experts next year and to make decisions on the next action.
Airplane device rules will be effective in Australia now

FA decisions, Americans apply to Ellineans.
Well, we're always interested in foreign development, which can benefit travelers and we'll definitely consider the decisions of FAA and the reasons behind it.
The effect of this decision will be different on every US Air Force Service Company and their flight will depend on the weather.
The air service companies need to confirm that they can endure radio communication with their plane mobile devices, as well as researching their laws, training material, Carri-ongeage programs and passengers for short details.
FAA said that after a Airlines' permission of their flight, he will allow passengers to hold up all high, such as having tablet, e-readers, and smartphones.
In low vision cases, the driver will guide the passengers to shut down their equipment while driving off.
The group has also suggested that heavy tools be safely placed under the seat or under the top debubs while driving and driving.

After that, the charges sold the land into hundreds of millions of dollars.
There, they took wood on the paper.
After that, the real owner of the land was eaten by the police and the government.

According to police, there are already cases of fraud and theft against groups.
The noise of the bomb explosions in Bally
The 202 people who were killed in the bomb in 2002, cried out at the sound of the bomb blasts, saying that the bomb blast should face firearms.
Tak, who spent about 10 years in one of the most essential people in South-East Asia, was heard for his role in creating the bomb explosions.
She can be released for 15 years when she was given the parcel.
45-year-old Armour was found in two ethylbes in the famous restaurant area of Kuti, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and a lot of people injured.
He was also found guilty of several other charges related to terrorism, including the series of bomb blasts committed in the church in the presidy of Christmas in the year 2000.
The organizers asked for life's pleasure, even though they could ask that the master of the bomb should be killed as a "corrupt man" who was called "corremist person."
The decision reopened the tragic memories of June Cortin, who lost their 39 years of relationship with his colleagues in the destructive attack by his colleagues.
When he stopped his tears, he said that he should be put to death.
I really feel that he should be punished like other terrorists.
Samish Courtney said to AP: "He should be held in front of the fireing team."
I have to live without my grandparents and my daughters every day.

Actually, this person should be put to death before anyone else.
To keep him alive, see, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and killing millions of people, it's not enough to meet 20 years.
He's the last person who's seen from Bali bomb explosions.
He survived for about a decade, but finally in January 2011, at Attaba, Pakistan, where the former U.S. army was killed by Osad Osad bin Laden for four months.
According to the report, the FBI agent showed evidence that the South Asian terrorist groups were in Pakistan in attempt to re-continuit communication between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and the Aleid.

F.A.O.A.: Air currents can now use gas in the atmosphere (LINE cell phone)
From the windmill to the gate to the gate, to read, to work, to play, to watch, to hear, to hear music - but not to speak with your cell phones - such a queries is the pre-arrange-destruction of the pre-arrange-destructional flight.
But the passengers should not expect this change immediately.
At a news conference, F.A. director Michael Huttarta said how fast these changes will be conducted, it will be different in each Airlines.
Airlines will show how their planes, new directions, and how the rules are updated by members of their driver's team to store the training tools and devices.
The FA said that this is already received plans from some electronic devices to expand the use of the mobile electronic device on the plane.
Delta and Zeitbu are among those who have already offered plans.
“ On the basis of the state of the existence, we can be very quick to accept the use of electronic device, based on the FAA, ” said F.A.
The passengers need to close their smartphones, tablet, and other devices when the flight is closed.
They are expected to not continue until they reach 10,000 feet of planes and allow them to be allowed by Captain.
The passengers are expected to close their device again when the plane is down, and continue until the plane is completely down.
F.A. said that the interdependence of the new-internal movements of the new-technelins that are completely safe from flight, they can allow their passengers to use the device when flying, when flying, and when moving.
Most of the new Airline companies and other planes such as this are expected to be used by traveling on high-higher , they are expected to complete these values.
Lora Glading, president of the Association of Education, has accepted these changes.
Gladling said in a statement: "When the security of the policy is done, we'll work together with the Airlines companies to do this-- it's going to be a victory for both sides."
When it comes to this point, we're like "Hal Monsters" that we've grown up.
Eggsy said, but the Internet will still be banned by connecting the Internet to at least 10,000 feet high, supplying e-mail, sending messages, or sending or downloading data.
The passengers will be asked to put their smartphones, tabt and other devices in the Airplane mode.
So there can't be any conversation with friends, such as the game game, which is known as game, when an actor was playing on his cell phone while playing on the door in 2011, and when the American Airlines were banned by them.
And the heavy device, such as the laptop, is still saving because their flight is concerned about another person's loss.
The cellphone will continue to block during the flight.
The virtual rights associated with the phone call are near the organisation, which is not near the FA.
Some electronic devices can be blocked while driving and driving the plane.
Last month, Mark Rosen of National Transport Security Council, who is the National Transportation Expert of CB.News, said that cell phone is still considered dangerous.
"The cell phone is really serious, not because they can create the potential fuel device, but because they can also create the cell phones in the air.
In order to test this point, the FAC-based project has proposed the last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic device.
In recent years the pressure to reduce these restrictions has increased in recent years.
C.. Clayer Macclec, such as D-Mo, said there is no valid security for the innocent.
Getting these restrictions is even more difficult because the use of the device is global.
Some studies also indicate that almost three third travelers forget or ignore the instructions to stop their device.
In 1996 the use of the electronic device by passengers began to ban the use of electronic devices in 1996 when the passengers received a report from the GVGGE and the high-powered electronic device.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on electronic systems than on the previous generation of planes, but they are also given design and approval to resist the electrons.
Airlines have been presenting the use of y-fi on the rise of passengers for years.
The airs modified for the Y-Fi system are also more likely to be restricted.
Hortana said that most of the Airlines companies should be set up to ensure the ability to use electronic devices for more use in the new direction-line device.
Modern electronic device, much less than the electronic device of the previous generation, celebrates the radio transmission of the radio transfer.
For example, the e-readers, for example, do not have the exact transfer of the page when converting the page.
But the transfer will be strong when a device is downloaded or sent.
Azaon.com is also among those who take side of the device to reduce the use of devices.com.
In 2011, the company's authorities have loaded their entire middle-in-the-old e-ideds into Airlines and have blown them to test the problems but no one has found such a problem.
The F.A. congress has expressed a mixed-symbolic emotions about the risk of using the device.
The Dutch King of the National Air Force said that they believe that the device’s system is real, even if it's dangerous.
Other members of the committee said that the device was only described by pilot in support of the fuel system in the Aircraft system, most of whom are very old.
However, members of the committee suggested that FFFPt allow the passengers to stop the device while driving in less vision.
The travel industry group has accepted changes and has provided general knowledge of people who travel to the latest time of the technology.
C. T.S. Trevl Ascor Do said we're happy that the FA has recognized that it's impossible to travel with joy, security and security.

Is the high class of Europe ready to engage in business with Britain?
In April, business for Britain was registered and was promised to bring and decide what changes to us regarding the role of the U.S.-based and economic development of the project.
For him, we set up the largest and most widely developed surveys of Britain's commercial leaders, and asked them what they think about the British business with it.
U-GOV for the idea of 1,000 business leaders who are represented by Britain's commercial size, areas and places.
The conclusion of this review can be a surprise to many people.
We found that a large part of business is now going to export out of Europe, and wants to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while members of the EU are moving.
They want the government to take priority of new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to be confused by the long process of improveing the private organizations of the EU.
When their ideas about specific policy areas, such as the president of the United States from the United States to the production law, most of the public leaders believed that the control of these legal rights should return to the Westminster.
The common market could easily be seen by businessmen, says that the price of Brazil’s economy is far more than the advantage of being part of Europe’s commercial territory - although 40 percent of the European companies were involved in it.
Finally and clearly, our investigations of business leaders found that a large part of the country wanted to move ahead of business relationship and political change rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was seen in the standards of major business groups, indicated that commercials are moving towards a "superving change" which provides the lost power back to the U.K.
It's very high price - the point for Britain to change and obtain a better deal has changed 16 percent to stand up in the U.S. side of the U.S.
The prime minister should not be in doubt: The investigation suggests that Britain's commercial, EU, supports their plans to share the status of the State of Britain.
It also showed that business, current power balance is expected to re-responsibly re-retrieving a simple change to support the U.S.
A better deal for British business workers is possible, and very fast it is going to be necessary because Eurogen, related economic and political organizations are moving ahead.
The priority must be the job and growth in Britain, as our research points out, that it means a new central focus on business and a new central focus system of Brasislava.

Before the charges against Jonathan Ladd were issued against two activists of Yemen’s crimes, the Royal Commonwealth reported:
In 2011, before Caringba's arrest was charged against Jonathan Led, two employees were charged with Baal crimes.
But in his speech to Job, he said that he did not present the case of child punishment within his organization, but he was told.
Chief activist Philip Hari was asked about the case in which a worker was accused of child pornography crimes on the USC, and another case that was accused of child murder against children who were in charge of her age in 1991.
M.H.H. said they knew them first about the case, but they didn't know about other matters.
He also admitted that the statement that "YMC" is being tested outside and found in the matter of the YMC security.
In view of Aug's statement that the YMC was banned, and this was received the first minimum rating in the school and the community section in the year this year's ability to record four possible ratings.
Mr. Hari, who is connected to the age of 21 with the age of 21, admitted that "My Self" operation has failed because of appointing Lloyd, and he was unable to make sure that workers are clearly aware of their rights regarding child security violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lloyd was sentenced to 12 children who were sentenced to two years in prison for crimes.
He was sentenced to prison for less than six years.
But Mr. Hari refused the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in WMC, which led by activists not to announce Baal security violations by Lloyd.
The workers who saw the breach gave Witnesses to spend time with the children alone, make them private, sit in love, tell them that he loves them and has to play their mobile phone.

According to a report by the University of Gravivivist, Professor Stephen Smboson stated that during the year 2009 and 2011, there was no security organization.

He was running on the ball in the whole background, and he did extraordinary things despite his seemingly small appearance.
Fantin is a creature of animals - he loves horses, tractor and field, and he has found two chickens he cares for.
The way he has started, he'll be in the largest horse scene of the year - and I'm confident he'll show a very good display.
"Fonton's Age is only three years old, but he has to control his tattoos."
They're very good couple.

I'm absolutely sure Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he was actually quite different.

Scientists have also given more light on the subject that has the connection between dogs' backs and their backs.
From previous research, happy dogs move their wings to the left (from the left) while business dogs move their wings to the left.
But scientists now say that couples can recognize this mystery and respond to it.
The study has been published in the Journal court at Beniloji.
From University of Toronto, New Scientist, professor George Wellertergara stated: “People know all of us are well aware that the left and left-to-right parts of the brain are involved in a variety of ways that stimulate positive or negative feelings.”
Here we have tried to see it even among other ethnic groups.
He said that the right part of the brain was responsible for the left handicap and the opposite order, and the two golls had different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react by other dogs, researchers looked at animals in the film of other dogs.
They measured the heart of the puppys and their behavior.
We probably don't have more time to understand why their pain sometimes disappears on the other side.
Professor. Wellergara said: "We presented dogs with dogs' films of dogs - in photos or in photos of other points that put in motion, and we could see each side of the puppy and show the side left or right."
And it came to pass, when the beasts saw a man's eyes, that they dwelt safely upon his left hand:
But when they turned their back to the side of the calf, their hearts grew up, and they seemed to be busy.
According to Professor. They don't think the dogs were talking to each other through each other.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience how they should be concerned and not on what.
He said: "If you meet other dogs many times, and if they move on to each other, it's related to more friends and less friendly behavior, you respond to the same experience."
Researchers say these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert at the University of Bristol at the University of Wieser University, explained that it is not the first study to examine whether dogs are important for dogs.
Last year, the United States of Link found that when dogs see a dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right.
In another search for University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “In contrast with Alliv study - when the hope of the dog on the left side of the dog was more likely to be sold rather than sold to dogs.
He said that it was because dogs didn't fully understand animals or robots in different studies.
He explained that it could help the study of how to react to real dogs.
"As many evidence of the fact that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes of the brain, more extensive information is still available - and there are no dogs in this case."
However, the easy way that their behavior can be recorded seems to be that we do not seem to understand why their two parties sometimes move on one side.
Alex Terror's disease had prevented Glasgow Günther's Glasgow

Pope France will announce the first name of Cardinal in February
Vatican has announced that Pope Francis 22 would create a new Catholic Church for the first time in his day.
In the Cardinal Church, there are priests of the highest class in the Catholic Church, their position comes down only from the pope, and they choose the pope’s first group, which will eventually help in choosing their leader.
Now there's a total of 2011 Cardinals.
In fact, after reaching 80 years of age, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the poll - it comes to 120 "carder election".
At one point, the president of the Vatican, Fedrico Lambardi, who said that the new cards will be held before the ceremony of the new Cardinals, called Popes.
Lombardi said: "Pupe Frances has decided before to explain his decision to the Pope of February so that it would be easier to plan other meetings shared with Cardinals from various countries of the world."
Jack Waller, a Catholic lawyer, said that the number of cards had been reduced by February.
He said that the pope usually announces the name of the Cardinal election as less than 120, and according to his wish, more than 80 years of age.
Valerio said that the next year's pope will be important, since this year it will be the first pope to choose France.
Currently, Europe and especially Italy have a type of picture.
He said, "It would be interesting to see what the new pope, even the rest of the world, would like to see.
In South America, 40 percent of Roman Catholics are Roman Catholics, but their numbers are very low in Cardinals.
In France, Cardinals is a group of eight cards from all over the world, which is seeking to improve the way of the church. These will be the first to be selected after they are selected.
The pope first made the decision of all things to himself.
Wellro said, "So French chose these eight cards to help her."
He asked for advice from France Cardinals.
But we're not in this situation-- it's definitely new.
Valloro said that the pope usually registers the bishops of the largest places, but French was "the most surprised" – so we don't know who they would declare.

The Wounds of Obama’s Continent
I promised Obama twice in hopes of change
They say that Obamah's great efforts have been forced by the opposition of the GVP.
Consumed by the proliferation policy of Oamara Web site, Dr.
Obama’s 2008 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses reminds us of what could happen
The National P. Morris Hard School is second-year-old students.
I'm reading too bad books today.
It's a book I think it'll encourage me during the second year of medical school, and I hope it's going to wake up.
It's called "the courage to go", and it's a memorial of the 2008 President's election campaign.
When I get out of my hospitals at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a place where politics inspired millions of people and could hold your speech.
The election itself proved, and the news reached a limit to the historical significance of that time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my relatives, and my father and my father saved all the news.
A group of young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008 he had 82 percent approval ratings during his becoming president of Obama in Obama.
And then I stopped the book.
The truth of the present is a hard truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they look like a distance, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
I really changed after I first voted.
Say simplely, none of it could have imagined.
I credit Obamah with a lot of available options, from the Fordor of Iraq to the return of our army, "Don't ask me" until Osam Ben was killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of resisting prejudice has prevented many of our efforts to move forward to our country: with public options for non-reconcilable, public service, shut down the building on Guantantau Bay, and other additions.
But the majority of the twelve in which I take myself to the Obama administration with my colleagues and colleagues-- I have the answer to that I can give them.
I've come to the point of political disappointment.
The opposition against Republicans is not the answer to foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to the drone attacks on children in foreign leaders.
It cannot answer the public security agency's personal life on American citizens' private life, nor can it answer to the act of activizing the wrong practices of the government.
It can't explain why American citizens of a street can't tell the reason for the murder of an unintended El-Al-Apala, nor is it the only public ban on public and private restrictions during the president's camp.
It can't answer the conclusion of the report, which says that the attempt to silence media by White House has been "from the beginning of the Xinxen administration."
And most recently, it can't even restore a simple website failure after three years of being signed into the order of the AfAddor Quarter Act.
I don't know what I expected of him.
If, at 18 years of age, I had to assume that the government could block the political campaign that led it.
Obviously, the unaided office is not a predictable way, since opposition will provide the size of our public talk, such as Newtown murder.
Still, the examples I have above appear to be most likely to be chosen by the administration.
This makes you the most upset.
I revoke back in 2012 for Obamah, but not because I was excited by his expectations.
Mitt Roman presented an uncontinuable and unequivocal option, which seemed to seem to be not to determine their policy or their position.
I thought there would be a second time for Obamah, who will be free from the pressure of the future choices we've been listening to.
Nevertheless, while Obama's order rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 in 2008.
Looking at him, I remember the promises they have lost.
One part of the book was reading in this week, which was described as how Christine didn't have a great deal of harm in the Ponscilian Premier.
In a post-merm Campon meeting, they told their obedient employees that they need to return to the backyard, and they need to remain faithful to their purposes.
He said, "I want to get back to my numbers."
We should remember who we are.
I can't agree with you any more five years after the President's death.

Mr. Parm asked for a number of electrons to move fast.

Why can't we have a system in which we're going to make our way on the computer, quickly, and we'll have an impact on the evening at 6:30?
Mr. Pemar also criticized using pencils to mark the papers.
So, because if someone does not love him and can be removed?
In today's world, the use of pencils is extremely rare.
The elections are studying options for electronic projects, and recently, a new mission has been published with New Zealand.
A 59-year-old M. Parmar said that their policy includes creating an international air-dependence board forshain Coast, and they have given their new mission "a very serious" action.
Public status comes for public service.
They said, “We are not required to commit this to anyone, except for the nation of ours, and not for any other reward.”
So the singers had to be put to trouble.
Referring to this occasion, Bar Association President Ramsesh Naji expressed a strong cry on the corrupt law-Rash Naji in the country.
He said the fast growing attacks on complaints and their subjects prove that criminals have become dissatisfaction.
They have no fear of the police and the educational system.
He recently mentioned such events on different places and said that when social society is not safe, the safety of the common man could easily be guessed.

Bank is a test of several years' hard-to-dotable messages and e-mail accounts.
The news about the test-correment has given up in the trains of areas that have been one of the most beneficial people in the training units over the past few years, but they have been facing the challenge of this year, because there have been a lack of risk-developments due to low-development.
Some bankers tried to force the issue to be handled by saying that it is impossible for a very large and extremely well-kivid foreign trade market to be seen, but the top trainers say that it doesn't have to be true.
The top tracter said that while foreign currency is so large in spite of a wide range of large scale between the different-granding trailing platforms and banking platforms, it means you can start to influence the market on small tickets value.
The news came on the same day that Cratet Sois had announced his X-Tanded Feeds Desk to be served this week, which was about $66 million in the last year.

A security guard at my house was in charge of every captain's leadership.
I've also got soldiers with me, but the guard took all my security immediately.
When security is going out of my home, I spoke to my best friend and Jilla SP.

Moving through clay, rivers, and forests to provide basic medical services
Dr. Georges Wells, who is in the rural areas of Cameroon, is visiting a special health service
Well and their team watch hundreds of patients every week
There are no more doctors in West Africa; only for 5000 people is a doctor
Give your vote here or through the mobile.
Dr. Georges Wall in 2013 is one of the 10 leaders at the top of the CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or other top 10 for someone to make the N.N. of year.
The winner will get 25,000 dollars to continue his unusual work.
For 21 years, Georges Well saw his sick father coming to the hospital and going to the hospital to help.
In 1981, James Well, near Yandya's capital city of Cameroon, had been hit by a car accident.
At first their hands were broken, but an operation spread to their brains, and he created blood transfusions that affected the rest of their lives.
Georges Well said, "There wasn't no Surelyrion in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, they took their father to a large crowd of clinics and hospitals and received whatever they could get.
He said, "This is indeed a very difficult thing,"
You get out of home at 5:00 in the morning that you'll be the first person to come to the hospital, but that doesn't happen.
There are many sick people there.
Some are waiting for death.
The situation has not changed since Valle's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, each 413 people in the United States has a doctor for every 413 people.
And if there be any physician there, the lot of them that dwell in Cameroon cannot lend him.
Two of the five people live below the poverty line, and nearly two third parts of health care in the country.
They say, "He's the only problem."
Because they are poor, they can't take pleasure in their life.
When he saw the affliction of his father, and of his people, he was determined to satisfy it.
The team of Dr. Georges and volunteers have treated over 700 low hospitals last year.
They themselves became a medical doctor, and began working as a lawyer in the center of London’s hospital.
And they started the non-lad organization Escovum, which goes into rural areas on weekends to provide basic medical services.
Since 2008, they and their volunteers have helped nearly 33,000 people.
Nearly every Friday they sit in vans to about 30 people, the doctors are bound by a roof and go into rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes no kind of kind with them.
They are more than one to drive out of the rivers and out of the dust.
But when they come, they actually receive the honor of the leaders: the best way to present the music, song and dance, and the community.
The native medical service in these villages is actually a reason for concern, and along with their large smiles and unsatisfied energy - it includes joys.
The next morning, their team starts to meet hundreds of patients.
They said: "We are more than 500 people at every time."
They come from the village about 60 miles [60 km] away, and they're coming.
They provide various medical services throughout all the week.
Many people are treated with malaria, typhoons, diabetes, diabetes, cancers, and genetics.
Others can get food items, donated to others, or to provide basic education -- the need for this document is lacking in college, but most needy families can't spend much of their time.
In the evening, the team analyzes a simple shower with localization.
Operation is usually done at school, at the office, or at home; after surgery, disease moves and makes it a place for the next person.
The General of the Group publishs the program into the room and the satellite devices, and they work on Sunday morning by morning and evening.
It's an ammodic speed, but village musicians usually help keep the team moving.
He said, "They play to keep us alive and to continue our work all night."
On Sunday their troops return to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, including the medical and foreign medical students in Cameroon - has been treated by some 700 poorly, and they know that their help can change the world of those who help them.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work because of lack of basic Harinial health treatment.
He said, "This would change my and my family's future."
In addition to working as a clinicalist in the hospital and working in the hospital, they also work in private medical clinics around the Yanding night.
He said that this is their second job that reduces 60% of their non-infected work; the rest of the personal contribution is completed by private contributions.
“I don’t know when they're asleep.”
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to earn money for their organization, so they continue to run these operations.
O'Malley, such as doctors and nurses from the United States and Europe who come from the United States and Europe to join their campaign, is an outstanding opportunity for those who can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In Jen-Septeural medicine we help hold a tool for Dr. Well, or clean up blood vessels, we are able to get practical experience."
You will never have the opportunity to do that as a second-year-old doctor in America.
The volunteer students usually consult with them to reach Cameroon, and they often come with the doctors of the charity.
But after reaching Yondadda, they spend their time with the instructions.
O'MIL says, "It's no doubt they're hero."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Well, almost the same thing, it's not hard.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made by their father, these are things that make them very happy.
He says, "I'm very happy when I do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to ease their pain, to make people laugh.
