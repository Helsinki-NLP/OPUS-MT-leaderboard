How long did you leave the shell bus for the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if it's time to do it.
Tom keeps his word.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some oil.
Tom's gone.
You go ahead.
We've been eating dinner all night.
It'll start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What is it on the floor?
football is a game.
The sky is clear.
No, no, no!
I really appreciate your generosity.
He told me he'd be going to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's walking.
What does this mark mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Am I too late?
Leave him.
I can't say exactly.
A medium of language holo communication.
Tom knows that.
I never listen to Tom.
How long did the next train leave for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to sleep.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not yet here.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you how much I want to say.
The snow reflects the cremation of Roshmi.
Come on out.
They shouted.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for the dead.
You don't have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're crying.
He made it.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my child food in the morning and in the morning.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please give me my voice.
Do what he says.
It's so tired to see you.
Tom started crying.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today's June 18th and Myriall's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We're gonna have to let Tom do this for us, right?
Can these papers be found in an orderly fashion?
I'm going to Oska Station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for it.
Someone is Chaslo.
I went to the poor.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's take a look.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of how I used.
I'm thrashing.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm thrashing.
My hands don't work well.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this the book of Tom?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could die.
Are you sure?
This time we have to go.
He's neglecting the school.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's just getting his head hot.
Wherever he goes, his dog will follow him.
Who's this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my turn to collect old bottles.
I like mine.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play a very good golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped crying.
How old is Tom?
Come on!
Stop jumping.
Was Tom there?
I've shed blood this afternoon.
My back is still hurting.
Where's Tom gone?
They look like American.
You were the only friend to Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My dad can drive a good car.
I'll be alone.
You need your friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his position was Jackson.
You know Tom has been known for more than I do.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My property hasn't reached yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom keeps his word.
Eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where am I going to get the station?
I'm going to kiss.
Can he speak French?
Tom could have done it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Not a bit more?
And one day, it's gone.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Call me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to call my property?
We do what we want.
Tom's right.
I ran away to my mother.
This book is for the students whose native language is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who will you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserved.
No one's worth it.
Are you here?
The rest are laughing.
How many nights will you stay?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I lost my property.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom up.
My son's getting business.
The sky looks like the snow can start tonight.
How much is it worth?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want to be empty. Tom's happy.
Those who live in the dark should not be the stones.
Why are you screaming?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his knife back.
Is Tom home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city has divided the city into a river Lobor and west.
Come on, look at yourself.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have your car?
Tom was playing the gore.
Do you have any idea what to do now?
He's getting ready now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How do these compounds work?
How much more do you need to give?
Everyone loved Tom.
What happened here?
Take your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's take a look.
Eat whatever you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken the bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't take my right leg.
I've been suffocate.
How old are you?
Can I ask a question?
What's that?
Take your key.
We've seen more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
The dog likes gorge.
You didn't understand.
My mom is hurting.
Sit down at the table.
He's younger than me.
What is your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's too big, isn't it?
This book is only available in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay for the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson.
He had a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone's out there.
There's no leave for students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask how they do, ask what they do.
Will you come in?
I'm telling you.
We like football game.
What are you gonna eat?
Good evening.
He ate empty fruit.
I want a new soup for these shoes.
Everyone loved Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He ran.
Even if the rain falls tomorrow, I'll go to sleep.
I'm hurting my right shoulder.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't get that train at 7:00.
He had two girls.
This is my wife.
Let's talk about it.
Do you have a pen?
The class doesn't start before eight o'clock.
How long do you eat that?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
What they did is wrong.
My son is too long from me.
Tom's parents were also musicians.
Here's your pay.
Tom's alive.
He's seeing him in the factory.
Answer me.
This is my bag.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat whatever you want.
Let go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill it.
How old are you?
Hold on to Tom.
They're thrashing.
You're crying.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like the magic.
He grew up in France.
She didn't work on Sunday.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Trojan's been killed.
He doesn't eat anything except the fruit.
Tom's father is a pig.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's a time.
I'll never make any mistakes.
Where's the door to the UA11?
I'm a dog.
Why are you crying?
Tom wants his knife back.
How often do you go to sleep?
The country has made a deal between themselves.
I talk to Tom in an empty French language.
Tom hit his eyes.
Can you just give it to the gigaft?
Tom is now.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's walking.
He's not yet here.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
Terrorists have left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I've lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has been rocked by Aykar.
Get out of the city!
Come on for three-year-old.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
That's what Japanese can say.
Did you see him grow?
How much do you leave the shell bus for the airport?
Don't argue.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need any more.
I've got trouble.
We walked on foot.
I want this.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom's just laughing.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm good.
They're doctor.
It's time for the plane.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the viewers were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom won a lot.
He knows where we live.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom blew up.
Everyone was crying.
I'll stay outside.
My mother can cook well.
They're thrashing.
The research was successful.
I think Tom's got the gold he has got.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17 too.
Here you go.
Let's leave Tom.
Eat your milk.
Both of us are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the falcony?
Tom's injured.
Get back to Tom's back.
Is Tom still angry with me?
Tom's gone.
We're waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you crying?
What's your father's name?
Look at that place.
Tell me if I do anything.
We tried.
Tom left in October.
The market is next to the doctor.
Good Canada day!
I'll be late.
What does this mark mean?
Tom got his head down.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blueness.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Are you going to go buy me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll scream.
Everybody's clean.
Don't let me die.
Who was it?
I'm Lazuc.
When I said that Mary was leaving town, Tom was really surprised.
I heard crying.
How long is your plane?
Orni doesn't want to talk about this.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I've got 8 times today.
Please burn the light.
Tom's injured.
I'm still your friend.
Some pages took me more than two hours to translate English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is this the least way to get to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Do you know him?
It's impossible!
How long did the train reach Yokohama?
How bad now?
The words that don't correct are not correct but can be added to a more general translation.
Your shoes are here.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Can you hear this train up to Washington Square?
We're helpless.
There's AC in this house.
You're gonna have to follow the whole thing?
Tom Boston's gone.
Clear.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
It's probably snowing.
I'm not proud of him.
Is there anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Are you going to catch us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
One minute.
Tom was injured.
Mary explained it.
I don't deny it.
Don't see!
Make sure that you do so as soon as possible.
Use it.
How long did the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand.
I've got seven times this morning.
I'm home.
Run slowly.
Happy birthday!
I'm in.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
It's so beautiful.
Do it again!
Tom started in the kitchen.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm hurting my leg.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking what you're gonna do on the birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you crying?
Stay right there.
Eat what you like.
We played the party.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've finished my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started crying.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy with it.
Don't come inside.
We're lost.
Tom's sniffing.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We're waiting for them.
How old do you think I'm seeing?
Tom's not happy here.
He was angry.
I don't like my coffee.
Talk more.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
We don't eat it if we don't do it.
I called my good friend Tom.
We'll never play better than this.
We're Lazuque.
The bill will be paid for today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know that it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
