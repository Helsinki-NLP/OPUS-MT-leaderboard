Black box in your car?
While the road pilots in the United States are struggling with a lack of money to improve the highway system, many people are looking at it in a small black box, which makes the difference between your car's map and your car.
The device, which guides every mile running by a motor-cooking train, has become an important step for Washington and State Administration today to get an old move for the current system of major roads in the United States.
In general, such as Highway Plans, too, a sudden difference between deep disputes and living cells.
You have the drive's miles to keep the drive, and possibly the drive- and then use this information to create a taxi bin - to provide support to the government in support of these Blackbox allows the government to use these foreign groups.
The Chinese party's bureaucracy.
The U.S. citizen freedom organization is also concerned with providing various forms of privacy.
While Congress could not agree whether the next action should be performed, many will not wait.
They're looking for how they can go to a system in the next decade, which will pay for every mile set on the street.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the block box for test drive, some of which contain GPS. Monitoring.
It's really important for our country.
"It is not a matter of whether we are selected or not," says Hassan Ikarta, who is the director of the South California government's organization, who is planning to start track every mile from 2025 to 2025.
We're going to change how to pay.
That's the technology to do.
The main reason is that the country’s High Trust Foundation is nearly out of Delhi, which is due to the cost of pay on tax companies by American citizens.
American people don't buy as much gas as before.
Now the car goes more than a milligram in a Galeon gas.
In the past 20 years, there has been no increase in the past 20 years, with 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of the gas, politicians avoid even increasing a money in the taxi.
In the Minsota university, the policy expert Le Mannic said, "It's not accurate."
Their kingdom has recently set up a tracking device in 500 cars to test the perimeter system.
He says, "It will work as the most reasonable option in the lifetime."
Venx is called the Melesage-based user.
It's not surprising that the idea is appealing to citizens, because, for example, it can change things to change in trade as a car drive, which can help lower and lower the gas gas.
Calculators from California are interested in this system while they are developing techniques to achieve a specific goal in the state's Global Warning laws.
But the head of the home transport committee, Rip. Bill Shoster (AP) also considers the most practical option of the black box.
There are also independent vendors in the Régen Foundation, who are on the side of a mile payment per mile.
“It’s not just that it's going to fall into the blind.”
People are paying more clearly for what they're getting.
The campaign has also supported the campaign by two former U.S. transportors, who have been granted permission to move to Congress in 2011 to move to the corner of the Congress.
Last year, the U.S. satellite approved a project with 90-million dollars, including 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural methods, those who represent people who have to go to work daily or to go to the city, the current leader concluded the proposal.
Yet, there are many states and cities on their own.
It is the most popular Orgoan, who has listed 55,000 drivers in the world’s largest use.
These drivers will soon pay for the state instead of gas.
Nevada has already completed the initial tests.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Ilynois is testing with trucks on limited basis.
And I-95 connected with the I-95 state migration department (including America, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), are studying how they can process the change.
The idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where 50 free cars were placed on the car drivers' cars shortly ago, the driver was very smart to think that the government could monitor each step.
In the Nevada migration department, Adald Khan says "Bog Breeder and other similar things have been a major problem."
It's not what people want.
In addition to the progressing progress of testing, the NVLU had warned on his website: "It would be very easy to convert these devices into a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a huge, unsatisfactory technology that must be spread to each person's day - to keep the daily record.
Nevada is one of many countries who are making every effort to get an excellent technology, with the help of supporting the state of how many hours the car is running, but not where and when it's going.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel easier.
The search for this project led some state agencies to the small California State.
It wasn't originally in business to help the players.
This was trying to enter the market by the Auto insurance market, which the drivers had to pay on their means.
But the device that it's examining, it's good to see how HIV schemes are, since it doesn't use and provides very limited information, which is being uploaded by modem at the certain time intervals.
Riyan Morsen, head of the Tru Miles, said: "If you don't track people's way and their location, they'll be more willing to take this way."
These openings of the Kingdom are some big mistakes.
There are too few spending and few of these ways to do it.
In Organ, thinkers are using a different-name option.
They can choose the device with neither HTTPS nor HTTPS support.
Or you can choose no longer a device, but you can choose to give it to the average temperature set by the Kingdom inhabitants.
Other places are expected to be sold by providing more assistance to the device than by providing more support to the device.
In New York City, tourists are trying to develop a taxiing device, which will also be available to pay the cost of the parking meter wheel, "approximates" will provide insurance, and will create real time data from other drivers that can be used to avoid motor-tack traffic.
The city's planned document states: "The monitor will be attracted to its share for the benefits that will be obtained."
However, some transport schemes are surprised that there may be all the discussion on payoffs.
Metroplanettin in San Francisco Bay said that it can easily be dealt with the problem by growing in Congress gas taxis.
In addition to having a single-time or a year or a year of travel, vehicles don't use too much gas to pay their proper share.
Randini Retcher, director of the Association and public affairs, said, "What does he need to do when Esperin is able to work?"
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Frontier Airlines will solve on the online bag
The plan is to work $100 for passengers on your flight board at Frontier Airlines.
In Frontier Airlines, it's planning to start $100 for a car-on bag and it'll pay $2 for coffee or leave, but the Wednesday announced that the trip can keep the whole disks.
The new car-on-one is for the bag of overhead, so, the little bag under the seat will still be emptied.
Frentier said that $25 will be paid in Advens, $100 will wait if they're on the gate while they're at the gate.
Frontier Professor Kate O'Maly said he had to take care of charge in $100 percent of the passengers' AIDS.
"We don't want him to be charged," he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second test bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to save the passengers from the shell as they can do what they can to do in Carri-on-Bagza, which is in the overhead. This means most of the space in this case.
There's a way to bring the passengers down on the flat board.
O'Maly said it's not really about buying new charge money.
It's hard to find the most loyal fans to find that overhead bunny has become hard to find.
The ones who buy tickets in the Airlines don't have to give it to passengers who buy tickets in their website.
This means that the next person in the line may have 100 dollars for the same bag, while a traveler in the line can get a bag free.
O'Maly said the Frautier's website and check-up process is being changed to confirm that the passengers know about fiscal before they get the gate.
The New Frontier's new Carrie - On Face, won't start up until summer, although one date has not been specified.
Travelers often express incontinental and other ways, but the plane service likes them.
They argue that money spends money to manage the bag, and those who want travel service should pay for it.
Many are looking for a sign on the Wall Street as a sign that many air traffic costs are paying enough money to cover the cost of air travel after many years of the Airways.
Most of them don't even have Carrie - on bag Chile.

"The boarding process that I saw in my Airlines Carrier," he said.
I was hoping to get out of the tooth and see a fight gate.
"The price was full and he said it was brought up by the bitchy."
Fretier's also following $2 for coffee, tea, tea, or juice.
Forntier is good that those who leave, or who take shoes, they can keep the whole fix, and this free coffee will only be given for one time.
It'll still take away the water.
In 2008, US Airways survey tried to operate for drinking drugs, but after seven months after the complaint of the passengers, they left behind and followed after another major Airlines.
If Frontier's passengers don't buy them directly from the Airlines, this step of Forti - is their own attempt to manage clients to their own website.
Airlines pays online traffic vendors like this for $10 to $25 every sold ticket.
That's why all the Airlines have been encouraged to go through an online traffic agency to purchase passengers directly from them.
Fretier, however, has gone forward in this area.
Many of the flights in September were often spent half a mile away for clients who bought from these individuals an online train agency
On Wednesday it cuts 25 percent of the trampys.
So, a 1,000 miles from an online traffic agency will charge a thousand miles from Frontier trip to 250 miles.
It's also that they allow to choose their seat for the alone passengers when they buy the Frontier website directly.
In the city of Fronttier in my home city, there's a faithful burden of customers, but it's losing business and it's losing money.

The collapse of bombbarder's death as a degree of deformity as the plane's degrees.
The airship and trainer of Canada and trainer bomber Werner Inc announced the loss of 15 percent in a clean way, and the third third in the train unit and under a low command and pressure.
The Central based bomber also did not present an update on any flight test for his new CSerrees planes or the plane to go to the commercial service from the next September.
Nearly a half a month after the first flight, it's just blown three times, asking whether the test track is on the track.
The result has been lower than the preview and has sent to more than 8 percent of the totto stack Exchange.

We'll have a new command for bomber Cesares as the progress of the testing program.
However, if no one is announcing any new order in months coming, there's no doubt that the market program will be informed.
The bomber hopes the plane family can now cut it at the lower end of Boing and Airbes market.
The first experiment took place in the plane March and was the first flight in September after the delay.
Possible crate waits for a test of a company's eggs to accept the loss of new generators and possible damages but as long as Cesares is in between 177.

The authorities assured the audience and the teacher that the program was doing according to the estimates.
"The testing plane was long-term compared to the weather forecasting," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it to land testing and software update was determined during the interval of the airport.
Each designer makes a different schedule.
We've decided to take a first flight and an update period and say what we have done.
That'll be all through that flight program.
The rest of the five experimental planes are expected to fly in the following weeks, the company said.
Still, researchers are suspicious that clients can start a CSeris plane flight after their first flight in 12 months.

New research shows that we work with total honesty and dedication during the morning.

There was found when using people from 12 o'clock at 6:00 p.m. when they put their principles on the roof and carefully answered the wrong answer.

Mr. Big, who sends a secret information about the police investigation of the co-concencent
42 - year - old Bashtat TikTokrboro announced that the criminal was a criminal
The governor felt that his secret drug addiction could be learned
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liberal Crown court
Mr. Big, who told Mr. Big to check on the main police check, because he was afraid to see people about his secret drug, three years old.
After the 42-year-old DTatatata broke its cokes, the malfunctioner gave Nell Scarboro sensitive information about his nascarboto's medical experiments.
The case was named "Bash", and its criminals were praised as "top Berif" was arrested in Scarboro after the operation of the police in 2011, which he represented in the previous Narcotics train.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarborough in Blackburn, L.C.A., in the house of the lawyer, holding three bags of cokes while he had gone out with his colleagues to the L.O.S.C.D.
The hair of Detita's hair, her bottle, and her credit card found that it was "anal user" of the detata A.
During a period of eight months between January 2011 and January, he tried to obtain illegal information about Scarborough and his cooperation from his colleagues.
At that time the police were taking care of all four suspects by the police as part of the headquarters of the LQSer, Cambodia, Marssidid, Bucksier and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people who were sent by the police during a number of printing projects sent to heroin and Kokkin, and more than 20,000 copies of prison.
The 42-year-old detat was providing information to criminals because he was afraid that people would not know about his coat.
The state of law in Blackburn was facing failure after three weeks after the arrest of the Liberal Corresponding Court in two cases after the arrest was found in Liberal Corn.
He's admitted about keeping the corner in the first hearing.
The worst time of the lawyer was when the police found out that he was in contact with the phone from February 2011.
The two spies chased the suspects and saw him coming home to Dita and with more than 60 percent of the toilets under the buffalo of the lawyer’s blouse in the Black Golfway.
After the drug was released, Scarboro Dittta was regularly involved in the phone, who went out for dinner in Blacken Rovers Futal Station, Ivod Park.
When the lawyer came home, he found that there was a nasty drug, and there was nine times a conversation between them.
The court has heard that when she was found in a test of "ann't user" on the hair of Detita's hair, bottle, and credit cards, she was found "an appropriate user" of Cocon.
Detta was later arrested, but she refused to use the Cocon and said she was talking to the suspect dealer because she was her client and said that their discussion was about "supervatory".
Denta tried to remove her wallet during her arrest, but they were arrested, and her hair was sampled.
In the police testimony, he said he had run out of his own house with his work, and his client had phoned his home for legal matters.
After telling what the spies knew about them, the court was told that the detat drug was called to the chief of the sequence, some of whom he had originally produced.
From the organizer's side, Anne White said: "Your president should be the best to know about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta has a charge to limit his position as a pro-infector on Mr. Dateta, to have more contact with his special client.
We're not talking about normal drug dealers, but about a dealer who is offering his lawyer a naval drug.
And some of their conversation must have been settled without doubt; for he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit of the lawyer's relationship.
As much as he could, he insisted on the police investigation so that they would be able to continue their virtual activities.
Mr. Ditta was insulting, not the honor of his profession.
He made a lot of gifts from some specific client, especially from Scarborough, and allowed his freedom to break.
Dita refused any wrong action and claimed: "If I were corrupt lawyer who I am not, and if I wanted to give Mr Scarboro information, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but I did it immediately.
But after hearing it, Mr. Helstad, president of L. L.
The cause of their cocontinent they broke up and became very weak to the objectives of the members of the organized crime groups, who used it to get important information related to the police check.
The teachers must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and trust and trust in people.
Mr. Ditta has been deceived by this belief and tried to save her profession.
The serious and organized crime unit tested Mr. Denta, where they were also found guilty of three cases of violating the way of justice, which shows our reaction to bringing criminals to court.
The case must be a warning for criminals that no one is far away from the law.
We'll find you and give you a review of the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison to be guilty of heroin, Kokkin and Vang.
Twenty-five other members of the group were sent to the office for a total of 153 years for drug crime.
Denta gave her questions and answers on her website, telling her that she would have a French job to become a lawyer for the death victim in the United States, to be their demean guest and to be their demean and incompatibility for their work.

The parents of a teenage girl in Georgia who died in “an unexpected accident ” believe that their son was killed
A teenage girl in Georgia who was found in her high school in her high school mutiny, believes that her son was killed by her son, the head of the family.

Benjamin Crum, presenting to Kinth and Jacques Johnson, said to Fox News.com that their son had been killed completely.
They don't trust death in the way Sherif told them.
Kremp said, "They believe that this is the physical rule and the common reason of the theory of evolution."
They think it's a guarantee for the responsible person or people to protect his son's death.
"They sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag"
The U.S. Prime Minister Michael Perry told Guru that he is a formally checked about the death of Johnson, to see that many of the important questions are answered.
What was the reason for death?
Did his murder cause any crime?
Murray told the teacher these things at the end of the afternoon in a journalist's conference.
I will follow the ways of truth. They will carry us wherever they come from.
My purpose is to bring the truth.
He said, "I think there's an environment reason for an environment test."
Morer told the reporter that the internal body provides signs that Johnson's death was due to the death of the “supervatory” due to his death.
According to Maurey, there was a different reason for death in a second session test.
They replied: 'A great number of questions, or we will be able to answer.
Morer also said that if he found enough witnesses to handle a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to check the rights of civil authorities, he would say to him.
It was not available immediately for a comment from the Londez County Chairf's office when it was called on Guru.
On Wednesday, South Georgia’s judge ordered the audience to continue all surveillance videos that were discussed by the observers.
The boy's parents say they're expected to get some hints on how his death was.
The CCD continued the instructions for children's life-in-law for schools.
The Wednesday’s control of the disease and the Stoptom Center led the direction to control the child's diet at school.

Parents of Intersex Keyboards can select ‘unblocking’ for their children
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has approved the third gender for children born with unintelligible genetics.
The newborn children will no longer be assigned to a man or a woman.
According to the New Law, parents do not need to announce sex for such children, but the law allows them to declare "unnormal" or "interactive" on the child's birth document.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents who can make decisions related to sex-interpretation for newborn children, and fight conflict against Internet children.
According to the BBC, an Internet man said years later, "I'm a man and not a woman."
I'll continue to be a gymnasium made by doctors.
According to the estimates, one of the thousands of children under the age of 2,000 is a baby who does not have a child.
They are intersex, part of the group of about 60 cases, which comes to the conclusion of the tests of sexual development, which is used in the general, genetics, or in general for developing gender.
It may have been Willis Simpson's Internet.
Ling identity is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when a gender-reference is not possible, it is better to use the best information to specify both gender information and to monitor the child's mental and physical development before it comes.
Professor Dr. Jack Dresden of New York City, who is expert on the issues of Ling-Pahn, said that the new German law seems "good."
Internet children create moral uncertainty.
He said: "Some people are in a state of life that needs health - care, but not most of the children."
You can specify a string without a shampoo-technology, and then see how identifying is developed.
It's not very complicated to know how a child will develop any gender.
No one can give a proper answer to why this is happening.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In 2011, the survey of the European Commission in the year 2011, Internet people have been described as different from transfusing people, since their status is not related to gender, not to the genetic design, but to the genetic structure that is not the male or both.
These features can be displayed by other sexual objects, such as the weight of the meat, the loss of hair, breast and length; the initial sexual relation and genetics, or the quality structure of hormones.
The report also provides lionsons to deal with domestic violence, violence, and discrimination by individuals.
Now there are special camps for non-interlaced girls.
Australia and Nepal have already been given permission to mark the elderly on their official documents men, women, or "tribution".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norri Me-Walbi became the first "international" character after winning the "infectual" law for life.
According to the Internal Ministry, the German port will also have the third specified as X-Axetic individuals in addition to M or FF.
According to the report on France 24, there are still issues related to sex in the neighboring country in France.
In 2011, hundreds of French methods from this Catholic country signed on the occasion to return to the "coloring policy" books from college.
According to the U.S. website Catholic Online, “As the world is going to go into such a state where it is to be chosen, but not by any means, we are taking the two and columns of beauty in the opposite direction.”
In Maryland, the mother of newborn babies also told Bebe Joann that she would like to see the children being given weddings when they were born.
He said on the website of raising, "There's a lot of stress beyond limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and accuracy.
Historically, children born with both men and women were called Hermphroditts, the name of the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And about a few decades ago, the medical world considered Linger as a slammed, and then it could be written.
But now, many people are struggling to challenge the morals of child-scientism, they believe that sex is a complex job, and sometimes even among doctors who don't know how to feel about their sexual appointment when they are grown up.
Drescher says "in the middle of the 20th century, it was called "mogical".
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the symmetry.
The current principle about the treatment of children with unequivocal genetics was presented by John Hepkins University, who viewed gender as unintended.
They created and argued how social and environmental signs raise the child - with children's genes and hormones, to determine whether he is as a male or as a woman.
But in a matter that is known as "Jon/Jun" in 1966, their principles became conflicting.
He encouraged his parents to get rid of the baby and to do the same as his red-fashioned daughter.
Dr. Dr. Derry said that she did the case with success, but did not.
At the age of 15, the child changed himself as a man and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresare said there are still some doctors "Follow that pattern".
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the arrival of the Internet in the years following the 1990s, those who have started to appear before those who have been "not happy."
The same case was with the 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with X.V. quality, but his Janang was unknown.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his gender was small, or his brother was too big, but they were certain he could never live as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s left body and anesthesi-techtist was removed, and she was born as a child.
She was given the female hormone at the age of 12.
He told ABCNews.com, "I knew I was not a girl."
I wasn't happy, but the question was very hard.
At 18 years of age, she was going to be with her.
But feeling confused and confused, he asked for medical archives.
This made him aware of the fear reality.
When I was born - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.D. who prevented his body from creating a sufficient amount of teststone, which made it impossible for his genetics to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he came back as a man, and he took his teeth off the teststone.
He's bluffed because of the shell-technology.
Today, he explains to people in the Internet project called Interfaces to make their ideas normal.
However, the modeling group of California-based Advocates for Infrastructures shows that Germany’s law calls "supervatory and rape".
They say, "Many activists think that the law of Germany will move parents to make immediate decisions and to set the child "resentment".
We're afraid it'll encourage opposition.
We think it's a better process to specify men or women while waiting.
But we don't know how the law will handle our role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said that their organization supports Australia's law because "it allows adults to recognize the third gender."
He said, "The elderly should be able to make their own decision about physical sex."
The German law is related to specifying it at the time of birth.
It's not a fight by newborn children at this time.
As adults, they can make decisions related to their body.
But the St. Erline Barz, who is a member of the party, said that Germany's law would provide both parents and children "power."
The daughter of Bartatji was born with male attributes, but she was named D.D.
Because his Anderson was wrong in the garage, the woman in Katty was developed.
His body has souls but does not have birth or dehydration.
Now, 29-year-old Katty is married and has a retroduction in the child psychiatric department at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she's bazaar, she hopes to be mother by taking a bullet or by the University of São Paulo.
He said: “This law allows parents to make their own decisions.
It gives them time and time to understand and use some tests before writing, “human” or ‘human’.
In this way, you stay right - raise the child, love the child.
You have a dear child and enjoy him.
We don't need to be a symphony-technology that can't be returned.
They said: "It's bringing up children in the process and freeing the parents from the continuity of the continuity of their parents. They don't believe they're doing better."
Finally, the baby will determine which is more easy with the gender -- and that's a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Consider the Bieddy Duming Obama’s campaign for Heili Clinn.
According to the New York Times, nearly half of President Barack Obama’s nearly as well as his traveling companions, Heliri Clinn, a member of the president’s office in California, was interviewed for 2012.
The most outstanding threat in the hidden universe is Mark Halparine and John Helmman, the 2012 Action Toum, which is expected by the 2012 Action Tom, "The Power Down: Change Game 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the next book, and the Thursday evening explained what would help Ombama to be able to reevaluate the election of the president’s top generals and pollers in 2011.
According to Time’s National political spokesperson Jonathan Martin, the book was fully researched in the activities of major authorities and put the White House in front of the White House for the Name, which affects the change from the vice president of the former state.
Possible switch was a very safe secret within the foundation of the Chicago Revolution and within the Oval Office.
With only about half a dozen presidents – the East Obama Action Prime Minister Msina, and the former White House, David Oxford and David Pallof, were concerned.
The "Wicken Down" claims that he tried to change the building, even though his personal team finally made a decision that would not improve the situation of Obamah from the client's ticket.
In an interview with Martin, Dolly has confirmed that the administration was actually thinking of the place with the building.
"I said in view of the whole view, and one of them, it was," said the newspaper.
Remember that the president was at the risk, so we were in touch with such "holy Christ," saying, "What shall we do?"
While Doyle said "response" as "responsibly", Martin told Anderson Cooper's choice to re-enact the choice of the CNN, how much more would it be if it was to be possible to find out what it's going on.
"The campaign like Paso doesn't spend much time on focused groups until they're serious thinking about something," Martin said on SCE360.
It's obvious, Halaki, or Obama knew their team change.
Martin told CNN that they were asking them if they knew their boss possible change?
While Doyy said that the president knew nothing about possible changes, former Chief of Steff admitted that this was "probably" that Obama knew.
"The Mighty Down" is not the answer: is it the political investigation to Obama's desk?
The Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know about the deduceing ticket.
" probably, Martin said.

George Carvervan: U.S.A.
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time, we are warned that free Scotland will need to join as independent as a free fleet in Europe as part of the situation of the EU.
The Portation Control on Burvik points out stories about the border of the Central Star on the walls of the Central Star.
The fact is that the StrathClied Paper described the potential economic benefits of freeing the rest of Europe with the rest of Europe, although it was not specifically described in the Headlines.
No one described that the EU members allow most of their time to change their personal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a square, Brassis will always be free to get whatever he really wants from Scotland.
So, then, O-Kahnani.
And the thing that's been so long-term has been gathered, first I've heard about "supervation Control" about 40 years ago.
Still, this interesting story was lost.
Why should free Scotland expect to sell Europe from free Scotland?
Why should London's gorillas have been processed for Brucees, especially now?
Here's the real European news: Great, war-fundament plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With Euro disaster, the project has been killed in Europe officially.
In all the EU, dedicated forces are getting enough strength to resist the EU or to turn down the same money.
Even in Germany, U.S.
The plan to build part Europe has always been opposition.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a real change.
With the harsh rules made by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people have had to think that the project has gone too far.
The vast budget of the national governments did not have a lot of role in Europe’s crisis – it was true in Greece only.
Rather, the Euro System established its members as a means of supporting German exporters - something that they want to keep up with German politicians.
Without the chance of the domestic exchange, South Europe can find itself in a fatal situation in which productivity is compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce the cost and public level - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
The deeper European productivity is diagnosed from the run-ups and on-the-floating problems.
In order to provide freeing French and German energy products, - as a result of the "hardy" energy policy, the European industry spends four times for electricity and gas compared to the United Nations.
It's going to be a risk, which we've already seen in Gingham.
The European Petromes ’ industry cannot be affected by the US. shell Gas.
As a result, people’s feelings of rebellion are stirred, especially in France, who have been the main fan of the EU.
The top politicians of France have seen the U.S. control of Germany, and Paris as a way to provide the equivalent of the divideding of bengington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political recognition, and this applies to his own financial policy in Europe, which causes France's economy to disappear.
The result: From the southern side of Marion Le Pine, the opposition National Front has won a third-time victory over the government in the recent subsidiary.
At this time in France is the most popular group of 24 percent of French votes - it is the deaths of the British Liberals for the British Liberal that they can't believe they can use their own benefits to the left.

This team wants to use the EU elections in the next year to create anti-corruption, anti-corruption, anti-corruption issues in the European Union.
If, as much as possible, the anti-corruption forces in these elections show good display, this can affect the European Union for the first time.
My view is: Soon, opposition and mutual opposition in Europe will end Europe.
Euro will not be completely finished, but it will return to the Europe of the " (Lord") nations as it will support the general dall.
German and some of its environmental factors can keep Euros, but France and South Europe will re-start their currency.
I hope that the U.S. will keep yourself away from this project in hope to increase the share with the U.S.
However, the growing interest of Vagton in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after this?
We can choose to be part of Little England.
Or we can protect our own financial interests – which includes telling Berlin and Bruce to separate at the right time.
I think Scottland can do better in the Western European system, wish we keep our own currency.
It would be easy to work together with other countries in Europe in non-United nations.
Otherwise, we should be concerned about keeping our financial freedom in the way of Norway.
In Scotland, S.N.P. government is specifically a political campaign in Europe - which is the most successful land in Europe - which has been proposed by the Governor of Liberty Darling (the activated) and followed by Tori-lib Demation in 2011.
It would be inappropriate for Scotland at this time to vote for independence, since it would have to be accepted by Berlin and Brasisles.
Time ago: Getting bigger
The findings indicate that African-American and Hasssan girls get their life at least as much as their age.
Physical changes does not mean that zero is near
There is no evidence that hormonal or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that environmental anger can be one of the causes of breathing in low life
The issue of sex is not as effective as before.
The former news specialist of CNN has been a specialist in the health and family issues of the children.
Should mothers be concerned, if her daughter begins to develop the growth of breast cancer and the growth of the genome by age 7 or 8?
This week, in Orlando, Florida, U.S.A.’s annual meeting of the U.S. Children’s Medical Medicine Academy of Academys, Dr. Paul Calplovitz explained that these early physical changes are common among American girls.
"I spend a lot of time giving the children confidence - that it usually doesn't represent a full-time development in the direction of the full-time."
The real symptoms of growth such as the growth, the growth of teeth, and the hair of the kan and the flesh and physical smell girls.
But in the past four decades, there has been a very small change in the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When teeth start to develop, the first stage takes at least two years" in Rio de Janeiro, which describes "time-time-old": needed Guides to solve this common problem.
It's the best test time for the development of biochemical growth.
What's the start of yawn's start is, but when breast development is increased before 8 years of age, two are called "ba-old."
In most cases, this process will be slow or stopped - which hair doctors can watch close.
In the case of more rapid progress, tests may be needed by the Andoceanolology system so that they can solve serious problems such as those of a team or the system.
There are treatments to reduce time-to-live and other effects: the time-old age of the bones, which causes the lack of growth and age, can be broken as old age.
Content for drug or hormone treatment, child age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional aging.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovits are experts about drugs but they acknowledge, "Tonching can increase practical points, and girls may feel separated from their peers."
The other big problem could be understood: The girl doesn't just want her little girl to be a magazineman.
“They worry about the risk of the womb, or how to keep it clean.”
A woman whose daughter had started a magazine religion when she was ten years old recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this, and we also talked about the magazineism, but she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was scared of her school and was disappointed that her first magazine religion had started in her friends.
There are many well-known principles about the cause of the uncertainty.
Nevertheless, there is no constant evidence that he can be accused of punctuation in milk or other food products.
Boys and girls are getting time-old.
Caplovitz determines that its main reason is the anger of the environment.
In 2001 he helped to conduct a study on girls from 6 to 9 years of age, who connects the flesh's time with the time of age.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hassi girls have the tendency to have sexual relations before their teenage girls.
There's a lot of explanation of this.
On global level, the model of time-first economies, from financial status to weather and genetics, all seem to be affected by everything.
Other Puzzles: Although boys are getting their faces and their hair low in their age, they are not as clearly as clearly as they are.
Other doctors who attended the AP assembly support the content of the subject.
Even children, and children's children, are common: and the hair of the beast is not known.
“We need to be aware of how we identify the real start of the Air Force at Garrebby Hospital, New Jersey, ” says Dr. Lauren Silverman, Dr. Lorens Silverman: “We need to be careful about how we identify the real start of the Air."
The children should not hesitate to take guidance from their hair doctor to talk to their children about this matter.
Caplovits advised, "This means we can talk before we're expected."
If you stay calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Girls who have been developing from time to time need to be assured that even though this has been already past this time, it is part of normal life.

While 7.8 meters of rain was recorded.
As the weather department moves forward, there will be clouds in the sky.
The vast order of jet designers for the seat width is on the ground at the big order of jet designers.
This month's two-dimensional continuity has become a barrier for two-century flights in the middle of the flights of space-cluss for flights.
The debate focuses on the width of the seat of the main eyepiece of the economy class, as always given by Erlinees, but not by the same space that the Latin jets and Boeing Company have claimed to be the key.
Erbis has hoped that this week's largest seat in the city of Econom Cabein is at least 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter, but it should be determined by Erlineins.
The controversy comes between the plane designers, when the possible destinations of the Air Force, located in a long distance of 17-21, became sold to the largest engine in the Air Force.
How's the last section of the plane created - especially what's going to be greater than 9 or 10?
Boing is said to have made it “77 X ” which will place 4066 in 17 inches [17 cm] wide and 10 people per row.
Airbes says it's going to take 350 people to the same seat as 18 in the 18s.
Air Digz is often involved in commercial affairs through advertising press.
Now, with Everbes 77, there is hope to be over 100 Order in Dubai, with 777 X.
Recently, it's been seen that the beginning of the revolution has been something that these Fincincorro showed this by showing it to three in a restaurant. Would you accept it?
John Lehi, chief of the Airbes business, said that he's flying long distances from the rest of the region to the circuits.
As a change, people may be getting great, but the way to sit down is not changed.
According to the statistics of the U.S. health department, during the 1970 ’ s, when Boing 747 was described as a modern long trip, and by the age of 40 - 49, U.S.
According to the American health statistics, in the 21st century, the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbes says that it is estimated to be the opposite of a seat in the 1950 ’ s when the New Name was the average member of the "get set".
The Airbes says that the growth of the resilient community has been established, which suggests that in the width of the seat, an additional 50 - percent of the seat's width suggests improvement in the quality of sleep.
Boing argued on the tip of the Air Force, and said that this does not depend on the decisions of the designers how the Erelias behaves and the Observatory.
It also says that the research shows that a seat depends on more than one seat's experience.
Boying Krever said that this is actually giving the energy to the energy and what they believe is what they need to do to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they're doing."
They know better of their business than anyone else.
For Fireers it's about room room, but it's a fast point for investors that it can affect the air.
After this debate, at least 700 billion dollars are expected to be paid in the decades leading up to the growth of the plane Order's competition between American and European exports.
For the first time in July, there is a battle between the new jet flights.
Erbis and Boing claimed that 20 percent of each seat has been affected by their new connection in the agency design, 365-C-Cinting Boing 77-300 Air.
The statement of Boing’s display depends on the comparison of a 10-77 x (77 - 9) base with a 9 - square - inch [77 cm] design.
The unit's cost is 10 times equal to the advantage now.
Kevin Konstantin, the Head of the Air Force of Europe, says "The Boing's plane is going to fight more of our product, along with our products and more resistance."
On the other hand, researchers say that the whole 10-centin line carbon is suggested for the current 777s that many passengers are on the side of the flight, which can also go along with the street.
Kevin, an internal expert in my carbis, and editor's Runve Network said "It'll be very nice for the passengers of the seat width of the 18th century, but the fact is that the trade point is carried out by the threat of 77"
Airbus and Boing seats don't refer to the seats but are providing a list of organizers for Airlines.
The web vendors around the world also make a very careful way to check this layout competition.
While resting, all buildings are giving high-level flights for the lower flights of the jet planes and space travel.
I'm giving you a 10 equal to A350 but say it's not sold right now.
But as recently as the Airbes stressed some of its jet flights, so much of it's affected by carbon seats.
Without support of modern jet planes, a new company is not expected to fly on the sound of sound cars without supporting other designs, but it can be removed from the heat of 777 X sale.
The new anti-intrinsic nonsmokers can end up smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-intechtechns that can end the fun that comes from smoking.
One of the same vexin's fans was able to protect the skin of Necoton for all life.
There is another need for further examination before the investigation of man, which may take many years, but the professor of the World Cornel Medical College, New York, said that there are potential positive symptoms.
Professor Cornel said, "We are very confident that this kind of vaccination could eventually help millions of people who have tried to quit all forms of smoking in the market today, but he found that their blood is stronger than their current methods."
In the New York, there is a fatal virus that is designed to produce anti-uninteractive information.
This is the virus, especially the selected cell, which then starts to create a permanent structure of antibodies.
Antibodds search for any nitrogen molecules in blood, and prevent it from getting into the brain by allowing them to get into the brain before they get to the brain.
In the test, the vaxin is given to necotin, which was later given to necotone, they kept their normal actions.
According to researchers, but the kid that didn't have been given the virus was "good", it was an indication that Nikita had reached her brain.
This use was described in the journal Cyclopedia Medicine.
The former tobacco virus has failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be a regular interval, so that anti-bodedz would be set up, but it proved to be a disgrace and dissatisfaction.
But the price of the new vaccination is expected to be a lot of money, because the coded cells will make an antibodies for antibodies.
Professor Christchel said that if the future human vagines were completely safe, it could be given to children before the desire to smoke, so that they could be saved from the Necoton's blood.
But it is likely that it will be used by individuals who smoked to quit smoking.
He said: "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not find happiness in smoking because of nukinin's nitrogen that will help them to save their habits."
British scientists showed interest in the outcome, but warned of the need for more research.

The British government has announced an increase in the benefits of Scotland’s work.
By HS2, the work represents high speed services in Scotland and the north part of England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transportation Minister Barons Kremer said that this project would be "Bitton will be one."
The Transportation Minister of Scotland said that they are very "resistent" by working with the British government on this project.
The first step will include a new high speed line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is complete, the line will reach the Manchuster and Leeds.
In June the government paid the cost of building a high speed link between London and the north England by improving 0.432.7 billion by billion.
The British government, who was talking to Scotland's transport, instructed the HS2 lymedded to consider the possible possible possible possible possible time and time of travel for North England and Scotland.
This involves three hours or less travel from Glasgow and Edinburg to London.
According to Barons Kremer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network which will draw closer to Yukon and its cities."
We're moving along with HS2, because it's worth much.
Without that, we will face problems related to our traffic network's ability.
But this is also about the link between the 18 cities in Britain with Glasgow and Edinburg, which will be connected to HS2 and better.
According to Scottish activist Elester Carmill: "The announcement of today is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Kith Brown from Mr. Carmill called back to Scotland's "s public" network on the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high speed is likely to be a big financial advantage, but this will also increase the financial burden on Scotland in all the high speeds of Britain.
So we're excited to work in the British government's partnership, so we can check out options for everyone to make a high speed in Scotland, to create benefits for everyone, and to complete the Glagogo-deburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning already.
I am quick to review the test report with the British government's teachers next year and make decisions on the next action.
The flight device system will now be affected in Australia.
It must continue to turn off your tablet and smart and smart phone while driving the soft-smuted devices in US.
US Air Force Administration has opened the options for changing the US Air Force companies to change their processes, so passengers will be able to read e-book, watch video or play on their device in the "Yuan".
Travelers can still do that during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to reach their e-book etc. when flying and flying.

Virginia, who is already talking with CASA about expanding the use of his infly-fly entertainment system, is already ready to follow this change, but he asked the next operation.
"We will welcome a review by CASA on the use of digital devices, because we really think it will give the customers a better experience, because now we have the virus in our planes."
Quintius said it'll be followed by current laws.
He said, "We can't use digital devices during flying and flying the current policy, and we don't have any plan to change it immediately."
FA decisions, Americans apply to Ellilines.
Thus, we are always interested in foreign development that can benefit the passengers, and we will certainly consider the decisions of the FA and the reasons behind it.

The air service companies will need to ensure that they can endure the radio crisis with their mobile devices, as well as their rules, training material, Carri-on bag programs, and passengers.
FA said that "After a plane's endurance, he will allow passengers to use all high-level devices such as tablet, e-readers, and smartphones."

The organizers were asking for life's profit, even though they could ask that the master of the bomb be put to death as a "scorpic person".
The decision revisited the tragic memories of June Courtesy, who lost their 39 - year - old daughters in a destructive attack by the terrorists.

FAA: The atmosphere can now use gas in the atmosphere (but cannot call cell phone)
It will be possible to use your electronic device to read, work, play, watch, watch, hear music - but it will not be possible to talk to your cell phone - such a master - is the end of a multi-production-production flight.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, F.A. director Michael Huarta said how fast these changes will be carried out, it will be different in each Eerline.
The Airlines will show how their planes fulfill new directions, and how they are updated laws from members of their driver team to collect instructions and devices.
The FA said it's already received plans from some electronic devices to expand the use of the portal electronic device on the plane.
Delta and Zetbub are of those who have already presented plans.
“On the basis of the state of Jozaon, we can quickly accept the extended use of electronic devices, ” said FAA.
Philal, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablet, and other devices when the plane is shut down.
They are expected that they do not run until 10,000 feet are reached the height of the plane and allowing them to be allowed by Captain.
The passengers are expected to close their device again when they are down the plane, and do not continue until the plane is completely down.
FAA said that the end of the new direction-linelines that are completely safe from air traffic systems, they can allow their passengers to use their passengers when flying, when flying, and when on the flight.
Most of the new Airlines companies and other planes that have been trained in this way are expected to meet these values.
Lara Glading, president of the Association of Information, has welcomed these changes.
Gladeing said in a parable: "When the safest way is to act-- and we work together to do this together with the Airlines companies -- it's going to be a victory for both sides."
When it comes to this point, we're so excited about the "Halol Monsters" that we're tired.
The agency said it would be prevented by connecting the Internet to the at least 10,000 feet of the Internet by connecting, supplying e-mail, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data.
The passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in Airplane mode.
So there can't be any conversation with friends, as the game of online Scrubbery, which is a popular event that, when actor left his smartphone while he was playing at the door in 2011, and when the US Airlines were banned by them.
And the heavy equipment, such as the laptop order, will still be stored because their skin will be concerned about the other person's hurt.
The cellphone will continue to be blocked during the flight.
The wireless device usage related to the phone call is the same as FA.
Some electronic devices can be removed during the flight and the flight of the plane.
Last month, Mark Rosenan of the National Transport Security Council, who is the national security expert of the CBS.News, said that cell phone is still considered dangerous.
“The cell phone is really serious, ” said daily, "not only because they can create a gap in the navigation-related device, but also because they can create a gap in cell phone to the air.
In order to analyze this point, the project's projector, which has been composed last month, has suggested that the government should allow the government to allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure is increasing in recent years to reduce these restrictions.
C.C. Clayer McClake, a critic like D-Mo, said that there is no valid security to condemn.
Getting these restrictions is even more difficult because the device’s use is effective.
Some studies also indicate that nearly three thirds passengers forget or ignore the direction to shut down their device.
The FAA began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when the passengers received a report from the GGV and communications devices that led to the use of the electronic device in 1996.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the electronic system than on the previous generation of planes, but they are also given design and approval to resist electronic surveillance through FA.
Airlines have been presenting use of y-fifi on the cross-of-a-browing height for many years.
There are even more obstacles to the banning of the Y-Fi system.
Horta said that most Airlines companies should be set up to ensure the ability to use the latest electronic device for more use in the new direction.
Today's electronic device, rather than the electronic device of the last generation's electronic device, is a very low rate of power transfer.
For example, e-readers, the complete replacement of the page is done during the return of the page.
But the transfer will be effective when downloading or sending data from the device.
Migrants have also been supporting the ban on the use of the device.com.
In 2011, the company’s authorities have loaded their full-in-the-a-rayed key e-readers into the Airlines and blown it to test problems but no one has found such a problem.
The FA counselor committee has expressed similar-symbolic feelings about the dangers that can be used by the device.
Duggles Kid of the National Air Force Association said that they believe that the use of the device is real, whether it's dangerous.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device in the Aircraft system, which most of them are old.
However, members of the committee suggested that FA platforms allow passengers to shut down the device while the plane is in a low vision.
The traveling industry group has accepted changes and has given them the general knowledge of people who travel to the latest time of the technology.
The U.S. Trevl Asswell Association said that we are happy that the FA has recognized that traveling with joys and security is unintended.

Is Europe’s highest class ready to engage in business with Britain?
In April, business for Britain was turned on and promised to bring the business together and determine what changes the U.S.'s consumers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For him, we arranged the biggest and most widely developed investigation of Britain’s commercial leaders and asked them what they think about their business in Britain with the U.S.
U-GUV has been a reflection of 1,000 business leaders, represented by Britain's commercial size, regions and places.
The conclusion of this investigation may be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of business now wants to be exported out of Europe, and we want to focus on the countries that are becoming modern and growing, while members of the EU are moving.
They want the government to give priority to new commercial relations with such countries as China, India, and Brazil, not to interfere with the long-term process of improving the world’s private institutions.
When they asked their opinion about the specific policy areas such as specific policy fields, most of the business leaders believed that the control of these vital qualifications should be returned to the Westminster.
The common dissatisfaction with the single market could be very easily seen, while businessmen say that the price of Brucees’s visas is far more than the benefits of being part of Europe’s commercial region - even the largest business that was held side by European companies, 40 percent agreed.
Finally and clearly, our investigations of business leaders found that a large part of Britain, rather than political change, led to a turning point in the way of political change.
This conclusion, which appeared in the levels of major business groups, showed that businesses are motivated by a "superving change" that would provide the U.S. power back to its lost power.
It's very high price - and the point of finding a better deal for Britain and a better deal has changed 16 percent in support of the UN.
The prime minister should not be in doubt: The investigation points out that Britain’s businessmen support their plans to report the status of Britain's subscribers in the U.S.
It also showed that business, current power balance is expected to re-contribution by changing a financial change to support the U.S.
A better deal for British business is possible, and it is becoming very urgent because Eurojogen, related economic and political organization is moving forward.
The priority must be to have jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusion of our investigation indicates that it means a new central focus focus on business and a new system of operations.

Scientists have published more and more light on the subject that the dog's backs and backs are connected to its modulation.
From the previous research, happy dogs move their way to the left (from the left) while Bachan dog moves his back to the left.
But scientists now say that couples can recognize this sensitive mystery of the dog puppy and respond to it.
The study has been published in General Kurt Bylozi.
From the University of Tretto, Georgia Wellergara said: “People know that all of us know that the left and right part of the brain are involved in a wide variety of activities that foster positive or negative feelings."
Here we also try to see it among other ethnic groups.
He said that the right part of the brain was responsible for the left and the opposite order, and two golfs had different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the explosion by other dogs, researchers looked at animals in the film of other dogs.
They measured and examined the heart of peta dogs and their behavior.
We probably don't have more time to understand why they move on once again.
Professor. Vallartgara said: “We used dogs to deal with films of dogs - in a photography version or in an intruder, and we could see each other on the side and present the side on the left or on the right."
And when the cattle saw that the living dog was moving from the left side to the left, they were safe.
But when they turned their backs to the north (relative dog): their hearts began to grow and they seemed to be baffle.
According to Professor Vallertgara, they don't think the dogs were talking through each other.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience how they should be concerned and not on what they should do.
They said: "If you've met other dogs many times, and if they keep their backs on each other, it's related to more friends and less friends, you react on the same experience."
Researchers say these results can provide better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert at the University of the University of Bristol, explained whether the first study of dogs is not important to dogs.
Last year, the University oflink found that when dogs saw a domic dog, they turned their heads to the left and turned their heads to the happy dog.
In further research on the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “In contrast with Alva study - when the hope of the dog’s left to the left, the dog was more likely to be comfortable than having the dogs come to its destination. ”
He said that it was because the distance was so different that he didn't think of dogs or robots in different movies.
They explained that it can help study how to react to real dogs.
"Since many different mammals have found great evidence that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still alive - and there are no dogs in this case."
However, the way their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not find much time to understand why they move on to the other side.

Pope France will announce the first name of Cardinal in February
Vatican has announced to the teacher that Pope Francis 22 will create the new cards of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church, are the clergy of the highest class, their position is only below the pope, and they choose the Pope, so French will deny the first group of its members, who will eventually help them to be elected.
Now there's a total of 2011 cards.
Thus, after reaching 80 years at age, Cardinal does not have permission to participate in the selection of Pope selections – it comes to 120 "Cdinal Selectors".
In a declaration on the news, Federico Lambardi said that the current cards will be held before the New Cardinals, which are called post-corruption conferences.
Lombardi said, "Papris has decided to inform his decision to arrange for February's Pope to establish the post-production so that it will be easier to plan other gatherings that are shared with Cardinals from various countries."
Jack Wellerro, a Catholic, said that the number of cardiovascular voters was expected to decrease by February.
He said that the Pope usually announced the number of Cardinal electoral sinners as low as 120, and according to his wishes, the name of more than 80 years old.
Willor said that the next year will be important, since this year it will be the first pope's election in France.
Currently, there is a kind of preliminary for Europe and especially for Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see what new popes, even the rest of the world, are going to make up the balance.
In South America, 40 percent of Roman Catholics are in the Roman Catholic, but their numbers are very low in Cardinals.
France's Cardinal Council, which is a group of eight cards from around the world, will be the first to be selected after it is organized.
The pope first made his own decision to all things.
Wellro said, "So far, Francis chose these eight cards to help himself."
He asked for advice from French Cardinals.
But we're not in this situation - it's just new.
Wellro said that the Pope usually holds the bishops of big places, but Francis was "one of the most surprising" – so we don't know who they would be."
In order to correct the socket, the GM invited backup trucks back to the U.S.
On Friday, according to a news from the USSO Security Foundation, General Mots Company, not their own, called back some 31,000 trucks in the Chiled Chiled Chile and G.C.C. P.P.P.C.C.C.C.C. to fix a low cost in the bank, according to an instructions from the USO.O.O. security firm.
In some trucks, the French seating system may be missing in the system.
As a result, the party auto-response of Hadd return failed to follow the standards.
According to an information put on the National highway traffic communications website, "if the vehicle is caught from behind the back, it is possible that the head restaurant, the driver will not be safe in the proper way, which could lead to the danger of injury."
The call back was made in the middle of September 10 from August 1 to September 10.
The GM truck started to be sent to June, and this shows the top U.S. Automac's most important lobster after the release in 2009.

Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange in G.M. is about 1.4 percent in the shade of G.M.
The Desperate of Obama’s Fabian
I promised Obama twice to change.
They say that Obama's great efforts have been forced by the violation of the GVP.
The policy of the ban can’t prevent the pain of Obmarker’s website from completing the drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 Yearbook reminds us of what could happen
The National P. Morris Hardy School is a second-year-old school.
I'm reading too bad books today.
It's a book I think it's going to encourage me during the second year of the medical school, and I'll have hope.
It's called "the courage to win", and it's a memorial of the 2008 President's election campaign.
When I take my patients to bed and go to bed at night, this book takes me to a time where politics inspired millions of people, and it could stop your breath.
The election proved unsatisfied, and the newscasts took a break to show the historical significance of that time.
My friends were tears of joy in the eyes of my friends, and my parents saved every news I have.
Young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008 they had 82 percent approval ratings while becoming president of Obama in Obama.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a hard truth, as it is to come back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they look for a distant memory, a painful memory of the lost occasions.
I really changed after I first agreed to go.
Say simplely, none of it could imagine.
I'm crediting Obama with a lot of available resources, from the Afadable Carret, back from Iraq to our army's return to "Don't ask me" until Ossam Benden died.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposition has prevented many efforts in our country from moving forward: public options for non-superving, health services, shutting down buildings, and other additions.
But the majority in which I take myself to support Obama administration with my colleagues and colleagues - I have to end the answer that I can give them.
I've come to the point of political discouragement.
The opposition against Republican is not the answer to political leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on children in foreign countries.
It cannot answer the question about the personal life of the common American citizens by national security agency, nor can it answer to the activism of the government's misinformation.
It cannot explain the reason for the murder of an American citizen without a tributary, nor is the lack of public office and private restrictions during the president's camp.
It can't answer the conclusion of the report, which says that attempts to silence media by the White House have been "the most common waste since the Xinx administration."
And most recently, it is not even allowed to reimburse a simple website after three years of being signed into the order of the Aford Carer Act.
I don't know what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I should have guessed that the government system, could review the political campaign that led it to.
Obviously, the official office is not a preliminary way, since opposition will provide the size of political parties and
Still, the examples I have above appear most likely to be chosen by the administration.
That makes you the most upset.
I revoke for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited with her hopes.
Mitt Romano presented an indictment and an incontinent option that did not seem to be to determine their policy or their status.
I thought for Obama, a second act that will be free from the pressure of the future choices we've been listening to for a long time.
Nevertheless, while Obama's formalizing rate is less than 45 percent a week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 by the book.
Looking at him, I remember their promises of lost.
This week was reading a portion of the book, which was described in the way Obamina Premier in Pennsylvania.
At a post-marum Camping meeting, he told his officials that they need to return to the backyard, and that they need to remain faithful to their purposes.
He said "I want to get my numbers back."
We should remember who we are.'
Five years later, Mr. President, I can't agree with you anymore.
The ideas expressed in this comment are Nathaniel Morris's.
Clyved Parr claimed that the benefit of P.T. Tony Abitat is a struggle for P.
Arabtist M.P.P.D. Parmer said that the President Tony Ebt is the best struggle for their daughters to be pregnant, and that they can benefit.
Marethi of the area, who is in charge of 6 million dollars, claims that while they have tried to answer questions about the struggle, she has tried to answer questions about the struggle.
Pum can control to four votes in the United States, which can be important to determine how to reduce carbon and carbon-corbons.
But Mr. Parmar claimed that only the well-being of teachers can be a struggle, and said that Mr. Ambot's daughters can benefit themselves personally from the principles.
Mr. Parma said: “They can have an important interest in vacationing because if their daughter is pregnant, they have a direct idea if they get away.
Two months after the election, the election movement announced victory by Mr. Paremer after the fall again from 53 votes of Ferfax's military seat.
Mr. Parmar asked for a random number of options to pass to process fast.
Tony Att's daughters are French and British.
Does the outcome of the choice should come two months later?
He said, "We must have a better system."
Why can't we have a system in which we put our own distribution on the computer, immediately vote and we'll have the consequences at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Pamar also criticized the use of pencils to mark the papers.
So, for if anyone does not approve of him, can anyone take it away?
The use of pencils in today's time seems to be impossible.
The election event is studying options for electronic media, and recently, a new survey with New Zealand.
A 59-year-old Mr. Parma said their policy included making an international air-destruct, and they would take their new work "very seriously".
Public status is for public service.
They said: "We should not be able to serve any other nation at this most important time."
That's why the protesters had to get upset.
Speaking on this occasion, President Ramish Nagai, a member of the Association’s Association, expressed a strong cry on the corruption-corruption system in the country.
He has been increasing rapidly on the experts and on their sides to prove that criminals have become dissatisfaction.
They have no fear of police and the administration system.
He recently mentioned such events on different locations that when education is not safe, the security of the common man can be easily calculated.

The highest trader said that while the foreign currency is so large incompatibility between different-gading platforms and banking platforms, it means you can begin to influence the market on small tickets.
The news came on the same day, on the same day that Cratet Sosi had announced his Xinz trade feed desktop to the trainer, who had lost $66 million last year.
The bank immediately issued compatible authorities and cooperated with its developers.
"We believe that the trainer has worked alone, and has been controlled."

Khan, responsible for the state government, said that their security has been removed for political reasons.
It is reasonable to believe that the People's Party, who won at PDP's table in 2002, was among the first to join the Ministry of Prime Ministers.
Slave Hassan Khan said I've got security since 1996.
I'm in a gang of terrorists.
A security guard at my house was in charge of all Inspector's lead.
I'm also a security guard with me, but all my security was taken away immediately.
When security is going out of my house, I spoke to the Glassa and Glapes.

Moving through clay, rivers, and trees to provide adequate medical services
Dr. Georges Wel, the rurals of Cameroon, are coming to the rurals of Cameroon
Willal and their team see hundreds of diseases every week
In Western Africa, there is not much medical aid; there is only one doctor for 5000 people.
Give your vote here or by mobile phones
Dr. Georges Well has one of the 10 leaders in the top of the CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or other tops for someone to make CNN the hero of the year.
The winner will receive 25,000 dollars to continue his unique work.
For 21 years, Georges Well saw his sick father walking into the hospital, who was not properly equipped to help him.
Jamal Well, in 1981, near Yonduy, the capital of Cameroon, was hit by a car accident.
Their only hands were broken at first, but an operation spread to their brain, and he created blood pressure that affected the rest of their lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no neuron in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, let him take his father to a large crowd of Clinic and hospitals and get whatever he could get.
He said, ‘This is indeed a matter easy.’
You get out of the house at 5:00 in the morning that you'll be the first person to come to the hospital, but it's not.
There are many who are sick.
Some people can wait to die in the face of death.
The situation did not change much since Willal's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there be any physician there, and there be much cattle of Cameroon, which shall not be able to give.
Two of the five live below poverty lines in the country, and about two thirds of the health crisis in the country is a private area.
Well, they say, "The only problem is poverty."
Because of poverty, they can't enjoy their life.
And when he saw the affliction of his father, and of his people that were with him, Wells determined to bring it to an end.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers and volunteers have spent the past 700 million free medical care last year.
They themselves became doctors, and they began to work as a Velcler surgeon at the Center of Sandy.
And they started an un-supervised organization, which goes into rural areas to provide basic medical services.
Since 2008, they and their volunteers have helped some 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday they sit in the van and about 30 people, the doctors are bound by the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes no kind of kind with them.
They are more than one driving, and are driven out of the rivers and out of the ground.
But when they come, they actually receive the honor of the leaders: the best way to present the music and dances, and the community.
These villages have the reason for the lack of medical services, and Wel - along with his large smile and unsanitary energy - it includes joys.
The next morning, their team starts meeting with hundreds of patients.
They said, "We are going to meet 500 people every day."
They come from village to village about 60 miles [60 km] away, and they come in the pendulum.
They provide medical services in all weeks.
Many people are treated for malaria, typhoons, diabetics, medieval diseases, and so on.
Other people can get a credit card, credit card, or free will -- the need for this document is in school, but most poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the team analyzes simple shampoo-technic with local proposals.
The operations are usually performed at schools, tons, or to homes; after the process, the disease goes on and goes on to a regular place, and the next person makes a place for the next person.
The group's generators publishes in rooms and satellite devices, and they work in the morning and evening.
It's extremely fast, but village musicians usually help to move the team.
"They play all night to keep us alive and keep our work going."
On Sunday their team returns back to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group - including Cameroon’s doctors and foreign medical students – has been infected by over 700 poor doctors last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those who help them.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work because of the lack of medical treatment.
He said, "This will change my future and my family."
In addition to working as a clinical-centurist during the week and working in the hospital, we also work in private medical clinic around Yonida at night.
He said that it was his second job that corrupts 60% of their work; the rest of the rest is done by personal contributions.
“I don’t know when they're asleep, ” said Katy O'Malley, a second-year-old medical student at Draxel University in Philadelphia.
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to earn money for their organization, so they continue to run these campaigns.
O'Malley's students who come from the United States and Europe to join the Vel's activities, which they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In the genetic-based medicine we help to catch or clean up the equipment for Dr. Well, we are able to get practical experience."
In the United States, you will never have the opportunity to do this as a second-year-old doctor.
The volunteers usually spend their time with them to get to Cameroon, and they often come along with the doctors of charity.
But after reaching Yandala, they spend a lot of time and direction.
O'Malley says, "There's no doubt they're hero."
They give their life for this organization, and their desire to help the people in Cameroon will never end.
For Well, almost a single job burden, it's not difficult.
Help others to live a happy life, to fulfill their father’s promise, is what makes them very happy.
Well, they say, "I'm very happy when I do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to reduce their pain.
