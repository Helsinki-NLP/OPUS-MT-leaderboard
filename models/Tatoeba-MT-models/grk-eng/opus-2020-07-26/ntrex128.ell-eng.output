Worse Members are worried they'll be confused with "mapets"
Some Members expressed concern over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Parliament of Wales).
This concern was raised in relation to the plans to change the name of Parliament of Wales.
Members across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour Party MEP said his resignation was worried that "he would be homogeneous with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In volatiles, the word "twp" means "hazor" and the word "pwp" means "waves".
A WIND MEP said that the total "not satisfied" argument and proposed alternatives.
A Walrus Conservative stated that his speech was "open-minded" about changing the name, but he noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "map".
In this context, the volcanic letter w provokes similar to the English accent of Yorkshire of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill establishing the name change, said: 'The final decision on any name that Members will call will of course be the same Members'.
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the Parliament as a Parliament of Wales.
As far as the title of Members is concerned, the Commission was in favour of the name 'Member of Parliament of Wales' or of WMP, but it is the option of MWP that was given greater support during the public consultation.
Members obviously propose alternatives, but the effort to achieve consensus may be a difficult matter for Parliament's President, Eline Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the way in which the parliament operates, including other rules for deduction from the Member's post and the planning of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name during the debate on legislation.
The Macedonian people for the referendum on the change of country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change in the country's name to "Citizens' Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people's vote has been called upon to try to resolve a decades' conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of the northern neighbour conceals territorial views and has repeatedly opposed his requests for EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, militarily of the referendum on changing the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change is merely the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are shattered as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke with, say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of the two."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socialised differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood 'salonion' where people regularly hang around."
As for the churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the responsible "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
The churches, they added, may be replaced by multi households filled with people who will not be willing to help the spaces of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, and therefore they will speed up the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who move to these apartments will become members of the church."
Both churches were built by white churches before it became the Harlem Metropolis of Black - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church left in the 1930s.
A church of blacks at a nearby distance took possession of the building.
The building was owned by St. Martin, a black church under Reverend John Howard John John Johnson, who moved into a boycott of the 125th Street stores, a basic commercial street in Harlem, which refused to hire or give promotion to black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishions took over the reconstruction and ordered the carving.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, proudly called the knick of the bells of the poor.
The specialist who played the carnival in July described it in some way: "cultural treasure" and "replaced an instrument of historical importance".
The specialist, Tiffany Inn, from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first string in the world to play by black musician, Dionysios A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carpet to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweather said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What has been happening in St Martin over the past few months is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the church’s language leaders, while others from the bishop.
Commissioners - the parish management body, composed of the People's Leaders - sent a letter to the bishop in July about their concerns that the overseer would be seeking to transfer the cost to the Commissioners' body, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some juries complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the overseer.
Shark attack in 13-year-old dive for gamblers in California
Shark attacked and injured 13-year-old boy on Saturday during dives for locomotive fishing in California on the first day of the volcanic age, according to principles.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Bicon Beech Beach in the city of Enstita.
Chad Hammel said to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the voices of the child asking for help and he came close by deafening with a team to get it out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just screaming because he caught a lobster, but then he realized he was yelling "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His whole key was opened," he noted Hammel when he arrived where the boy was.
"I told everyone out of the water: "There's shark in the sea!" Hammel added.
The boy was airplaned at the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
The navyist Larry Giles told the press report that the shark had been located in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim bears serious injuries to the top of the body.
Authorities banned access to the beach from Pontos Bis in Kasabland to Suamis in Ensinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are under pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is involved with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams putting cosmetic shelves respectively on those stores, designed with special employees.
In the context of the significant rise in the UK cosmetic market amounting to £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sales of clothing and households are falling, larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country and spread to more stores if the project succeeds.
The investment in cosmetics comes as the supermarkets are looking for a way to make up the space on the shelves that once took TVs, microwaves and households.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetic offer in 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series more space will also be provided with shelves with the company logo, similar to those of stores such as Bots.
Supermarket regains its own makeup Boutique series so that most products are vegan - which younger consumers increasingly demand.
In addition, the perfume company The Fragance Shop will try to distribute its products to two Sainsbury stores, one that opened in Crointon, South London, last week and the other at Shelly Ouk in Birmingham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend to buy small amounts of food every day in local minimarkets means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make people visit.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlets would be more like supermarkets, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl shops with more non-food services.
Sainsbury's put outlets in hundreds of shops, while they also imported some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported sales of grocery goods and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarket to renovate the cosmetic and pharmacy departments has resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a Boots consortium in the early 2000s, but the co-operation ended after a conflict about how to distribute profits from the pharmacy shops to the supermarket in the chain.
The new strategy was designed since Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company with 281 shops in Celesio, the holder of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, compared to £ 125, three years ago.
He stated that Lloyds would play its own role in the project, adding a wide range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the appearance and the sense of our rhetoric in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and the comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for cosmetics that questions the traditional way of buying.
Peter Jones: wild after Holly Wilby left an agreement of 11 million £
The protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is furious after the exploration of the telepartisan Holly Wiloby by the agreement of 11 million £ with the lifestyle company, in order to dedicate to its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoby doesn't have time for the clothing company and Truly accessories.
Their business was likened to Goop's Guineth Paltrow company.
The 37-year-old performer of the "This Morning" show announced in Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoby was an excellent leader of the Dragons Deen series, Peter Jones, leaving their profitable lifestyle at the last moment, in order to dedicate to its new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden TV girl admitted during a meeting full of tensions on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckyhammashire, that due to its new contractions - £ 1.5 million - would no longer have enough time to make the truly apparel and accessories company.
The company was similar to Goop's Guineth Paltrous company and seems to have doubled Willoby's property, which is estimated to amount to £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Willoby announcement in Instagram that he is going to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his cottages.
According to some source: "Truly was far from Holly Wilby's top priorities.
It was for its long-term future, its source of revenue for the coming decades.
The decision to leave has surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlowe ready to be sold".
Experts estimate that leaving the showr "This Morning", which is one of Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost millions of the company due to the huge investment in cushion and candle products to clothes and home clothing, as well as a further delay in its presentation.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, his mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband have been having close friendships with Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willoby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couples spend together their holidays and Jones keep a 40 per cent share on Baldwin's TV producer company.
Willoby's going to become the central person in M&S's campaigns and replace Ant McParlin in the presentation of the show "I'm A Celebrity" in ITV.
A source of Jones's narrow surroundings said last night, "We would not like to comment on his business affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He was joking about the criticism that he accepted from the media about a comment that some would consider not to be appropriate to a president, and his attitude so positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said, imitating the viewer's style.
"I didn't give up."
He stated that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the initial meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's nuclearisation.
However, the negotiations on de-nuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ry Young-Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "respective response" from the United States after North Korea's premature disarmament.
Instead, it stressed that the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"we're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We almost had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim gave positive fruits - termination of missile tests, release of hostages and return of the rest of the American soldiers to their homes.
While backing his unusual attitude to statements about his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a presidential look, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd have just 200 people here," Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia scan a whole island, leaving thousands of dead in their passage
In the wake of the Lobok earthquake, for example, it was announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organisations will not be necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lobok population was displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a precondition for the exploitation of international aid has been found.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not seek international aid, it is therefore quite difficult," said Mrs Subung.
While the Save the Children organization is preparing a team to travel to the Old, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff will be able to work there.
Mr. Sotopo, a representative of the national service of natural disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluated the situation in Palau to see if it would be permitted to contribute aid to international organizations.
Given the seismic vibrations that often affect Indonesia, the country remains unpredictable to the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters in Ace have been built, the same is not the case in other coastlines.
The obvious lack of a tsunami alarm series in Old, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are even more complicated in terms of administrative attention.
A floating hospital that had been parked in Lobok for the care of the victims of the earthquake is heading to the Old, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joco Windo was at the heart of his campaign to improve Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and made simple money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding is masturbating the administration of Mr. Joco, before the re-election of the next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from the persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets, using stabs, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sterridge of Liverpool equals Chelsea
Daniel Sterridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89-minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steritz accepted all of Sirdan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's finish with his team losing with 1-0.
Hit the ball on his left and shoot it in the back beam.
His attempt was very high in the large area and ended up right on the nets.
The ball finally fell over Kape Azarabalaga who jumped to the ground and walked into the nets.
"I was trying to get this position, to get to the ball and players like Sakiry always play as far as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sterridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Candide approaching, I made a direct switch, I didn't think much about it, and I did the shot."
Chelsea had a 1-0 head start in the half-year-old after the goal in the 25-minute Belgian star, Enten Azar.
The blue aggressor ever gave Meteo Kovajic a heel to this game before giving a shoe with a head near the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovachich did one in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Asar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defensive and finished sending the ball to the nets in the back beam with a left-hand shot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight against Naples at the Champions League team stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videton in UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The tragic record of deaths by tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832
The death record following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832, according to the country's natural disaster service statements, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the debris of the buildings that collapsed after the earthquake of 7.5 degrees that hit the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters, said the representative of the service, Sotopoupouou Nugorocho in a press conference.
The city of Palos, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of the demolition buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old suspect after murder of a knife woman
A murder investigation started following a woman's body was discovered at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
44 years old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Muse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police have asked the residents who saw or heard something about testifying to the police.
Officer Brain Ohiegan said: 'Research is at first stage but I would like to appeal to anyone in the neighboring area around John Street and saw or heard something suspected to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the footage of the dashcam cameras to contact us as they may possess information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a Birkenhead resident and was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they might know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where it was found this morning.
The investigations are under way as the police said they are in the process of informing the closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Meuse, trying to get back to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He stayed speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants were informed that they may have to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A policeman allegedly told a man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with tears on stage.
He's constantly repeating, "It's horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the police ribbon and one outside.
Policemen stood outside the ribbon and watched the building.
Anyone with any information is begged to send a message to @MerPolC, to call 101 or contact anonymously with the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 in Case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument that is affected by the philosophy of the "recording history"
His extremism would be poetic justice for the talivist destruction of numerous cultural and religious works in England by its fanatical puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr Creek's proposal as 'noise' and 'opportunity to rewrite the story'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "In this debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable not to target Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
The iconography of England’s civil wars was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps, the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the acts of Thomas' ancestor in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamos Thornikrot is a characteristic of his image during the 19th century and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as an defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century have divided the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is an identifiable personality that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also praiseworthy and memorable."
Pig-donor wounds lethal Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man whose last name was notified "Woan", was found with a cut-off artery in a blood lake near a pigstick on the market in Lioupanesei in Guitsou Province, in South China, announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig employee is preparing to vacate pigs on 30 May 2005 in Zining in Kinhai Province, China.
He was alleged to have travelled along with his cousin from the neighboring Uunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out open the door of a neighboring pig.
He stated there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The examination of the coroner confirmed that the weighing pig 227 kg had injured the farmer in death, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were bleeded and busted," said the cousin, known as Wu's surname, according to Guying's evening news report.
The security camera footage shows Van entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Ouan or his cousin.
A market operator said in the evening news report that the pig has been placed in a cage to prevent anyone else from attacking while the police collected the evidence at the attack scene.
The Uan family and the market authorities are alleged to negotiate for compensation for his death.
Rarely, though, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 295 pounds pounded a farmer into Wales on his tractor until the farmer's wife scared the animal to get away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was oppressed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a "motivation".
"They're just of a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are going to bring extensive rainfalls to the South Western United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the coldest water masses of the northern coasts of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rains in North Mexico and South-West America over the next few days.
The winds of Hurricane Rosa arrived at 85 mph, being a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. east hour, on Sunday, and were spotted 385 miles southwest of Punta Euhenia, in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low wind pressure has started to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa approachs the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical humidity to the north in the South West.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfalls of 25 cm in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity in combination with the nearing low wind pressure area will create extensive strong rainfalls in the southwest in the next few days.
Local, 2,5 - 10 cm rains will cause dangerous flooding, crushing streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of between 5 and 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Weights of 5 to 10 cm are expected in the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Floods are likely with rapid deterioration of the phenomenon due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended that you avoid any foot-looping in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfalls can turn the canyons into orthodox rivers and the storms will cause local winds and sandstone.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally powerful rainfalls on the South California coastline.
A total height of rainfall above 1 cm is likely, which can cause small streams of crushing and lips on the streets.
This will be the first wet rain in the area.
Some dispersed tropical boots will start to approach Arizona late Sunday and early early morning hours on Monday, before phenomena expand slowly on Monday and Tuesday.
Powerful rainfalls will spread to Fort Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October some intense temperature changes will be observed in the whole of the United States as the temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in tropical areas are still quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very intense temperature changes at nearby distances.
A characteristic example of the intense temperature differences between central United States was observed on Sunday.
Almost 10 degrees difference was noted between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moin in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent high temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In a large part of Central and Eastern America, October is expected to start at a high temperature of 27 °C from the eastern plains to parts in the southeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there are several chances of temperatures going above the average in the East to the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers attended Brett Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million viewers attended the conspiracy of the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Cavano, on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was alleged to occur in the 1980s, Christine Blaisy Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with television networks interrupting the normal course to overturn the last moment on Friday: the agreement by the senator of Arizona Jeff Fleek to investigate a week from the FBI in relation to the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that it is 100 percent certain that at a party when Cavano was high school students, she attacked while she was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Cavanaugh, in a charged statement, said he was 100 percent sure that was not.
According to Nielsen’s measurements, it is possible that more than 20.4 million viewers were heard on Friday.
The company calculated average television on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers did not immediately make available for other networks that transferred the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually makes it difficult to calculate the number of viewers attending a transmission from office spaces.
To see this viewing in its right dimensions, it is common similar size to what is tracking a play-off game or the award ceremony of Oscar prizes.
The Fox News channel, which journalists strongly supported the appointment of Cavano, was preceded by an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place, ABC is located with 3,26 million viewers.
They followed the CBS to 3.1 million, the NBC to 2,94 million, the MSNBC to 2,89 million and the CNN to 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleek became a protagonist in the drama on Friday.
Following the statement of the Republican moderate that he will vote in favour of Kavana, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters disapproving him as he was trying to enter the elevator for the hearing by the Senate Justice Committee.
He was looking low for several minutes as they demolished him alive on CNN.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleek said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would have more to say to the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks covered live hours later, the vote of the Senate Justice Committee on the promotion of Kavana's candidacy in the Senate's plenary vote.
However, Fleek said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the claims against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Fleek was fully persuaded by discussions with his friend, Senator of the Democratic Party, Chris Kones.
After discussions with Kones and some other Senators later, Fleek ruled out.
Fleek's choice had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have gathered the votes to approve Cavana without an investigation.
President Trub has called for an investigation by the FBI on the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Mai blames her critics for playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of the European Union's "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her in the paper headline, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticises the Chesters plan for Brexit, saying the proposal to collect duties between Britain and the EU was 'finally absurd'.
Ward Sims Shooting: Police arrested suspect Dieton Simpson for the murder of the player in the LSU
The police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball team of the LSU.
Dideon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned in prison for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have a video of Simms' involvement with Simson, and according to police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Cops tracked the glasses at the crime scene and said they spotted traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB working with CBS.
After Simpson's interview, the police said he admitted that he hurt Wade deadly.
His guarantee was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of the East Baton Rouge coroner released on Friday, the cause of death is bullet injury in the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the police in Louisiana a special working party, the police lab, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the area for assistance in research into arrest.
LSU sports director Joy changed to the local law enforcement authorities for "secure investigation and pursuit of justice performance".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m form raised Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5,6 points and 2,6 points per race last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Owil Oweed said that the team is "constructed" and "in shock" from the death of Weid.
"We're always worried about incidents like this," Owade said.
Emissions of volcanic ash in Mexico City
The volcanic ash emissions from the Popotenetle volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the inhabitants of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, since the activity in the crater reached its peak by recording 183 emissions of gases and ash over 24 hours.
The Centre watched several signs and small seismic vibrations.
Icons on social media show windshield car covered with thin ash layers in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Sochimilko.
The geophysicals observed an increase in volcanic activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1 hitter earthquake took place in Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as the "Don Gojo", has been active since 1994.
Police forces conflict with Catalan separators in view of the election anniversary of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a conflict of protesters in favour of independence with the recovery units of the order, as thousands participated in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on the Catalan that caused polarization.
A group of masked protesters in favour of independence, which was held up by the recovery units of order, evacuated eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Complications were also noted later during the day with the policemen using their blogs to dismantle the complications.
For hours Catalan supporters’ teams of independence were yelling the slogan "we don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of protesters in favour of the unity of the country called "Love Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with micro-patients that took place during the protests, according to the local formula.
The tensions remain high in the region which supports independence one year after the referendum was declared on 1 October as an illegal one from Madrid, but are being celebrated by the separatists Catalan.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the turnout was low with those standing against independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year, following the attempt by the police authorities to discontinue the vote on electoral centres in the area where violent clashes occurred.
Groups in favour of independence sped up on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for national police.
The protest took place other things had to take a different turn.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who took part in the demonstrations of independence with his wife, said that it no longer allowed hope for Catalonia's prospects to win its independence.
"We've lived one of our brightest times.
I saw my parents with tears of joy they managed to vote, but now the situation is sturdy," he said.
Although they marked a victory of vital importance, although limited in regional elections last December, Catalan parties in favour of independence fought to maintain their strength this year, with many of their well-known leaders being self-determination or held pending their trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Poots, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded in his cell phone protests for the police, said the conflicts were fuelled by politicians of both camps.
"The tension is escalating more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oril Zuncarras, one of nine Catalan leaders who were confiscated last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for the following year.
"My candidate to European elections is the best way to denounce the oppression of democratic values and the oppression that we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonteri: Symbol man after car attack at a home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated car impacts in a residence in London.
The incident was unfolded at Bolinagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blomings said there were damages on the gates and in the building itself.
There may have been some shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit gave Livingston victory 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The Promised Liveston surprised the Rangers by giving Stephen Jerard just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Improx group.
Dolly Mega's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Himperian in second place.
Jerard's team stays without winning the championship for this season and faces the Harts, who have the lead with eight points next Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna at Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston in the meantime continues her race in six games in her class, with the main coach Holt still no defeat since Kenny Miller replaced her last month.
Liveston loses chances towards visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before it scores, with her implicitness bringing the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took a head start and almost reached the end just before the end, but Alan Lithgou removed his attempt to slip Craig Hulckett's head off the end.
Footballers willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could live the visitors in free strikes and the horns.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Rangers were unable to stop a free hit and Livingston opened the door, Declan Gallagher and Robinson co-operated to send the ball to Menga, who took all and scored from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball's possession, but they found uninterrupted the defense of the fieldmen, and the state guard Liam Kelly didn't face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelo had removed the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was cut off from the Rangers' legs, Alan McGregor, and all of Lithgo left out in another free shot of Livingston.
There have been many verticals in the area of Livingston and they have been constantly dismantled, while two penals were asked for - after the call from Hallett's ball against Glen Midleton's alternate player and one for hand - who have been rejected.
"Excellent game" from Livingstone - analysis
Alader Lamont from BBC Scotland on the court of Tony Macaroni Arena
Thematic performances and results for Livingstone.
All of them were excellent, overcoming expectations on this upward course.
The game style and their personality changed very little after their return to top formats, but the credits should also be given to Holt for the pushing team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Hallett was excellent, improvising an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrell alert all over the game.
The Rangers, on the contrary, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they did not respond to these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once succeeded in crossing the defense of the stadium and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of ranking.
Mixed emotions at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the Heads of State of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had broken up with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police have ruled out for security reasons the gathering of the crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have been able to approach to see their president closely.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish-German as heroes and others as dictator.
Car accident in Detfort: bike death after car collision
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the junction of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street road, a busy road in Detfort, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car was stopped and the rescuers of the ambulance tried to help, but the man lost his life on the ground.
The collision occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a bike, who lost his life on Tsilders Street, about 1,6 miles from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are trying to identify the man and to inform their closest relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been excavated, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Larine prisoners: Six policemen injured in complications
Six officers were injured in turbulences that broke out in the high-security men's prisons, according to the statements made by the police department.
The riots broke out in the prisons of His Majesty Long Larine in Warstershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still under way.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been recruited to deal with the riots, which are involved in eight prisoners and which were displayed in a ward.
Cops were hospitalized by micro-branching in the face during the clashes.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel took over the incident in His Majesty Long Laurine's prisons.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may carry out a greater sentence."
In the prisons of His Majesty Long Larine more than 500 prisoners are held, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the police officer was hospitalized in a hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, the rehabilitation units were called to prison to make serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City with sudden flooding (the areas with drought may benefit)
It is rare a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but this is just possible to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remains of Roza hurricane will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing floods to their past.
The National Meteorological Office has already issued emergency flood notices on Monday and Tuesday from the West Arizona to the south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix cities, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where he will be late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service pointed out on its tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have remained in a tropical storm or low barometer state at a distance of less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the US National Hurricane Centre provide for rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the South-West States, including the main Brax Mountains and Grat Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to be observed, with the possibility of total rain tumors of up to 4 inches.
For the areas that are not at risk from the floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing as the area is drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwest States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought," said the waterer.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the land in Baja California, Mexico.
Maintaining the tension of the hurricane, on Sunday morning Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugene, Mexico, with maximum winds of 85 miles an hour and will move north at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the land in Mexico with a tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
There may be a serious rainfall in areas in Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
"A total rains of 3 to 6 inches from Baha California to the northwest Sea are expected to reach up to 10 inches, according to the water.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and arrive at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona to arrive at southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or its residues is the very intense rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the South-West States of the United States," said the U.S. National Cup.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flooding and mud scars in deserts and landslides in mountain soils.
Attack at Mindsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted homicide
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspected homicide after tracking down a 16-year-old who brought a knife wound to Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Exelier Area of Minsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Randstock, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are appealing to anyone who may have recorded on a video on his cell phone what happened.
Trub says that Cavanaugh "deceived the misery and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Cavano is a vote for the rejection of the merciless and extremist tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a gathering in Wing of Western Virginia.
Trab said that Cavanaugh " experienced the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of highlighting it as a candidate.
Cavanaugh submitted to Congress on Thursday, declaring and resenting Cristine Blaisy Ford's claims that she was sexually attacking her when they were teenagers.
Ford also filed a hearing on its allegations.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw Cavana's majestic, quality and courage that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh's candidacy is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our day, a law with an excellent public service course," he said to the multitude of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the candidacy of Cavana, while he was talking about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the mid-term elections.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction mission".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Cavano is expected to take place no later than Friday, told CNN a senior supporter of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the total number of victims is projected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were taken away from the giant waves that swept on the coasts, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulauces, Indonesia, the authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palos on Friday, when waves of six meters hit the lands of sourup, drifting many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
"When the threat to tsunami occurred yesterday, the world was still on the beach and did not run immediately, so and was hit by it," said Sputo Purgo Nougrocho, a representative of the BNPB disaster management service of Indonesia, informing Jakarta.
"Tsunami came not alone, dragged cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land," Nugorocho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed up trees to escape tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palau.
Aerial photographies published by the disaster management service show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have been destroyed and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Metabolisms continued to affect the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Service reported in a statement that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have increased the size of tsunami, he said.
Nugoho described the damage as "extended" and reported that hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
He said that the remains of the victims were found trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugocho said that the victims and the damage may be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Palo, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
The communication systems have gone completely and there's no information from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers head towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get worse even more," he said.
Successful criticism was exercised at the Office on Saturday because he did not inform that tsunami had affected the Old, even though the waves had reached the time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video notified on social media, it sounds like a man on the upper floor of a building shouting panic trying to warn people down on the street for the tsunami coming.
Within minutes, a water wall is impacting on the shore, drifting homes and cars.
Reuters agency was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great deal of power cuts, which also interrupted communications in the wider Pales region, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from the authorities.
The military started sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but displaced persons still need desperate food and other basic species of first need.
The airport of the city was reopened only to help help the aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Windo's been scheduled for evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
Tsunami's victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
It's too bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to get safely to the city of Palos, where employees found shelters in accommodations from musame camps set in their office, Mr Dosheba said.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
It's too bad.
While some aid teams took over the sad task to start the relief process for the injured, some denounce that no foreigners, particularly experienced workers in the field of aid were allowed to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesia's regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start if the place of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross, said.
"When the government says this is a national disaster, we can call for international assistance, but there is no decision yet."
As the second day passed in Palos after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who are still ignorant that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less zealous.
On Saturday, a little boy came back from a sewer.
On Sunday, you rescued a woman who was trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Genton Subantino, coach of Indonesia's National Paratroop Group, had trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games, who completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Maddagi, were his students.
"As previously in the sport of the parachuting slope, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Genton was told how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of parachutists was released, he started sending desperately WhatsApp messages to his opponents in the Old who participated in the beach festival.
However, the reading next to his messages was a gray symbol "n", instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves seconded $26,750 during the supply of automatic takeover machine to Newport in Levi.
Friday morning, thieves extracted $26.750 from a Brink's clerk employee who was refuelling ATM machine in Newport as Levi, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver had evacuated an ATM machine at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Officer Dennis McCarthy told the announcement.
While he was busy, another man "was running behind Brink's clerk" employee and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leave the point, according to the announcement, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the event.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Kanay West: Rapper changes his name to Yo
Raper Kane West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing the change of Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, he's been listening to the cavalry Son and used this nickname as a title in his eighth album, released in June.
The change preceded his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album called Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grade, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", as the creator of the show said.
Besides being a short description of the professional name we are using today, West had previously stated that the word is of religious importance to him.
"I think the word "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you", West said in a conversation about the title of his album with the Bing Boy radio producer.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Canary, which means "the only one," to Yo, which is just a reflection of good, evil, confused ourselves, of everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the several famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known to have various names, such as Puff Dandi, P. Diddy or Dindy, but he announced this year that he prefers the names of Lav and Brave Lav.
A former West partner, JEI-Z, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without any other capital letters.
Mexico's elected President swears he won't use the army against the civilians.
Mexican-elected President Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military violence against citizens as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody student repression.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Talloko Plaza that he would never use the army to swallow the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops shot against a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when the left student movements were gaining roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support the new Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities pressure young people towards criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount spent on research in this area, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to be added to communications from various parts of the US Government regarding artificial intelligence, as the USA does not overall have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all other countries are so low in the United States and we are seeking to make the next significant discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Li said.
The double-checking of the budget could double the chances of taking place in the United States the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, said Lee in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The superpowers of Artistic Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order) released this month since Houghton Miflin Harcourt, is Managing Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading intellectual companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a system of artificial intelligence that won the best American Ottolo player, and later he was executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Annex to China.
Li acknowledged the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the Call for Robotics of the Advanced Defence Research Service (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get state subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic space, it's the companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Liy argued that changes in migration policy could also help the United States to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think there should be an automatic green card offered to doctoral diplomats in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the Artificial Intelligence of Next Genia in July 2017.
The China National Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding for people in academic institutions as the National Institute of Sciences and other governmental organisations share money with American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Common Centre of Intelligence, to which partners will be integrated from business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Foundation is currently investing more than 100 million dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there has been no progress in US legislation for months to create a National Intelligence Commission.
Macedonian citizens are holding a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Macedonia's people took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed to "Macedonia of North Macedonia", a move that would solve a decades' conflict with Greece that had blocked the country's membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour country represents an appeal on its territories and has exercised veto on its way to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but national rivals say that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign have raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the required 50 percent to be valid.
The question on the list was: "You are in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece".
The proponents of a name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to be paid to organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the country's future, so that Macedonian young people can live under the umbrella of the European Union, because so the lives of all of us will be safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of Parliament have said they will comply with the result of the vote to make it definitive.
A change in name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Committee said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 pm.
However, participation reached only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when it gave the present 66 per cent of the voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said Joze Tanevski, 62, voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaev, Zorika's wife and his son Dusko voted in the referendum on changing the country's name that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in the city of Stromika, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head high, not as second-class partners," Garvardkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of the eupheatic union."
Prime Minister Zafe said NATO would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate exceeding 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zafe said.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Research, in the referendum would have been held from 30 to 43 per cent of voters, which is less than required to participate.
According to another poll held by the Macedonian Telema TV station, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said he would vote positively.
To achieve the referendum, participation must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-western government, from its rise to power last May.
Watch out: Manchester City Sergei passes through Brighton's defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling constituted Brighton's defense by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday in Etihad Steinium in Manchester, England.
Aguerio showed to score fully in the 65th minute.
The Argentine aggressor was seen in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Brighton's defensives before he got out in the open space.
Afterwards, Aguero was found surrounded by four green players.
He crossed one defensive, then escaping several others at the edge of Brighton's big region.
Then he gave all to his left, finding Sterling.
Anglo-Word made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton Matthew Ryan's heel, scattering the right side of the nets.
"Awayo faces some problems on his feet," the coach of City, Pep Guardola.
"We said to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the blues the original advantage to the Battle of Premier Ligg.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball deeply into the Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Liroi Sane.
Sane kept the ball in his possession and directed Sterling towards the back beam.
Wormwood of blues kicked the ball in the net just before it went out.
City faces Hafenheim in Champions Lig's clubs on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. on the Ran-Nekar Arena stadium in Sinseim, Germany.
Sergeer wants to beat the Rockys.
As the Niasians were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try yet another start.
But always competing Serzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rocks, but only if there are still consequences for the Rocks in the play-offs, as they precede a game of Los Angeles Dogers at the National Lig West game.
The Rockets have been on the playoffs with their 5-2 victory over the Nasian on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first place in their class.
"Everything we have nothing to gain, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and the other group will probably be a game of the highest level that I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nasian people haven't yet announced who's gonna be the original shooter on Sunday, but they're allegedly tending to let Sergeer drop the ball.
Sergeer, who will make his 34th beginning, did coaching drops on Thursday and will play on Sunday, normally a rest day for him.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his selected candidate for the Bret Cavano Supreme Court, in a speech on the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We are away from five weeks of one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
This is a very important moment, and I am not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am, and that's why I'm traveling everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on saying, "You see this crappy radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to get power back using any necessary means.
They don't care who they're hurting, who must destroy to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give them the money."
The democrats, he said, have taken a "resistance and obstruction."
"And you've seen this in the last four days," he said, describing the democrats as "repeated and bad, wretched and liared."
He was reported to the Senate Judicial Committee by nameing a petition to the senator of the Democratic Democratic Republican Fiinstein, which was accepted with strong public disapproval.
"Remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer.
The Labour Party is no longer a major party.
It is not tolerable to those who express their opinions.
I was not surprised that activists of the Momentum movement in my local group voted to be misled.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Party to whom they have said that they are not welcome, precisely because we think it is.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has had a similar attitude because he has been decisively opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticised because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, indifference, for similar matters to those for which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "We want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation".
Most of the eighteen years since I was a local worker member, the meetings of the General Commission on Friday night were just like this.
Sadly, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'most compassionate, more compassionate' policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started to happen.
It is obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began a little while after Jeremy became chief, as colleagues with whom I thought we had similar political views to start waiting for me to turn 180 degrees and to adopt opinions with which I would never agree, whether they were national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was saying, I was listening to a snout on social media, where some people called for my rejection, denounced the centre's policy and said that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my other colleagues, as the comments that were addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face a miserable sex or racist offense every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how the insults are considered to be normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad case and that with every motion of censure or change of selection rules, the limits of the party are narrowing.
I've been advised a lot in the past two years not to rise up and talk too much and that "Everything's gonna be okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the Thacher government, which literally led to the failure of my entire class, I intended to defend better public services for those who need it, whether as a member of the local council or as government minister.
I have never concealed my policy, and I have done so in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have confused in any way about my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
Those who promoted the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will hit households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to rejection or political feasibility will prevent me from acting as I believe it is in your best interest.

Iir - Melrose: 38 - 17: Invincible Ir climbing to the top
Two late goals may have distorted the result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ir deserved to triumph in this highly recreational Tender Championship today.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only unscrupulous group from ten.
Eventually, it was her higher defense, and the best exploitation of opportunities, which raised the balance in favour of fields and coach Peter Murci had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still being undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ire have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we do."
The goal of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, with the conversion of Frasier Climo, brought Aer forward, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the numbering and Jason Bagot noted a goal without conversion.
Climo increased Iremo's headline with a penalty before scoreing, right in the half year, a goal with conversion, leading Ire to the locker room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half-year-old, and Patrick Anderson's goal, with the conversion of Bagot, reduced the lead to five degrees.
There was a long wait because of a serious injury by Ruarid Not, who was removed by a taxi, and, after the reopening, Ire also increased the difference with a goal of Stafford McDonal, with the conversion of Climo.
Deputy Chief Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of Bruce Colvin's arithmetic advantage with a goal without conversion, after a time of intense pressure.
The fielders came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow tick card on Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored a goal on the back of the attack that Ire.
Clima completed a conversion, as he did almost again since the reopening, after Cali Roue picked David Armstrong's kick and sent Exeter Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the fieldrs.
Stil Game star starts a new focus career
The protagonist of the Stil Game Ford Kiernan series shows ready to go to the restaurant industry after it was discovered that the manager of an licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis's role in popular BBC show, which he writes and which he joined with his partner in Greg Hebfield comic for years.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle would be the last of the show and it appears that Kirnan is planning his life after Gaigland.
According to official records, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited company.
The actress refused to comment on the information, even though the source of Scotish Sun implied that Kiernan wanted to deal with the "big industry" of catering in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": The enclosed Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Navals patrol the fully equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings are wavering blue flags.
At the bases of the lake Titicaka navy to Amazon is the slogan: "Our sea is rightfully owned by us.
It is our duty to get her back."
Throughout the enclosed land of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline occupied by Chile after a bloody conflict to exploit natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have been growing ever since, for decades, as Bolivia has been waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the dynamics, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and it naturally awaits the result with a positive look," Roberto Calzantila said, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the adoption of the International Court of Justice's decision in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivia ruling to require Chile, after decades of unstable talks, to negotiate in Bolivia for the granting of a dominant exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the gifted selfish president of Bolivia, who gives a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has a lot to win or lose since Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to give thousands of territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued only six months after the presentation of the final arguments suggests that the case "it was not complicated," Paz Zarate, a Chilean specialist in international law, said.
And instead of further promoting the Bolivia objectives, the last four years may have undermined them.
"The current Bolivia government has been fetching the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged an ambassador since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velgee, a Bulgarian spokesman in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will gain "a great opportunity to inaugurate a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "close an end to a 139 year's disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzantilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of the most popular leaders of Latin America, uses the issue of leaving to the sea as a political node.
"Bolivia will never renounce her right to access the Pacific Ocean," she added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho states that his state will never disarm his nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
Rei spoke Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises they made during a Singapore summit the leaders of the two states.
Ri made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems ready to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy he had reached a final three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Young Eun.
Ry states that the view that continued sanctions and the US refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point force the North to "stay" is a summer night dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to issue the declaration if Pigning does not first make significant disarmament movements.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism of whether Pigning is seriously thinking of declaring an arsenal which the country considers most likely to be the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pigning next month to prepare a second Kim-Trab summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Discover the latest trends in the oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers presented a series of odd oversized hats to collect Spring-Cary 2019 that stole the show at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Exceptionally uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to Pasarela.
The part that separated from Valentino was an excessive beige hat decorated with a platinum frame can be with wings that totally covered the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories featured watermelons decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewing lips and more referred to Hannibal Lecter than to high rhetoric fashion.
A creation brought in the mind of full diving equipment with respirator and glasses, while another one looked like melted ice cream in a bottle.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you are lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach the main shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Boba", the purple hat with the very wide one we've seen wear so many, from Riana to Emily Ratakovski.
The popular brand created by the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded the social media sent out yet another great creation in the pasarela, a purple beach bag almost as large as the model carrying it in a suit.
The dark orange bag of shelves, decorated with shelves and a white leather grip, was the part that distinguished it from the La Riviera Spring-Karlock 2019 of Jacquemus at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The style of the famous, Luke Armits, said in column FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and large beach bags in shops next summer, as the designer made such a great sense that it would be difficult to ignore demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for people in the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a prehistoric history in academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with still a number of excellent results in the exams, which were merely further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service for their students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare their pupils for the next and higher educational levels, the professional career they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum on request, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable lesson in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language that understands, then what you're saying comes into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, what you say comes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder of the fact that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's examination, it is found that languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in the independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a CVA degree.
Data collected from 74 schools of SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students achieved a discharge A in mandarins, while 72 percent of those studied in German, 69 percent of those studied French and 63 percent of those studied in Spanish also had grade A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as a selection course, are considered equally important to the science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses of the independent schools and elsewhere.
A study of the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that, with regard to the reasons why employers were having trouble covering vacant jobs, a 17 per cent increase in language skills was involved.
The need for language skills is therefore becoming increasingly urgent for young people to be prepared for their future career.
Since more employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that one will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future because of that skill that can best be exploited throughout his life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual individual will have an advantage over competition.
According to YouGov's survey in more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak for a foreign language quite well in order to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentages of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investment in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find jobs with meaning.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose in independent schools, which have qualified teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland provide with a devotion to a learning environment prepared by children and equip them with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future holds for them.
One cannot deny today that in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option, multiculturalism and excellence for young Scotland.
They have to.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland.
Lampron's gonna make his debut in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting for the fans who are reluctant to see Lampron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers reached almost the end of it.
The coach of the Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first game before the racing season against the Denver Nagets in San Diego.
However, it has not been decided yet how many minutes it will be.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trude wrote on Twitter that James probably will play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James asked about his plans on the six- games program that the Lakers had to give before the racing season.
"I don't need preparation racing at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's concentration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of gatherings starting from Wing of West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled concentrations of Trump in the next week, including trips to friendly adjacent areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court to be on hold, Trump seeks to strengthen popular support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Tub's gathering at Wing in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's concentration in West Virginia online below through live flowing to YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to the hearings this week on the candidate for the position at the Supreme Court, Bret Cavano, which took place in a tense atmosphere due to sexual defect claims, with a vote of confirmation of the Senate that has been pending for up to a week while the FBI's investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this group of mergers is to help the Republicans who face a two-faced outcome in the November elections in order to gain some potential.
Thus, President Trump's campaign staff said these five gatherings next week are intended to "mobilise volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of the votes they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so crucial for its agenda, which the president travels to as many states as possible as we drive to the busy period of the campaign," he told Reuters representative of the Trump campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The scheduled for the evening at Wesbanco Arena, Willing, could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News newspaper.
Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state that won with a difference of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Moray, a republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who's down in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morisi that the president should come and try to give him a push to the polls," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the strong will to fight alive holding hopes as it rides to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday's fours in the afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The troubled unfinished momentum is a completely invented sports idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such remembrances.
Where would they say the moment is now?
"First six degrees were precedented, and now it's in front of four, so we probably have a little momentum," Jordan Spith said, leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, to precede four points and to have twelve more to play.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air to their sails" and have much to encourage them, such as the twin Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and everyone took three degrees out of four.
Spith was deadly from the tee to the gren and he gave the example.
The celebrities were made stronger as he continued his round, achieving a critical blow to get the game all-square when he and Thomas were under two.
The hit on the game on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrities showing his conviction that the American team is not out.
"You must look deep in you and worry about your own game," Spithy said.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more grades than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesko Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, the unambiguous story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin of Europe has achieved four out of four, and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit a bogoy on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped the bogoy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which the energy seems to flow towards and from the noisy viewers, seals the fact that they are the players who have to win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun goes above Le Golf National.
Preferably both to different holes at the same time.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
The Baba Watson and Web Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the breakfast fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogoy and two double on the front nine they had the Spaniard and the Swede so deep in a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
On Sunday, though, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and Foursomes are so fascinating struggles to watch them closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has best played as a team so far and has had a significant lead in the last day, but this race between the United States and the United States has also shown that it has the balls, despite the doubts of some.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its headline on the Saturdays and Saturdays with 10-6 compared to the United States.
The inspired twin of the Tommy Flytwood and Francesko Molinari has been dividing two victories against a racing Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead in Le Golf National until now in four grades.
The European side of Thomas Byorne, trying to maintain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the bad American side in the morning fourball with a 3-1 series.
The United States was more resisted at the fansomes, winning two matches, but they were unable to cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points from Sunday 12 single matches to keep the trophy.
Flytwood is the first European newcomer who wins four degrees in the first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
Having been crushed by Woods and Patrick Reid on the powerball, they united their powers to destroy a tired Woods and American newly emerging Bryson De Sabo with an even more emphatic 5-4.
Woods, who was dragged to the two Saturday matches, showed occasional glorious explosions, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in freeball and Foursome and seven in series.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fairball, returned to his partner Henry Stenson for the holidays with 2&1 defeats of the Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppas, conquering the first and third place on the world ranking.
Not all went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three times the winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas put the warp for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory over the John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain to the Fourball and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory Macilroi 4&3 at the topsome while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a team was able to blow up while she missed four degrees in singles, though because he's the trouser, it's enough for Furke to get a tie to keep the trophy.
However, since it was found in the second place for two days, it appears that a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says he won't unilaterally disarm without confidence measures
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen the sense of distrust with the US and that his country will not unilaterally abandon her nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the annual general meeting of the World Organisation that North Korea had received "simultaneous goodwill measures" in the past year, for example, the interruption of nuclear and ballistic tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-supporting nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to start our disarmament unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated known complaints by North Korea about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "street" approach to de-nuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it progressed gradually in the process, its statement was important that it did not completely rule out unilateral de-nuclearisation, as Pigning did in the past.
Rei reported to the public communiqué of Kim Young Eun and Donald Trump at the first summit held between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the "violating Korean peninsula", while Trump promised security guarantees in North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pigning should first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the calls to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The U.S. insist on "first de-nuclearisation" and increase pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve their goal of expelling, putting obstacles even on the "arrest of war", Rei said.
"The notion that sanctions can kneel us is a dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Rei made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which US leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jin in the last five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of de-nuclearisation was South Korea, and not the USA, the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Even so, the tone of Rei's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. Inland with North Korea's ballistic missiles was inevitable because "Caste President" Trump called Kim "Pyroid" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, has dealt with Kim's praise for his courage to proceed with the disarmament measures, but he said that there must be much more and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is deleted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pionyang for the actions taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must be intensified and uninterrupted until complete, final and confirmed demolition is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to neutralise the funding of the Pigning nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pigning again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pionyang in July saying he had made progress in declaring him North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged to a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take 'inverse measures'.
He explained that Kim told him that the "respective measures" he seeks were security guarantees that Trump promised Singapore and promotes normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students follow lessons on how to get a lot of rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all the undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing mass of the whole study with the consumption of much caffeine.
An academic found that students at number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, for example how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, professor of Medical Hypnoea at Harvard Medical School, and specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the lesson, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the lesson after a speech about the effects of depriving sleep in learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I learning about it just now, in my last year?"
He said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he said in The Telegraph newspaper.
The lesson that first began this year explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sport performance, as well as to improving general prosperity.
Paul Baraira, professor of Psychiatrician at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were short of sleep in the week to a significant extent.
The mature course includes a series of interactive work.
In a section there is the image of a student dorm, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of routine sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term deprivation of sleep may increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not directly change student behaviour.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," said Professor Chrisler.
His culture of being proud of studying all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and constant pressure on students means that deprivation of sleep is a problem that is growing.
The enough sleep, good quality, should be the "music" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gains, as deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californianzo studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Chisler draw the lesson, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his class opened up his eyes and inspired him to press for a class all over the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before starting studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Gissler recommended that students regulate an alert for the time they have to go to sleep, as well as an alarming alarm for wakeup time, and that they know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disassemble the guitar rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga has a goal on Jerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad defeat out of the house, as Dolly Menga's spot led the disassembled side of Steven Jerard to defeat with 1-0 in Livingston.
The Improx team sought to mark its first off-site victory from the triumph of February to the 4-1 in Saint-Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games as coach, leaving the eight-degree team behind Harts, which is first in the Ladbrokes Championship ranking.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-year-old and the infamous Rangers roster seemed incapable of returning.
While Rangers is now in the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with just a goal difference from Himperian before.
And Rangers may expect other problems, as supervisor Kalom Spence had to first receive aid for injury to the head caused by an object that was thrown out of the platform.
Jerard made eight changes in team composition and made Aer down the semifinals for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Livi 11", which took a degree of Harts last week and would be happy with how his calibrated machine was able to squeeze every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the occupation, but Livingston did more with the ball.
She should have scored in the second minute, when the first farewell of Menga sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep free shot of Kegan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halckett, but the teammate Alan Lithgou's defensive all he could do was send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelo surely believed that he should have won a penalty in 15', as he crashed with Stephen Loules, but referee Steven Thompson ignored Colombian complaints.
Rangers had only two shots in the area in the first half, but the former improvax, Liam Kelly, didn't worry about Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovian Ejajah's sub-study.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race, Livi was clearly below expectations, nobody can deny that he deserved victory for the effort alone.
Rangers has failed to deal with Jacobs' problem again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hired the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and found Menga who just completed the effort.
Jerard made half-year-old changes to the half-year-old, putting Ryan Kent on and putting on the line, the change handed out almost immediately as he turned the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to lure guests into the style of the game that she knows and enjoys, with Lithgos and Halcketts, to remove one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor managed Jacobs to straighten him out before Lithgou's attempt from the horn.
Rangers' alternate, Glen Medlton, had another phase for a penal to end, as he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson still ignored it.
Almanac: Metter Guigker's Inventor
One of the almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: Like today, 136 years ago and BALE... the day that the future physicist Johann Vilhelm "Hans" Gaiger was born in Germany.
Gaiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation.
A pillar of science has since passed in the sphere of pop culture, such as in the 1950 movie Bells of Coronado, with protagonists of amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Gigker meter, used to detect radioactive mineral elements like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you listen to the action of people who are caused by radiation in the metallic elements."
Evans: "Oh, look, he's acting like a lunatic!"
Hans Gigger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bears its name continues its work.
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune system to see the troubled cells
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune system to see the troubled cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise troubled cells in the context of treatment
The method includes the patient's immune cell export and their modification to the laboratory
They can see a protein that is common to different types of cancer and then re-inject it.
One vaccine under trial has hopeful effects in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the troubled cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the patient's immune cell export, their modification to the laboratory so that they can see a protein common in many cancers called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor J. Berzovski, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzovski explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force to develop several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach to which immunocytes are exported from patients and then "teach" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West was defending the Trump, wearing a hat with the MAGA mark, after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was disappointed in the studio during a Saturnary Night Live after an alternate interview in which he held US President Donald Trump and said he was going to take a candidate in 2020.
After he presented his third song for the night, titled Ghost Town, where he wore a baseball hat with the Slogan Make American Great Again (To make America great again), he gave a resentment of the Democrats and reiterated his support to Trump.
A lot of times I talk to a white man and he says, "How do you like Trump?
If racism were to worry me, I would have left America a long time ago," she said.
The SNL opened up with a sketches in which Matt Damon was leading, with Hollywood's star in order to discuss Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Court regarding the complaints made by Christine Blaze Ford about sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's beam video went up on social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to settle West with this post.
Also, West protested to the public that they were nothaved well in the backgrounds because of his hat.
"They made me bowling in the backgrounds.
They said, "Don't go out with your hat."
They gave me a bowling!
And they say I don't know what happens to me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
I'm gonna wear Superman's cap, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were rejected at least twice by the public, and SNL’s factors seemed to be embarrassed, Variety said, with a person stating in the magazine: "In the entire studio there was a dead rage."
West was summoned as a replacement at the last moment of singer Ariana Grade, whose ex-friend, rapper McMulcher, had died a few days earlier.
West got mixed up enough when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA team, which said: "Towards one of the most courageous spirits: A WHITE ABOUT IN THE WORLD".
However, the show presenter Karen Hunter said that West was just "hisself and that's wonderful".
"But I choose to reward someone (in buying his music or clothes or supporting his "enchant") that I believe embodied and editing ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the thing that was previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Ddi's steps, also known as Puff Dandy, Puffy and P.D.
Rapper Snoop Dog had changed his name to Snoop Lyon and of course the legend of music Before had changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Category of murder attempt to attack a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a knife attack at a man at a East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened at Balihacarmore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the DA.
Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, critics toxic irritability
Kit Harrington is known for the role of swordmaker John Snow in the violent medieval series of HBO's, the Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31, judges the stereotype of a hero, saying that such roles in the screen pass on to the young boys the message that they should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking at The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something goes wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic irritability could be fought in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-start at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having a "strong view" on the subject.
"Personally, now, I think so much, where did we make the mistake with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic irritability because of the male characters it promotes.
Continue: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel like they should display such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people."
He also admitted that he did not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones after the end of the next summer, saying "end the end of battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will be starring at the revival of Sam Shepard's True West project, which relates the history of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that his acquaintance to his wife Rose is the best of the game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in turn, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose put Higgit down, John Snow's lovebird, the character that Kit's playing in, in Emmy's turn.
The couple married in June 2018 to the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in the new cases
China announced 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country more than 820,000 people are affected, according to health services.
Only during the second quarter of 2018 reported about 40,000 new cases.
In their overwhelming majority, the new cases were transmitted by sexual intercourse, signalling a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus was rapidly spreading to some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infected people in this way was almost zeroed, as those responsible for the China health sector said at a conference in Junan province.
However, compared to last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the China LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decentralized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men with sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines in order to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters proclaims the perpetrator leaked data from Republican senator, condemns "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, US Representative Maxine Waters stated that a member of her staff published three Republican senator's Wikipedia pages.
Democratic Member of Los Angeles argued that claims were promoted by commentators and websites on the right side.
"False, lying, and even more terrible lies," Peters said in her Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly comprises the residence addresses and the phone numbers of Senator Lindsay Graham, South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the environment of Capitol Hill during the Senate Committee hearing about allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavano.
The leak took place at some point since the three senators had interrogated Cavano.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with the Waters Office and published the details of a member of staff of Waters, said The Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely inconsistent and blasphemy lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false claims, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely inconsistent and obsolete lies."
Waters' statement quickly criticised the Internet, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Flaisier.
"This confiscation is full of anger," said Flaisler.
"This shows that he does not have the courage to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
It must not be broken.
He must not question the motives of him who blames him.
He must be calm and quiet."
Fleiser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Cavano, who was accused by his critics of appearing very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to depress Water in the middle elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweets.
In her statement, Walters said her office had notified "the competent authorities and the enforcement authorities of these false allegations".
"We will do anything to find those responsible," continued, "and account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for everyone and all my staff."
Review of the film Johny English Remakes - a subtonic spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new movie with British character, and this seems to be true in this revival of franchise movies of action-conspiracy with hero Johnny Inglis, which started in 2003 with the movie Johnny English and came back in 2011 with the movie Johnny English: Return.
Can this humorous self-sacrificing self-sacrificing about how obvious a mess we are to become the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the inconvenient Johnny Inglis with the fury eyes was able to renew his permission to make a second glimpse of them. His name states it's a wider comedy creation designed for non-announced film viewers.
It is of course the arrogant secret agent who pretends to have the shine and ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Klozos, with a dose of "main Bin" and something from the guy who played one single note on the musical theme The Streets of Fire at the ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once experienced in Barclaycard's most forgotten television ads, sowing the chaos through it.
There's one or two nice moments in this JE's last movie.
I liked it when Johnny Inglis approached a helicopter dressed with medieval armor and the props beat his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, humor is quite hypotonic and curious paradox, especially when "severe" film franchise like 007 and Dangerous Mission now includes several comedy elements.
Humour seems to be addressed to children and not to adults and, in my opinion, the crazy instability of Johnny Inglis is not as inventive and relevant as the underwear of Atkinson for the passing of Bin.
The eternal central issue is that the United Kingdom has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has penetrated the super secret Internet spies network of Britain, making the identity of all British agents on a mission, to a great disappointment by the agent to a service that Kevin Eldon is putting in on an unfortunately small role for his velvets.
It is the last drop for a culinary and ambitious prime minister who is on the front of the collapse because of the political compañence: Emma Thompson is doing the best he can with that character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her particularly.
Information advisers inform her that, as any active spy has been revealed, it should bring a decommissioned one back.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who is now working as manager at some aristocratic school, but he gives informal lessons to secret agents: here there are some nice scenes, as Inglis offers a spy academy of type A School of Multi Rock.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for urgent information and reintroduces with Buff's former and passive partner, whom Ben Miller resurrects.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role to which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin of the Gauche for His Majesty's Service are back to action, seeing the beautiful and fatal Benjamin Buletova which Olga Kirilenko is in danger.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being favourably attracted by the gifted billionaire of technology who claims to be able to solve Britain's technological problems: the threatening Jason Volta, which Jake Lacey is at risk.
Inglis and Buffy start the odyssey of their pharmacopolysm: Serviters disguised as waiters, set fire on a lazy French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to get illegally landed in Volta's luxury yacht, and Inglis is causing anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize with Volta's home.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and pesarios, and if it is, it continues to remind a little of children's TV.
Moving things.
And like the other Johnny English films I wonder: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he will really be magnifying with his talent?
Workers find that they look at a plan to work the British four-days, but pay for a half-day
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan to work the British four days a week, but to pay for a five-day job.
The party, according to information, seeks companies' bosses to snuff off the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AE) to workers, giving them an extra free day.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources say the idea is in line with the economic agenda and the party's plans to return the balance to workers.
The change in four-day week-old was approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way of benefiting workers from the changing economy.
Higher source from the Labour Party said in The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a policy change before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one night, but the four-day working week is an ambition that aligns with the party's approach to re-evaluating the economy to the workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to advocate such an idea, as the Green Party promised four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said: 'The fourth working week is not a party policy and is not being examined by the party'.
Shadow government secretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he's determined to regain power from the "official managers" and the "contributors" to the utilities.
The drawings of the shadow government also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not take all their share back, as a potential labour government could carry out 'inmates' due to suspected irregularities.
He also confirmed the plans to place workers at the company boards and to create mutual funds in order to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 UK sterlings.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking about the 60-Minutes show about whether the FBI's investigation into Cavano could change their minds.
The FBI's accusation investigation against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the service could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, correspondent of the 60 Minutes show, asked the Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would make them change.
Kennedy showed up more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes, he's meant," Kennedy said.
"I said that by going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out in the face, and I asked him straight: "Did you do it?"
He was unmovable, determined, emphatic."
However, Graham's vote seems to be not going to change.
"I've decided on Brett Cavanaugh and he'll need some explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
"And whoever has been named can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see anything new to change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citezen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are planned to drag to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Son Men, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event, which is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of struggling actively against it.
In order to ensure free ticket at the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), the interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as saying volunteers, send an email to a world leader, call or find other essential ways to help raise awareness about their objective of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while 12 years are still left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a reward with a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action, or is it just another case of so-called 'cookevilism', that is, when some feel that they really make a difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen’s Global Citizen group has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
It says that these actions helped the world's leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than 37 billion dollars, which are going to affect lives of over 2,25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and communications as a result of these actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been disbursed or gathered.
The group estimates that the funds have so far been directly affected by almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and developers, who are committed "to help children make full use of their potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eradicate malnutrition, having received more than 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Civil Citzens as you, we can make the social injustice of the subjugation a footnote in history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve the feeding of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is aimed at 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In answer to the question "what makes you think that we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequent questions of the website,
a member of the Global Citizen community responded: 'The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all major human rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we unite ourselves more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Sean Men, Cardi B, and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who are going to show up in this year's New York event, which the Deborah-Lie Farnes and Hiw Jackman will present.
The United States may use the Navy for "exclusive" by preventing Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can turn "if necessary" to its Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from being placed on the markets, including the Middle East, as US Home Secretary Ryan Zink revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where he is attempting at a call from the legal government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons for which they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in eastern and southern Europe," he said, according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means of responding to Russian activity.
"The United States is able, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendants in the context of a event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit-making group that is characterised by the 'energy consumer voice' in the United States.
He took stock of Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, in a little bit, the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, referring to Russia, with the term "ponority that knows only one trick", as it has an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as the Trump administration has undertaken to strengthen exports of the American LPG in Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a "floor" of Moscow.
Moscow has pointed out repeatedly that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of USD 11 billion, which is going to double the existing pipeline capacity in 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's firm resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude caused Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
The leading organization of Germany for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third State interferes with our energy supply," Dmiter Kebf said, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider declaring candidateship for the Presidency in 2020, declared Massachusetts' senator
The senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday he would seriously consider declaring candidates for the presidency after the interim elections.
At a meeting at the City Hall of Cholouk Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our troubled government, and that's why a woman on the top is needed," said The Hill.
After November 6, I will examine the possibility of a candidate for the Presidency.
Warren criticised President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he's driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump does in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't chew her words about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "naturally and necessary an FBI investigation prior to the vote".
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think they should be running for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "possible" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not be no candidate, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% was in favour of such a candidate.
The poll highlighted more support for a possible candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% being in favour of a possible candidacy and 48%.
Other popular names from the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible candidacy for 2020 are former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he'd have officially decided by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Track Pailin's Post-traumatic Stress at the Donald Trump gathering.
Trak Pailin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruiting in September.
Arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night
"With what goes on since my son has returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Post-Maastral Stress and the injuries carried by our soldiers when they return home," he told the public in the context of a gathering on Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "return a little different, returning harder, reckoning if there is respect for what the soldiers, the airlocks and every other member of the army have done."
Arrested on Monday in Washila, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, intervention in reference to domestic violence and armor while being intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, representative of the Wales Police Department.
18 states and the Cologne region support the question of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the region of Columbia support a legal challenge for the new US policy that refuses asylum to the victims who are trying to escape from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the region submitted a reference amicus curiae on Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to challenge politics, NBC News said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Session lodged by the American Civil Liberties Association in August against Federal Policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her, however, US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
The states' lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries that have severely affected gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed the 2014 decision adopted by the Immigration Committee (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants who are out of situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia Regional Prosecutor Karl Rasin said Friday that the new policy "gos for whole decades of state, federal and international law".
"According to federal law, all asylum claims under the special circumstances and circumstances of the request must be examined; such a coma infringes this principle," when reporting amicus curiae.
The lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy that refuses entry into immigrants damages the US economy, suggesting that it is more likely to become businessmen and be "a necessary workforce".
In June, Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in immigration to no longer grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from situations of domestic violence and gangling.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political view," Session said in his announcement of June 11 regarding politics.
The aim of the asylum was never to relieve all problems (even more serious) faced by people daily around the world.
Recognized rescue efforts in Palos, as the number of dead doubles by the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was constantly worsening.
"It's very intense," said Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby who had fever at a evacuation center that was stationed in the ruined city of Palos.
"Every minute the ambulances bring more bodies.
The clean water is spinning."
Some residents attempted to return to their damaged homes and collect their presents through the water, trying to salvage what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-spectrum earthquake were unable to meet the needs.
Some injured, such as Dwy Harris, who suffered a fracture of the middle and shoulder, were left out of the Army Hospital of Pale where the first aid was given to the countryside because of the continuing strong divisions.
The tears flooded his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake to shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the debris of the wall," said Harris at Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "acquisition" with "progressive ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertising in a daily US newspaper venting the mutual commercial benefits between US and China, US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to break up his propaganda.
US President Donald Trump reported last Wednesday on the payroll of China Daily that appeared in Des Moines Recorder, the most sales newspaper in the state of Iowa, who accused China of seeking to be involved in the Congress elections on November 6, a charge that China refused.
The Trump category of Beijing attempted to get involved in the US elections marked what US officials reported to Reuters that it was a new phase in the escalating campaign that Washington launched to push China.
Although it is not forbidden for foreign governments to publish advertisements for the promotion of their trade, Beijing and Washington at the moment are involved in a scaling trade war and have imposed mutually different import tariffs.
China's tariff opposition to the commercial wars was aimed at hurting exporters in states like Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, reported Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brandt, US Ambassador to China and former governor with a long term mandate in Iowa, a state that is an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had affected workers, farmers and businesses in America.
China, as Brastad wrote in an opinion article on Sunday Des Moines Register, "provides in this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda advertising in our free press".
"In an attempt to disperse this propaganda, the government of China exploits the precious tradition of freedom of speech and free press in America, publishing for the money ad in Des Moines Recorder," Brandt wrote.
"Of the contrary, in the context of Beijing, you will find very few different voices and no true representation of the different views the Chinese people may have on the problematic economic path of China, given that SMEs are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has escaped the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal who.
Republiks alienate female voters in the context of the mid-term elections with Cavano, warns the analysts
As many leading Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Bret Cavano Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women in the next interim elections.
Feelings on this issue are very tense and most Republicans have said that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be restored," said in The Hill Grant Rier, professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, as regards an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the last minute move of Senator Jeff Fleek (R-Azona) asking for an investigation by the FBI would be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will definitely not forget it in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive MoveOn team, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters cried out the slogan "November comes!" in the Senate hall as the Republicans who control the judiciary gave the green light for the candidacy of Cavana, despite Dr Christine Buzzi Ford's testimony, said Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," said Story Rodeberg, an independent political analyst, on the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old who, while opposing the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement in which he described her allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts predicted that there could be a reaction if the Republicans proceeded with the anointing.
"This is a huge chaos for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the vote on the committee or on the final vote, or whether Kavano will be out of the question. It is about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they were brought to it," Gai Sesil, director of the Priorities USA Group, who was in charge of the election of the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the statements of Fortn and Cavanos, while slightly more so than the second one.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford's statement, while 35% said that they certainly or probably believed Cavanos.
In addition, 38% said that he believed Cavano probably or certainly lied to his statement, while just 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Fleek's move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford's complaints and at least one more complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Last week, Ford filed on oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Cavanaugh attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her genitals while they were at a party when they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Heritage Inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the World Heritage Inventor, starts a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new potion of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee's open platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data can be stored, and who can have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is the "global sovereignty".
"We have to do it now," he said about startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage space" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, pending lists, calendar, library music, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify being all available on a browser and all of this at the same time.
The unique feature of the data storage staff is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal reinforcement through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to company’s CEO, John Bruce, is that the company should offer resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some co-symbolised programmers who worked in the project and a community of code volunteers.
Since this week technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said he and his team don't talk to " Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overthrowing business models in one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a media post released on Saturday, Bernerce Li wrote that "the Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when World Wide Web Consortium was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In the past few months, Berners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berner Li will remain the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for the next era of the Internet," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: Price to clergyman who received Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clerk of the English church who has received the Viktoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had seconded the highest British military distinction.
Saturday was the revealing of a commemorative plaque by his two grandsons, accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was a "absolute symbolic" that the board revealing was made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which the medal was taken.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the opposition van led his order to the Sun-Kenten Canal by means of a very dense fog and strong fires by weapons of battle and machine guns."
Later, he rushed into the front line and with "excellent manhood" led the line forward before he hits himself with a battle weapon three from the passage.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said his grandpa's heroic deeds were "something I know I could never reach, is something that makes you feel unlimited."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wreath after the parade led by the charming new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said "was a great honor to participate in the parade" and added that "the maleity of a genuine hero is proven by the support it has of many people".
MMA fans were late to attend the Bellor 206, but they saw Peppa the Purunky
Think of the following scenario: you have stayed up to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but they deprive you of the pleasure of seeing this unique sport event.
The project in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on main card, and would live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Musassie and Rory McDonald were about to go out to the ring, the viewers in the United Kingdom were remarried when the show changed to Peppa the Purunky.
Some were not happy at all, as they had been awakened until the early hours especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described the promotion of the child's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so the child program was to be projected," said Dave Svards, senior vice-president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Pope Purunky, too."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were going to work out the program to include the UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the ripples, I think we can do it," Koker said.
"But there's six Sunday morning there, and we won't be able to do it until Sunday time, that is theirs Monday.
But we're trying to do it.
Believe me, when the change occurred, many messages were exchanged back and not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't because of the rules.
I promise you that next time this is not going to happen.
We'll limit it to the five games instead of six, as we usually do.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olympians in diving, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling less than the rest because of his sexuality, however, this pushed him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until high school that not everyone is like me.
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern in Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give the other hope.
He also said that since he became a parent, he is less interested in a victory in the Olympic Games.
Kirstie Yang, a regular broadcaster, was for several months on a disease leave.
As invited to Laverne's first show, Daly said he felt "insufferable" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He said, "After today, these feelings of lowerness and differentness have given me the strength and will to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze Olympiacos is an occasional defender of the rights of LGBTKI community and took advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to move forward in the demolition of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, with no impact, and that he wanted to give other hope.
The three times world champion said it was a surprise when he fell in love with a man, American filmer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years older, but he claimed that the age difference was never the subject.
"When you spend so much in such a young age" (he was the first time in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it is hard to find a conspiracy with similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said his perspective had changed.
"If you were asking me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer in the brain.
Daly said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had booked for the 2012 London Olympics, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you won't be around us to sit in the front row," he said.
"I kept his hand while he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly fought at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life, fighting diving in the Olympic Games in my homeland, there was no better emotion," he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which inclined him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes him creeps.
The Desert Island Discs transmits to BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-date Micelson will sit on the counter Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Philadelson will mark a record Sunday when he plays his 47rd race at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time (registration number) in the matches organised every two years, was forced by leader Jim Furick to sit on the field for the Fourball and Foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it tends to be for the United States, the five-time winner won the day to inspire from the lines and "work" his game in hopes that he will correct his problem.
Without ever having been the smartest drive even on the abscess of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for Le Golf National, where faraways are often problematic.
And as if the field was not over, Mikelson, in Sunday's ninth race, faces Franchesko Molinari, champion of British Open, who works with the first-phase Tommy Flytwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mikelson's game can be critical.
Furick expressed his trust in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understands the role he plays today, hit me in the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Funk said.
"He has great confidence.
His name is at the Hall of Fame and he has offered a lot to these teams, both in the past and this week.
I guess I hadn't figured him play two games.
I was thinking more, but there we ended up and we thought we should go.
He wants to get out there like everyone else."
Mickelson's going to get over Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday games on Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career at Ryder Cup that did not reach the height of his individual record.
Micelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half, although Furik said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make plates and he's excellent in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players were also having fun in junking this week, and it was funny to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The leader of the European group, Thomas Burne, is aware that the great lead may be lost soon
Thomas Byrne, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great lead that starts from the singles of the last day at Ryder Cup can easily be converted into defeat.
Danus made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama race, where a team with leader of Sheve Balestros managed to get advantage of five degrees against the Americans, but he just managed to cross the final line with a breast difference, winning 141⁄1⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," Burn said, in the picture, after attending the generation of 2018, to win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that this is not over.
We're on our way tomorrow to give it all.
We'll go out there and play right.
Nothing's over until you see the grades in the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that in the other group there are equally good players – the best in the world".
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Byorne adds: "I wouldn't rush to prejudicate the result.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow, atomic performance counts, and that's something else.
It's wonderful to be on the field with a clutch when things work out well, but when you're out there alone, then you're testing your skills to the top of your golf.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, how to get their best self-absorbed tomorrow.
You leave your partner behind, and he has to give it all and show his best self."
Contrary to Biorne, Jim Furrick from the opposing team will ask his players to perform better atomic performance than they had with their team partners, except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three points of the four.
Furrick himself has experienced both ends of the changeovers of the last day, as it belonged to the winning team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every rhetoric of his word," he answered when he asked how Ben Krenshasso, the leader of 1999, had assembled his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get this momentum, there is a great deal of pressure in the middle races.
We decide our turn accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we will try to make our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has undertaken to lead the race and face Rory McKilroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it covers all the way," said Biorne, justifying his singles choices.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The new freshness of the German Navy should have been put on service in 2014 to replace the ageed warships of the Cold War season, but will not be taken until the next year at least because of defective systems and spent costs, they report local means.
The position of the freshman Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand newly-freshed class Baden-Wuertemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which invokes a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the issues with tradition have been decisive for the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of Baden-Wuertemberg class that he ordered the Navy in 2007 will replace older Bremen freshmen.
They will bring strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as new freshmans can be used for up to two years outside the German ports.
However, the constant delays mean that, although the warships are considered to be the latest technology, they will allow Germany to show its foreign power until they finally enter service, they will be outdated, notes Die Zeit.
Poor freshness F125 became a headline last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
There have not been many information known about the reasons for the return, but German media has mentioned a number of important "defects with software and material" that the war ship would have had if used on a battle mission.
Software’s problems were particularly important since Baden-Wuertemberg ships have a crew of about 120 seamen, just half as compared to old Bremen freshmen.
It was also discovered that the ship has a much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The fresh Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tonnes is believed to have twice as much weight as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost for the whole project (including crew training) has also been a subject.
It is said to have reached the gloomy sum of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), while the initial budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of new infrequents are particularly important as Germany's naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defensive committee, admitted that the Hellenic Navy "only will have no ships for missions".
The official said that the problem was squeezed over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg freshmen could join the Navy.
National Trust hears the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a property in Highlands Scotland seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when they're after their food.
The findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to plan future environmental protection actions.
The study by National Trust scientists for Scotland will explore the habits of the common night night night and petty nightclub, as well as Dobendon's brown bay and the Dobendon's pet in the gardens Invere Gardens, at Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the farm to monitor night activities throughout the season.
The NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings by experts will verify the frequency of bats' calls and which species have this behaviour.
A map of the site will then be created and a report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Duar, NTS protection counselor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of management of biotopes, such as the creation of grasslands and the best way to keep the forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the whole United Kingdom have decreased considerably since the last century.
They are threatened by the construction work and development projects affecting the parts where they are tiring and destroying their habitats.
Winners and lighting are also a risk, as are the conspicuous flies and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by household cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced sound-centred technique to detect insects and obstacles to the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers the bats very important.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspect the parts where bats are bored and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created the first and unique shelter of Scotland only for bats on the Threave estate, in Dampris and Gallory, where eight of the ten kinds of bats of Scotland live.
The property manager, David Thompson, states the land is the ideal ground for bats.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent bat area," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many large trees and an ideal habitat.
There's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to increase their populations."
Points out that it is important first to check nights before any maintenance work in housing, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and young people, possibly eliminate the whole local population.
Bats are protected species and are prohibited from killing them, harassing or disturbing their peace, or destroying their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrel, executive of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said, "We expect a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species simply do not know about the development of their population."
Ronalto refuses complaints to rape, as his lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronalto described the complaints of rape against him as "fake news," saying some "want to be self-provoked" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The aggressive of the National Portugal and Yuvendus is accused of raped by an American, called Catherine Majorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the complaint, she allegedly paid $3750,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking of a live video in Instagram to 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronalto, 33, described "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fetch news," said five times the Golden Ball winner on the camera.
"They want to be mourned and exploited my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and it's all right," the player added smiling.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations published, which they termed as "inadmissible rumors that touch private life", according to Reuters.
Justice Skerch's attorney said that the player will demand compensation for "ethical damage to an equivalent level of the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After their acquaintance to a nightclub, Ronalto and Maryorga returned to the player's room, where she was alleged to be raped against nature according to documents lodged at Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Magorga claims that Ronalto fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was by "99 percent" a "good guy", but he betrayed the other "one percent".
The papers suggest that Ronalto admits that they had sexual contact, but that it was consensual.
Magorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed on an extrajudicial settlement, because she was “abhorred of opposing” and concerned about her "public demise".
34-year-old says he's trying to overthrow the settlement, as he continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome because of the alleged incident.
Ronalto was on the forefront of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Union at the time of alleged abuse and this summer moved to Italy Yuvedus ensuring an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret the loss of automotive industries
The United Kingdom "will regret forever," if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the car industry after Brexit, said Operations Minister Greg Clark.
She added that it was "wrong" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain leave the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car industry stated that the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where the models of Auris and Avensis, Toyota, built, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leave the EU at the end of March, production will be interrupted," said Marvin Cook, Toyota CEO, Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has declared the closure of Mini's plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to risks to the supply chain according to the automotive industries in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The production line of Toyota follows the just-in-time. The spare parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers to both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a lack of equipment according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock beyond one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark stated that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically attempting to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible deal that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," BBC Radio's Today show said 4.
"The elements coming not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that the continuity of supply chains must necessarily be ensured."
Toyota was unable to say how much carpet would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional cost would lower the factory’s competitiveness and would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the Union's trade union leader at the factory, said the members of the association are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never come back again.
Government spokesperson said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, announces the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "cleared another week", as the controversy for the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special investigator Robert Muller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, Trump's assistant links with Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump fires the Deputy Prosecutor General, endangering Muller's independence, powers Washington's gossips for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record his talks with Trump and allow the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
However, last Monday he moved to the White House on reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations Organization in New York.
Trump said he would "did" not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary Affairs in which Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week on the claims against Cavano, thus delaying the holding of a vote from the Senate's plenary.
Sarah Sanders, Tub's press spokesperson, appeared on Fox News Sunday TV show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It hasn't yet been a date, it may be this week, but it may be another week, given all the other cases that concern the supreme court.
But we'll see, after all, I like to always inform the guy."
Some journalists opposed this allegation: Sanders has made press briefing at the White House since 10 September.
You know, this guy, Chris Wallace, asked why this was happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of updates was not due to despair against the "information" movements of television journalists, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being displayed."
Then let it be understood that it will increase or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without saying: "We looked at them."
They will continue to have updates, Sanders said, but 'if the press is able to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is better than talking to me.
We try to apply it often and see that we have often applied it in recent weeks and take the position of press briefing where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often asks questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press interviews with official visitors.
Isolated type interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably proved because this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes odd appearance before concentrated journalists.
The Health Minister sends a letter to EU citizens working at the Scottish National Health System via Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to EU citizens employed in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to stay after the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Jin Friman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter with less than six months left to leave the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of permanent resident status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Friman wrote in her letter: 'The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued in the autumn and were leading to anticipated decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario of not reaching an agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each official of nationalities.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Cristion Abercrobi undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrobis defensive was subjected to emergency surgery following a surge in the sabbath struggle, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by newspaper journalist Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reid's main coach told journalists that the injury occurred just before the half-year.
"He came to the counter and just collapsed there," Reid said.
Teachers and medical staff gave Abercrobi oxygen to the bench, and then they put him in a truck and carried him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State officer told Chris Harris of the WSMV TV station in Tennessee Nassville that Ambercroby was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no "no evidence of the type/extension of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, second-year student under confined participation ('redshirt'), travels his first season to Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He did five total ticks on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching 18 total ticks for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher paper fee for the acquisition of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher paper fee for the acquisition of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tories projects.
The measure will counteract the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the bill fee will be imposed on any buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance anticipates that it will collect up to £ 120 million per year - for help with the bourgeois
Foreign buyers will start to charge a higher paper fee for the acquisition of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will be used to help the bourgeois people, as Teresa May will now announce.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises of more economic housing and to aim for high pay.
The increase in the bank fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons not taxed in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
The increase, imposed at the current bank charge, together with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the second placement and renting of dwellings, can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will bring up to £ 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new real estate in London is purchased by persons not resident in the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and making it more difficult to enter first-loss buyers into the property market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become 'growth-phrases' due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the bank fee so that more young people can obtain their first place of residence.
He accused the large construction companies of holding the prices of high-quality real estates, gaining land without, however, using and inviting Ms. May to abolish the walls in economic housing to restore Britain's "standard power".
Mr Corbin has announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, which include rent controls and a ban on 'seasonity' evacuation.
He also wishes to give more power to councils to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: "I said last year that I would dedicate my prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - to the improvement of life for every new generation.
And that means repairing the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be appropriate for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies operating abroad to buy homes as easily as hard workers British nationals.
For too many people the dream of housing ownership has become very far and the intimacy of homelessness remains exist."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train Scottish team"
Sanderland's leader, Jack Ross, states that "his absolute ambition" is to become sometime coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enthusiastic with the challenge of re-establishing the team of North-East England, which is currently in the third place in the category of football in England (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, after giving St. Miren back to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team and that was," said Ross at the Scottish BBC on Sportsound radio.
"But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Hubden all the time with my dad as a child, and that's something he's always pulling me back.
But this opportunity will come only if I have a success in the training of teams."
Among Ross predecessors in Sanderland is Dick Andvokat, David Moyes, Sam Alardyes, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paolo D.C.
Aloa Ateletic’s former coach says he didn’t feel awe when he was called to be so well-established names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
"Now the success for me will be measured by the answer to the question "Can I bring this team back to Premier Ligg?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this group, it is undoubtedly owned by Premier Ligg," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross started his career as coach just three years ago, having spent a period of time as the assistant coach in Dabarton and a 15-month period in Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa return from the subjugation to the third category and led St. Miren to the lip of the subjugation to the conquering of the Championship next season.
Also, Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartgul, Folkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," said reminding the coach of Aloa's post.
"I really thought it suited me more to be coach than a player.
Sounds weird because I was doing well, I was making a decent money out of it, and I'd gotten pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with stress and stress at work, but my coach's work fits perfectly.
I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt with myself in my adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5:30 pm on Saturdays, according to research
The summer heater boosted the winnings for Britain's tested pubs but brought more pressure to restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars increased sales by 2,7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4,8 per cent, as the numbers revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultancy company, which gathered the data, said: "The continuous sunshine and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with the previous month, in June, when pub profits increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered even greater blows.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant revenue in June simply deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars that serve alcohol have gone a long way better, with the corresponding elements of previous years being more up than the corresponding restaurants fell.
The food - serving pubs also suffered in the sunny days, although not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
In all manipulative pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM-recreational and hospitality analyst, said: "These results verify the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sport events remain the biggest sales factors in the off-shore market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, but the drop in sales by 4.8 per cent annually will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have occurred at a worse time for the businessmen in the catering area and the time will indicate whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a much-needed extension."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade names.
The sales index of Coffer Peach Tracker for the United Kingdom pub, bar and restaurant collects and analyses profitability data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over £9 million and is the established benchmark for the industry.
One in five children keep secret accounts on social media hidden from their parents
As the survey reveals, one in five children - even 11 years old - keeps secret accounts in social media hidden from their parents and teachers
Research at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake pages ("fake Instam")
This news stimulated the fears that sexual content is being erected.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "mother" account to show their parents
One in five children - even 11 years old - creates social media accounts that keep hidden from adults.
An investigation at 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake "fake Insta" accounts - this is a reference to the Instagram photo notification website.
This report stimulated the fears that sexual content is being erected.
The twenty percent of students said they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents, while they keep private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter spotted a teenager who urged others to rape her ("violate me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awarness UK and the HMC in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to maintaining hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "They are alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot identify them."
Eileyd Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the Scottish Board of verses.
Eileyd Doyle was elected as a non-executive consultant to the Scottish Board at the annual general meeting of the management body.
Doyle is the most devastated Scottish spectator and President Ian Bitti commented on her election as a great opportunity for those running the sport to take advantage of her broad international experience in the past decade.
"Elind enjoys infinite respect throughout the Scottish, British and global verse community and we are confident that the Scriptures in Scotland will benefit from its entry into the Council," Biti said.
Doyle said, "I am excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and assist in the guidance of the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in Atlanta Olympics in 1996, had won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator at BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "Before a month I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether I'm going to recover.
It was a disgraceful, but I was completely recovered, and I learned again to walk and today I'm doing vulnerability exercises!
Thanks for encouraging messages!"
Advertising a nipple that compares mothers with cows
A suckler production company has dictated online public opinion with an advertising that compares mothers who suck at cows who milk them.
In order to lighten the so-called 'worldly first quiet and worn feather', the Elvie consumer technology company released a homogeneous advertising inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom that it offers to the nursing mothers the new caretaker.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of sand, with a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't daisies, they're my boobs."
The choir goes on, "Look it up, blonde it, feed it, blonde it, blonde it, I'll milk my ladies."
However, advertising, published on the Facebook page of the company, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the spectators, as many say it doesn't take the milk industry seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth” someone commented.
Elvie’s nursery fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Substantially injured both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended the advertising, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "hearted".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy a feather like that if I still would.
Awfulness made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I didn't get to overthrow it.
It's a smart product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny advertising aimed at moms who draw breast milk (frequently in their workplace or in the toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not advertising that praises or criticisms the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all danced with the discreet dolls buried in their brass.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who draw breast milk are saying that they feel like cows.
Elvie nursing, however, is completely silent, does not have cables or tubes and fits discreetly into a mammalian bracelet, allowing women to move, keep their babies and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive director of Creation at Mother, commented: "The Elvie taller is such a revolutionary product that deserved him a bold and challenging flake.
By making a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to put at the heart of raising mother milk and all the challenges it possesses, showing at the same time a fun and relevant way the incredible sense of freedom that the new caretaker will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's feud becomes a headline.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the pasarela for the fashion designer Marta Yakobovski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved quietly into a camp at the Texas border
The number of in custody immigrant children has reached heights, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to match children with maintainers.
Traditionally, most maintainers are themselves immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to come forward and ask for a child and thus put their own chance of staying in the country at risk.
The risk was intensified in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential maintainers and other adult members of their household would have to issue fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the service had captured dozens of people who were asked to maintain unaccompanied minors.
Later the service confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had a white criminal record.
"More than 80 per cent of people who are either maintainers or members of the household of the dependants are illegally in the country and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Albens.
The aim of the quickest treatment of children's affairs was to introduce new rules whereby any of these children should appear before a court within a month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously applied, according to workers in shelters.
Many will appear by means of a videoconferencing, in the place of self-personal appearance, in order to develop their allegations of granting legal status before the judge responsible for immigration matters.
Those who consider that they do not fulfil the conditions for exemption will be expelled immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be nervous or distressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the workers in shelters and with reports from the system in recent months.
Counsel said these concerns are intensified to larger installations such as Turnilo, where indications that a child is more difficult to understand because of the size of the facilities.
They added that the movement of children into the camp without being given sufficient time to prepare children psychologically or say goodbye to their friends may worsen the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria invites American, French and Turkish "containers" to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walind al Mullem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mullem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will receive proper treatment."
"It must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the convention.
Mullem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been threw apart from homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "given this sacred battle until we kick all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who mainly train and inform both the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground of the warfare.
On the issue of refugees, Mullem said that conditions are good for their return and accused "certain Western countries" of "screwing of absurd fears" that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicising an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a destructive zone in the last major revolutionaries in Indlib created the opportunity to promote political discussions.
The Russian agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russia-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moulem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "sample deadlines", and hoped that military actions would target jihaddists, including those associated with Al-Qaeda Front Nousra, who "will be neutralized".
UN special envoy Stafa de Mistoura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Mullem laid the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to 'the revision of the articles of the current constitution' and warned that there should be no intervention.
Why Trump will win a second term
In that sense, Mr Trump will again win the 2020 elections, unless, as most liberal viewers hope, the motion of censure and scandals will soon end its presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending final of all time!"
So far there are no signs of the spectators' fatigue.
As of 2014, the TV numbers in the high-television area have been more than doubled by reaching 1,05 million in CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2,4 million viewers in the high-screen TV area, while four years ago it had 1,7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC show show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned the TV television numbers with 3.5 million viewers in the evenings of important news.
It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neil Bauer said, producer of the dramatic ABC series "Designed Survivor" (Publications of Next Day) where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Skovel, veteran comic series veteran and book author "Just the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
Reminds of a taxi route in Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her driver said he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
She said, "Why?"
"He answered because she makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovel said.
You can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, the scenarios that come out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v Wade case, if migrant families can re-enact the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of an informed citizen for six hours when you're watching a team of experts discussing the use of "very long interviews in the background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear" ("Food"), the bomber jacket of Paul Manafort with skin of ostrich worth 15,000 dollars ("a cloth full of water", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the glazing descriptions made by Stormi Daniels about the anatomy of Mr. Tramb.
I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What gives you a sense of the love show is that it gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the TV program "Pawn Stars", about the ever-changing actors and daily overturns in the plot of Trump's work (nark fights with NFL, praises Kim Young Eun).
You can't afford to lose any episode, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the northern coast of Cawai, but he was closed in watching MSNBC while filming the CNN.
He could not break it off, not when Bret Cavano was going to attend the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
"This will mean the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Flais.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

External money enters the most marginal amortization for mid-term elections
It is no surprise that the 17th region of Pennsylvania in Congress receives a flow of money thanks to the re-election of Congress' constituency, which set two current members of the Congress for the same position.
This newly-designed Pitchburg region is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another region in special elections last spring.
Lamp has another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the former 12th elections in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which held in January that the old regions were manipulative for the benefit of the Republicans.
The election campaign in the new 17th district sparked a financing competition campaign between the largest financial parts of the parties, the Democratic Campaign for Congress (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamp became popular in Pennsylvania since he achieved a marginal victory in a special election campaign held in March, for the 18th elections in Pennsylvania in Congress, which watched a lot of people.
This position was taken by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 degrees.
Political analysts give a slight lead to the Democrats.
The United States has examined the possibility of punishing El Salvador for his support to China, but they have backed it.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Xuan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and kept a hotel in Panama until the partners had suspended the administrative team of the Trump Agency.
State Department officials decided to revoke the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "precarious decision-making not to recognize Tajvan anymore," as Heather Nawert said earlier this month, the service spokesman.
However, the sanctions against El Salvador were only examined, which is estimated to receive about USD 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country, with high levels of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings evolved, the officials of North and Central America postponed a high-tech conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, as a follow-up to a conference held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the transition of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior management made it clear that they wanted to go ahead with the conference, actually putting an end to the allegations of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Penns is going to address the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October, in terms of the great importance of the management concentration, as the diplomats have said.
All three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, on the condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst located near the administration, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow can be the report of Special Advisor Robert Muller on the impediment of justice by Mr Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is said that Mr Muller also turns his investigation into the possibility of co-existence between Mr Trump's electoral campaign and Russia with regard to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr Trump will be held accountable before that body, as he is preparing to reclaim the presidency in the next elections and perhaps before a vacant court.
The 'if' is a lot and I do not suggest that the fall of Mr Trump or his bonds in Europe is inevitable.
There are options that all of us will have to make on both sides of the Atlantic to judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported the Czechslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The boundary of history revolves around such turning points and the irresponsible course of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now confronted with several of these turning points.
What do we do if Mr Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rozin, the man who holds the fate of Mr Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he was written in that newspaper that last year he suggested that the president should be recorded in secret and that he was considered inappropriate to the president’s position.
Mr Rosenstein said that the version adopted by Times is inaccurate.
"How will we answer if the recently requested investigation by F.B.I. for Brett Cavano is not full or fair or is he appointed to the Supreme Court despite the well-founded charges for sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections on a Congress that will put Mr Trump in charge?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in the matter, I think we won't fail.
My mother was Czechoslovakia Jewish who was transferred to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Embassy residence.

Graham Dorens of Rangers is optimistic for the battle with Rapid Vienna
Ranger welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain with Viyarell earlier this month, will give her a lot of chances of qualification from the 7th Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorens from making his first appearance in the season to the drawout with score 2-2 with Viyarell, but he thinks that Rangers might use this result as a stunt for bigger successes.
"It was a good time for us because Viyarell is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We walked into the game thinking we could achieve something and came out with a certain degree.
Perhaps we could get away at the end, but in general, the drawback was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were a better team in the second half.
Now Thursday is another big European night.
Well, we can take three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have brought a good result in their last game, but, with the world on the platform, I'm sure we can put our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and the changes that were made to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, training is good.
Let's hope that we can do our best now, leave our past season behind and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of pension saving
Although the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to take care, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken about this matter in their children.
"The people want their family to take care of them, but they don't take an initiative to have this debate," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Operation.
Start with this.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not express your desires much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care as these options may be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial counselor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term options can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance at a buy price to help you meet these costs or automation with your own property - just as long as you have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a proxy on healthcare to define a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, consider the possibility of making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your part and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you become helpless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Please indicate these details in a written draft to be ready.
"It's not just the economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin wondered.

Men received multiple fires with a gun in Ilfracomp.
A man took multiple fires with an air gun while walking towards his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years of age, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracomb, Devon County, when he took shots in the chest, belly and hand.
Police have described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Daytime, as a "hard event".
The victim didn't see the attack shooter.
The wounds he suffered are not threatening his life, and the police are appealing for witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pali on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the communications to be interrupted, humanitarian forces have not been able to obtain information from Dongala, an area in the north of Palos, which is closer to the center of the 7.5 degree earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Pales more than 16,000 people were removed after the outbreak of the catastrophe.
Here are some important data on Palau and Dongala on Sulawi Island:
Palos is the capital of the province of central Sulawi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawazi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is an antique stretching more than 300 km (180 km) coastline in the southwest of the island of Sulawazi.
Resistance, a step by administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main supports of the province's economy in Sulawazi, and in particular in the seaside region of Donegal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is found more in Morouli on the coast of Sulawazi.
Paul and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the last 100 years, according to Indonesian Destroying Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit Western Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most recent earthquakes and tsunami are the following:
2004: A great earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226.000 people along the Indian Ocean coast while over half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead in the island, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-point earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree earthquake of the Richter scale centred close to Pandang city, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,200 people were killed.
2010: Richter scale earthquake hit one of the Medawi islands, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis of 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost life in about 300 people.
2016: Low focal depth earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya area in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it brought to the world memories of the destruction caused by the murderous earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the buildings they fell.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former commander of Alaska and candidate for Sarah Palin's vice president, was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin, from Wazila, Alaska, was arrested as suspect of domestic violence, obstruction of a complaint about domestic violence and resistance to the principle, according to the report published by the police on Saturday (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the crimes she allegedly committed, she grabbed her phone from her hands.
Pailin is temporarily detained at Mat-Su temporary storage store, with a $500 guarantee, as mentioned at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared "single, innocent" when asked, as the network says.
Palin faces charges for three categories A, which means that he can be subjected to a prison sentence of up to one year and a penalty of $250,000.
It is also accused of a category A flood, punished by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminals have been prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 charges were imposed on domestic violence, blocking a complaint about the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His partner claimed that he blinked her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans' teams in 2016 when he linked the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit by Sulawi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 degrees-sized earthquake of the Richter scale caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit near the central Sulawi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media circulate videos from the time of the catastrophic event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palos when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors are asking for the rarely-indicated death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in New York.
The Federal Prosecutors in New York are asking for a death sentence to Shiflo Saidov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, who cost life in eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saidoph, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental truck in the company Home Depot to attack a bicycle along the West Side Avenue in Kato Manhattan, drifting pedestrians and bicycles found on its way on October 31.
In order to justify the sentence to death, the prosecutors should prove that Saidov killed the eight victims of "intent" and caused severe physical damage "intent", according to the statement of intention of the death penalty, which was lodged in the Southern Court of New York.
Both of these charges drag the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal juror body brought Saipov against the charges of 22 category, which included eight charges for homicide pro-critical organization, a tactic that often applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a charge for the exercise of violence and destruction of automotive vehicles.
The attack called for "significant design and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saidov attacked the attack as a "patient, cruel and indebted."
"Sifulo Habibulajevic Saipov caused pain, damage and loss in the families and friends of Diego Angelini, Nicholas Clives, An-Loor Dekad, Darren Drake, Arielech, Ernan Ferrouchi, Ernan Diego Megodosa and Alekantro Damian Panco," as stated in the statement of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been decades since the last time the Court of Justice of the South of New York exercised a probation on a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 for the Julus and Ethel Rosenberg spouses, who were executed after being conspired for a conspiracy in favour of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan national, seemed unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with his action, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack by an ISIS video he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to put the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to the police.
He pleaded innocent of the 22 categories recorded in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public lawyers representing Saidov, said they are "immediately disappointed" with the decision of the Prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty instead of acceptance of the life sentence with no chance of release will simply extend the trauma caused by all those involved," Patton said.
The Sifov defence team previously requested the prosecutors to refrain from demanding the imposition of a death penalty.
Toris MEP says that NIGHTEL FARAX should be set in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage swore to mobilize the people's army today during a protest gathering at the Toris conference.
Former UK Independence Party leader (UKIP) said politicians had to 'did' pressure from the Eurosceptics, as one of Teresa May's Members said that he should be the head of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bonn told the protesters at Birmingham that the United Kingdom would 'was already out' so far if Mr Farratz was the minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided Members was underlined by the fact that defenders of EU residence in Toris participated in a separate concentration of protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain under control the Chekers compromise plan by attacking Brexit's defenders, defenders of EU and EU residence.
The allies insisted on trying to reach agreement with Brussels in spite of the reactions and force the Eurosceptics and Workers to choose between her package and the 'huge'.
Mr. Boun said at the Leave Means Leave (Departure means departure) to Solihall that he wanted to fly "the Checkers Plan".
He said there was a title of politeness given to Mr Farratz and that he was given responsibilities for negotiations with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would have left now," he said.
The Welingboro MEP added: "I will support the Brexit but we have to throw out the Checkers plan."
In expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in global wars to become endless.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bonn rejected the allegations that public opinion had changed from the 2016 vote: "The memorial to the British people has changed their mind and wants the stay is completely out of touch."
The defender of the Brexit Member of the Torres Andrea Jenkins was also at the protest and told the journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checkers project does not have the approval of the well-publiced people, Anti-Population will not vote for it, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and downwards.
Please leave the Checkers Plan and start listening."
With a sharp message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farraj said at the protest gathering that politicians should be forced to 'uncompress pressure' if they are prepared to betray the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our policies," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, "We're not gonna let you get away with it if you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are about to betray the Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We replicate the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never be quiet until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the pro-residents in the EU protested at Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city center.
A few activists used to blow up the Toris banner against Brexit after gathering the team this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis has mocked up the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with by applying the party at the start of the conference.
"They are the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means they need for the EU-Canada pluralism agreement, for the inappropriate borders, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It doesn't mean good Brexit' she added.
Warren plans to seriously examine the possibility of nomination for the Presidency.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously consider the possibility of holding office after the November elections.
The Boston Globe report that the senator of the Massachusetts from Massachusetts spoke of her future plans during a gathering at a town in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticises President Donald Trump, claims to re-election in November, an opponent of the Republican State spokesperson Jeff Dull, who co-operated the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly believed that it can be dealt with with by Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was its 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall structures since Trump’s term began.
A party to the gathering asked her if she plans to put a candidate for the Presidency.
Warren said it was time to "go to Washington women to make our broken government, and that means a woman has to be at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU's basketball player Sims.
The police at Los Angeles' Baton Rouge announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect on the deadly shooting of the LSU Wade Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11 p.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help for the identification of the man on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot deadly near the University of Southern University early Friday.
"Wade Sims suffered a bullet in his head, which led to his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to Web network 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the point of possession of the gun and confessed that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without showing resistance and is being held at the Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
The third-year student Sims at a height of 1,98, who grew up in Baton Rouge in 32 matches, with 10 appearances as the main player of the last season, with an average of 17,4 minutes, 5,6 points and 2,9 rupods per race.
Gran Prie of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as the team's instructions gave him victory over Sebastian Fell
It became clear from the moment Valerie Botas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
At the beginning, Botas had a good start and almost hanged Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called on Fatell to attack his hostage.
Fetel went first in the pit and let Hamilton run in the race's tail, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits a round after he went out behind Fetel, but Hamilton came out in front after a wheel fight, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly abandon the internal risk of being forced to fall into the double-motion violation to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstapen began from the last position and was seventh at the end of his 21st birthday.
He then remained the first for a large part of the race as he held his tires aiming to end quickly and to move in front of Kimi Raconen in the fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed to the remaining eight rounds, as Raconen came fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valerie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team took them exceptionally and did one or two," Hamilton said.
Body language was very bad
President Donald Trumb sang Senator Diane Finstein at a gathering Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blaze Ford's letter, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavano of sexual assault.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president was not directly referring to the statement that Ford gave before the Senate Justice Committee, commenting on the fact that the Senate-sponsoreds proved that people are "battery and lame and liar."
"The only thing that could happen, and this beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate for the last few days, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and malicious and lame and liar," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you do the leak?
Remember her answer... you broke the document - "oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't break it down."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked, no, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
Finstein received the letter from Ford containing details of the charges against Cavano in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Finstein refused that the leak was carried out by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't break her story," said Finstein to the committee, as mentioned in the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret as he asked me."
But her refusal did not appear particularly to be told by the president, who commented during the Sabbath gathering: "I will tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language in the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of three women for sexual harassment, the president made it clear that Democrats use charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back using any necessary means.
You see the maliciousness, sport, they don't care who's hurting, who should walk to get power and control," the president said according to Mediaite news site.

Patrick Dwyer put two goals to the Giants against Dante.
Dante Stars got her defeat in Friday's Elite Lig race from Belfast Giants, winning the reception with 5-3 in Dandi on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kaoney brought the stadium on the stadium before Dwyer resets the Giants headline.

Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of airplane passengers from earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life in his attempt to secure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many were ignored because of a large earthquake that hit Sulawi Island on Friday, causing tsunami.
Powerful revolts continue to affect the area and many have been trapped in the city of Palos.
However, although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonys Gounwan Anjuang refused to leave his place in the control tower that was swinging, at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Paul.
He stayed in position to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the take-off run at that time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he believed he was falling apart.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Shiret said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, as the Australian television network ABC News transmitted.
We prepared a helicopter from Balkippan to Calimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another town.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived.
"We are shocked with his death," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the disaster management service of the country says that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of the dead is believed to grow further, as many bodies are still under ruins, and many of them have not been able to reach them," said the representative of the service, Sotopo Purpo Purgo Nugorocho.
Waves that arrived six meters destroyed the Old, which would be a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft get help and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute some ambulance brings bodies.
The fresh water is very small.
Mini brands are plundered everywhere."
Jean Gelphant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
Indonesian President Joco Windo arrived at Palau on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you to work on a night to bring to an end every evacuation-related work.
Are you ready? "translate CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, who cost life in more than 550 people.
An aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the crash of an aircraft in a lake
The airline operating a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man is missing, while earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the immersed aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release stated that since Saturday afternoon he is not able to find the traces of a man on the passenger.
The airline said she worked with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to track the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Varns of the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after impacting the plane in the water as he was trying to land at the airport of Chuck Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and the situation was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed on the lagoon outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought the plane went past the landing runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane went down very low.
"That's very good," Janes said.
Janes said he and others managed to move through the water that reached them as the middle of the emergency exits of the deep-rooted plane.
He said the air synods had paniced and shouted and he suffered a slight head injury.
The United States Navy reported that some seafarers who worked near to improve a dock were also helped to rescue using a fugitive boat to carry people to the shore before the sinking of the ship in a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline collisions registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none of these conflicts was involved by Air Niugini.
Analyst lists the time schedule of the night when a woman burned alive
The accusing authority completed its speech on Saturday in a repetitive trial of a man accused in 2014 of burning a woman from Mississippi alive.
U.S. Justice analyst Paul Rowlet reported for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used mobile phone files to put in line the moves of 29-year-old indicted Quinton Teleis and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location files from various cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, violating his previous claims, as the newspaper Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' phone the time he claimed to be with Michael Shanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the convicted authority asked him if Telis was telling the truth he was in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said, "He was lying because my truck was in Nasville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that she knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile records showed me they only met a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"She deleted from his life," Hale said.
The defense is going to start her speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he thinks that later on that day the trial will be put in the jury's judgment.

Another black guy?
Night in New York sues a couple who fired her after she got a "racial" message
A New York nanny was training a couple for racist release after an accidental message sent to her by the mother where her last complained that the nanny was "a black man."
The couple refuses to be racist, assimilating "extortion".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny Jesse Morice was black, when the last one appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"LINKIIIIIII EXTERNAL LEARN" wrote Mrs. Plasko Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her gaffle, the embarrassing Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that their incoming nanny, who was an African-American, had not done a good job and waited for a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for her one and only day of work and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mrs Morris appealed against the couple by asking for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation of $350 a day for the six-month period of work as an internal nanny, for which it was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he said on Post Friday, and added "I know it's a matter of discrimination."
The couple contradicts the claims that they are racists, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris as they feared they could not trust her again after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco said in Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had insulted, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
"Come on."
By assimilating the "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had been born only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you chase someone in this situation?
It's not so polite," the bank investor added.
While the legal case is under way, the public court has prompted the couple to condemn social media, condemning them of their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not be interested in a bear speaking, as a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankell, who was born a little after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who was reading it for the first time before his issue.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who worked as a picnicist at the BBC before inspiring to write the children's book from a lust bear, was optimistic for his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet" as her father left last year.
Regarding Paddington, which describes as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't a superstition," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of it even if it's not your feat in reality.
I think that's how she saw Paddington's success.
Although it was a creation of his own and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling me and he said it was too bad, that she didn't have much hopes for Mrs. Edna-Lapperz to make it," he said.
"Sometimes Nad called me to tell me he'd die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Thace, I love you very much, darling.
I'll come with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given to her to keep her heart alive slowly decreased and left her organization.
She had already died a little while ago, and now it was all gone.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all about.
I couldn't scream, shout, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs. Edna-Laperouz, who has so far grieved the loss of her daughter, has boarded the plane with the other passengers who ignored the test that went through.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I had my head down and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I got a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who mourn the loss of their own people hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones from suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a Wallace bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers that one can call to receive support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she started to suffer from depression and killed herself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I feel every day," he said.
The 45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him thanks to his smile.
They always said his smile was fond of the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was in a very bad state.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was at the time 11, was the one who found his brother after putting an end to his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm worried that there will be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the world there are people out there where you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you need to speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who's been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, just after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt convinced or sad or something," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had hit bottom on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look at them in the eyes."
He said his death caused a huge trauma to them, but they have to get over it: "Destroys the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

The future of Brett Cavanaugh is uncertain, as the FBI begins research
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited and limited research - maybe we could bring some unity," Mr Fleek said on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved in the midst of trapped party deadlocks.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance shall be entirely due to the timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks, on 6 November and, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person who wishes to the highest court in the country.
George Walker Bush calls to Senators, pressing them to support Mr. Cavano, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report was presented?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which is currently comprised of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would enable Mike Penns, the vice president, to get the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of apostates in North Korea falls under Kim's authority
The number of apostates from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young Eun stood in power seven years ago, according to a legislator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the Ministry of unification in South Korea, said there was 1.127 distances last year, compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges for migrants were key factors.
Pionyang has not made public comments.
North Korea's overwhelming majority of apostates finally offer South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul states that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, who are easier to cross as compared to the severely protected demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers apostate illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often deports them by violence.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are typically at war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pigning to discuss the negotiations on de-nuclearisation, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young Eun in Singapore, where they agreed with great conditions to work together to disarm the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused American sanctions of a lack of progress since.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will in no way disarm our country unilaterally first," said Mr Rim in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelossy calls Brett Cavano "State", says she's inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The Democrat president of the Nancy Pelozis Parliament called the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavano, and said he was self-evidently inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman were to behave like this, they would call her a "star" commented on the statement of Cavano before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied the charges of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Black Ford when both adolescents were.
During his inaugural speech, Cavano was deeply moved, sometimes he shouted, and his voice ran as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also unresolved the Democrats in the committee, describing the charges against him as "critical and coordinated political murder of a political character", organised by liberals who are angry at the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections of 2016.
Pelosi said that he believed Cavano's testimony proved that he cannot serve the Supreme Court as he showed that he was prejudicial to the Democratics.
"I think he ruled out himself in these statements and in the way he got against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelozi reacted when asked whether he would try to submit censures against Cavano if his appointment is confirmed and if the Democrats acquire the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court in which he is serving right now," Pelozi said.
Cavano is a judge at Columbia Regional Court (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that he was worried about Cavano's possible decisions regarding the Advantaged Care Act or Roy v Wade case as a conservative judge.
In the hearings on the confirmation of his appointment, Cavanaugh has been prevented from answering questions if certain judgments of the Supreme Court would have been overthrown.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudicial man to go to court and wait to say, "It's not wonderful?" said Pelosie.
Women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of wrath are over and can't get it out of her without crying.
Mrs. Steinim told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She kept saying, "He was very helpful to me, a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she too was crying when she was angry, but had developed a technique that when she was angry and began crying, she told the person to whom she was talking "maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
So he just kept going.
And it looked great."
The tears are allowed as an outburst of the rage partly because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of an old job, in a office where men were dominated, is once I crippled with high rage and grabbed me from the neck of a older woman - a cold manager that I always feared slightly - and took me into a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you cry." He said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they broke it off for you."
Patricia Sredder, then a Democrat senator from Colorado, had collaborated with Gary Hart in his campaign for the Presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an outrageous relationship on a ship named Monkey Business (Broody) and left the struggle humiliated, Mrs. Schreeder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason why he should not consider the idea of putting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as Snow White and the seven dwarfs.
Because the campaign had started for some time, he was back in funding, so he swore he wouldn't enter the election race unless he hadn't collected $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men were given to her only 250 dollars.
"They think I have a discount?" She wondered.
In her speech that announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very heavily loaded with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to gather money and target voters instead of representatives and anger with sex - who felt knot in the neck.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," she recalls Mrs. Srenter for the press reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write in my burial?
She cried."
How commercial war between the USA and China can do good in Beijing
The greetings of the trade war between the United States and China were obsolete and while the battle is too long to end, a rupture between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, the experts say.
American President Donald Trump dropped the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exporting products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation this week, with new duties of $200 million worth US $150 million, in fact by taxing all products imported into the USA from China.
Beijing returns every time fires in kind, and recently imposed duties of five to ten percent on $60 million worth of goods.
China is determined to return American fires and the world's second largest economy is not likely to put it down soon.
In order for Washington to be able to retreat, it should give in to their demands, but to masturbate public in the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jingping, China's president.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can properly play its cards, American pressures in the context of the trade war could be positively put on a counter-reduction in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hurrying political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have agreed in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, at the Center for New American Security (Centre for a New American Security), a pool of thought.
Syria is ready to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the seven-year-old country war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walind al Mualem said that conditions in the country improve.
"The situation in the country today is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave as a result of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures which affected their daily lives and biodiversity.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since 2011 that the war has broken out.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Mulam said that the aid for reconstruction of the devastated country is welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any conditional aid or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe locks victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 on the Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated six times in European soil and has won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the first place again, as the group of Danish leader Thomas Baryorne arrived at the 14.5 degrees they needed to defeat the United States.
The star of the U.S. team Phile Michelston, who fought hard in the longest part of the tournament, threw his shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole, granting the victory to Franchesko Molinari.
Italian team Molinari shine in all his lanes, so it became one of the four players who arrived at 5-0-0 since the present scheme of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Steph was defeated at 5&4 by the lowest in the European team's ranking, Danish Thorbgiorn Olsen.
The player best ranked in the world, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last game in a Rider Cup.
The Spanish veteran eight Cuplons Ryder, Sergio Garcia, was crowned the most winning European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25.5.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't hold myself.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for picking me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we took the cup back.
Everything is for the team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said, moved after the European victory.
He gives the dog to John Ram's compatriot, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an atomic game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride that I defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now he has a career record at the Rider Cupe 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has surpassed it only by Jack Niklaus.
The team of the U.S. team had a hard time last weekend finding a target, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
American chief Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
Some moments this morning we had enough pressure on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big chief.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the US PGA and the Ryder Cup and move forward.
I love those 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
