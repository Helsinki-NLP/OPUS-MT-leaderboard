Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have any secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than I am.
Tom's living in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You look disappointed.
Tom knows everything about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We're laughing too much.
Tell me what you'll get in the tests.
I think two languages aren't enough.
Can I borrow your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should talk.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church with the car.
You're much smarter than I am.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's going home at three o'clock.
I showed him to my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not losing it.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish is not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have any?
He's a student of the jutsu high school.
You'll see.
I'm not happy with that.
They're gone again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is he all right?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you're working?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We put the house in green.
Time and place of meeting have closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I got a promotion recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.

I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I passed out.
I wish I wasn't Candide.
Everything glowing isn't gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
My phone's ringing.
Throw his dirty clothes on the floor.
You're a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than I am.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
That book is yours.
Tom knew who he was at his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is that?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our cattle.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.

Thomas lives in a commune with hippies.
The water's hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was urgent.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom's going to live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canaide?
People today pay more attention to people's culture than before.
Tom's no longer my friend.
It's too clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
You put your hair on?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
Every day I walk.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.

Do you know who he is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her phone.
I wanted to die.
Same is doing whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You 18?
I want to do sport.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek legends?
He's up for 40.
What time do you guys leave?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain has come to us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her in love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hug Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
What do you call that?
Laurie's still in school.

I've been in Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We spent three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks French inconveniently.
I'm higher than you.
Have you lost the receipt?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.

I'm gay.
You're easy to access.
It's not Tom's a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
Those keys aren't mine.

There's a lot of money.
This won't happen again.

Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.

What brings you here?
I did what I was sleeping.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow was hard on view.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
There's a house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's jealous a little.

Now's your chance.
You can choose any book you want.

I broke up in tears.
He's talking like a truck driver.

Ever since I was married, I don't work anymore.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a donkey?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm kind of tired, too.
You sure you don't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He walks slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father a Japanese man?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm in a hole right now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.

I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I was born Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't participate in the conversation.
Be careful: In English and in the minds of the nationalities, in the days of week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril; I am happy for the acquaintance!
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's sleeping.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sammy peeped and fucked in Lyla's toilet.
When I grow up I'm going to be a pilot, what do you want to be?
Do you have any sugar?
I went home.
The language is a living organism.
Can you help Tom?

I left for London.
I love dogs.

It's cold; why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
Birds are red.
Get me a glass.

Makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?
Tom's John's brother.

The girls were looking at each other.
Brazil is the biggest country in South America.
I like running.
Sammy says it's your security.

Dimensions do not need to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything may be a night space provided that the addition between the nights and the multiplication with a calibration of size is defined.
His money's at the bank.
I'm so shy.
I love my country.
We got into a serious conversation.
They've come.
I guess someone likes Tom.

He's been writing me less and less these days.
Put it down.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.

You're smaller than me.
She eats.
I need your car.

You may be right.
Oxygen is necessary for combustion.
Is everything okay?

What are you reading?
Okay, thanks.
Only I can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom owed money to Mary.

Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
Harder.

Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're vivid.
I'm convinced.
She's my daughter.
I was talking to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm shy.
We'll have a visit to our friends.
I'm a lot of frequency.
And speaking of genocide, today is Columbus Day.
Sammy hired another maid.
I want some orange juice.
The toilet entrance's too dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to go now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our trouble.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't even given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not gonna reveal her secrets.
Mary's answering the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I get drunk at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't seek that word in dictionary, I don't know the Arab alphabet.
Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadians.
I'll be in the car.
What is the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two lessons.
I'd like him to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page 10.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room I could barely move.
He'll visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?

I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I was eating something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is too small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everybody started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It is indeed a good theory, the only disadvantage that I think has is probably common to all philosophical theories.
Why am I not surprised by him?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm really mad at you now.
I thought you were Japanese.
He's got a lot of fuss here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than her.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of the three.
You asked them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I suppose you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.
Is Tom going to die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain unanswered.
I like Irish music.
Give me a spoon.

Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want some soup.
What?
Where did you get the key?
Can't that be right?
Tom can't stand the hot and wet summers here, so he went to the mountains.
Bill, call me over tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
It's Italian, isn't it?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had lots of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you up?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need a mosquito.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as his legs could take him.
I like fishing.
I don't like those candy.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.

It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love mushroom taste.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was so hungry.
When is your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I did how I was asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary's tactical with strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is difficult.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Slow down.
Put the book on the others.
The bird's in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canaeza.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
You're sending them a message?
Can I borrow a pencil?
We only have three options.
The Moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom snoops.
Do not turn out the light.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously unhappy.
You're not a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.

Thank you, you're fantastic.
Is Israel going to attack Iran?
I like to laugh.

He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father's rich.
You're new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It is not difficult for the French.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
All repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language do they speak to Switzerland?
Help me lift him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does she hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
How long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay real estate.
That's a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before it's late.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a letter.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father's gone.
I want something to tell you.
She's using you.
He's never been to Okinawa before.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus ride isn't boring.
Who sold Tom's car to?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first I couldn't understand it.

I like sports.
I have money.
I've been waiting for you at 2:30.
I don't think it's good for you to go out with him.
I won't tell anyone about you.
Tom sang some old songs.
Who's that penny?
Mark is not as tall as Marios.
I'm very pleased with your results.

I have two mother tongues.
I'm not gonna sue you.
What happened?
We heard the news that you've been through the exam.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
We're not the only Canadians here.
I'm looking for Tom.
What the hell was I thinking?
Tell them I'm here.
I figured you were Canadian.
I thought you were Canadians.
Where's her family?
Tom's running every day?
Thank you for helping me!
I don't want them.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
Open fire!
We went to church every Sunday.
Tell her we'll be ready.
May I accompany you to the front door?
She's still studying.
I don't want it.
Tom ran.
She's not my wife.
I want to know what's in the box.
She's younger than your sister.
When do your holidays start?
Tom danced.
What did you say?
I've already talked to Tom about it.
The Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
I want some water.
I'm not sick.
He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you use is slow.
I left the door open.
Tell him not to come.
He ate all the apple.
I'm not kidding.
I'm bored.
She's different.
I just moved.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You're smarter than her.
I want this TV.
She's tired.
We'll be done in an hour or so.
I'd like to write a book about Cyprus.
Tom's turning the table, right?
Tell them your theory.
I could find my trouble if I did that.
Where's the Greek embassy?
I'm your teacher.
Tell her you're sick.
Where are your keys?
Tom died in 2013.
I'm writing a letter to Maria.
Tom and Mary love each other.
I'm sure I'll find a way.
Why are you so sad?
The chairs will be here tomorrow.
Would you like some water?
Tell them.
As far as I know, Tom could be dead.
She's smart, isn't she?
Tom is always willing to help.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We're students.
Does anyone know Japanese?
Tom's not smart.
He was born rich.
That's a flag.
Tom reluctantly agreed.
I'm playing violin.
Pack your things and go.
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green one.
We have to get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom was forced to walk for school when he was little.
They robbed me.
Only we can save them.
Maybe someone should like Tom.
It always works a lot.
You ruined him.
When did you arrive?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I may admire other people, but I never tried to be anyone other than myself.
I don't trust women.
I suggest you read that book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next sentence.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What's the most read book in the world?
In the bay, the iron sticks.
Is that your book?
You're much smarter than I am.
Tom's about the same age as you.
That's the target.
My grandson cries very hard.
Can you take over here?
We need more coffee.
I'm fine, thanks.
I'll be ready.
What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.
He decided to cut the cigarette.
We're closing at 2:30.
I never hit Tom.
Looks like she lied.
You won't like what I'm about to say.
When are you leaving?
What time does the store open?
I don't know French.
You ruined him.
By your mouth and to God's ears!
You shot her.
You like them.
Water is not drinking.
Is she eating the apple?
You better stay here.
Tom's a year older than Mary.
We're all trying to help you.
The girl is beautiful.
I'll come with you.
Where's the money, Tom?
Where are you working?
They're actors.
Can you speak my tongue?
Aren't you going to Australia to build shops?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Pull straight until you see the mail, then turn right.
You don't have to talk so hard.
Tom eats a lot.
There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
He'll walk.
You're ready.
We've recognized it.
She's on a diet.
You're sick, you need to rest.
Tom is obedient.
I underestimated him.
Are you really Canadians?
Suddenly I started taking weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
That's Ali's book.
It was my husband's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.
I've got ten pens.
Appreciate that.
Have you paid all the bills?
Did you buy flowers?
Tom's approached.
You told her.
Don't step on the dog's tail.
Tom's mad at us.
I bought you red roses.
Tom made Mary cry.
He won a phone.
You look tired.
Not much people like Tom.
You're stronger than me.
Tom's still in Australia.
I heard you.
Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care whether you like it or not.
To forgive others is an act of kindness to yourself.
My goal is to know your tongue.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
I thought you were a Canadian.
It was a bad choice.
Here's my scarf.
I woke up and saw that my briefcase was missing.
What have you eatin'?
I think I'm listening to them.
My neighbor's name is Tom.
I've inspected Tom many times in Boston.
We got wine.

At first I couldn't understand it.
They like fruit in Tom.
That was my box.
He started singing.
He speaks French.
We all want prices to fall.
It's got to work hard.
Tell them we don't want to go.
Can I help you?
You were happy.
Were you alone?

You want something?
That's communism.
I like these.
Tom translated the contract into French.
The cat is lazy.

No one translates my proposals!
I like turtles.
Tom will decide.
I want you to die.
No one lives there.
Look at my arm.
Tell them not to be late.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm proud of you.
The sea is green.
They're older than you.
Are you having fun?
Why are you angry?
Tell them I'm ready.

The cat's safe.
He doesn't drink coffee.
Do you need them?
He's a man at the door.

Give me one more chance.
Let me introduce you.
If time allows it, we leave tomorrow.

Eye for an eye and road for a road.

Are you taller than Tom?
Yesterday I went to the park with Mary.
I'm the only one who didn't have to.
He's awake.

I'm sorry, what time is it?
We've got three kids.
Tell them to help me.

My job is to teach English.
This brings me great joy.
Tell them I won't do that.
I love Boston.
I'd like to help you.
It's killing me, Lord.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Try to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
You're late last night.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope it went well.
I'm human.
Everybody likes money.

You're not poor.
We're gonna go visit Tom.

Were you alone?
We need more drivers.

Nobody's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.

I understand.
If you can follow me, please.
He started talking to the dog.

I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm twenty-three years old."

There was a big castle in my city.
He's in front of the door.
I think they're only going to Australia to have fun.
Tom's cheeks got red.
I'm Richard.
What did you open him with?
Would you like a trip to Australia?
I think she's sick.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
Tom will understand.
Where'd she kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
I had my birthday yesterday.
Tom has Canadian passport.
Tell them I'm here.
Tom has never asked me for money.
She really helped me.
Airplanes allow people to travel long distances quickly.
Don't you have anything better to do?
In my opinion, you're handsome.
Let's all go home now.
The rain stops, the game starts again.
Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We're well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to put me to bed, right?
Is it raining?
He's too slippery.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I think he's my friend.
What were you doing there?
It's time you'll understand it.
I'll eat it.
Tell her to stop.
I told him.
We're from Boston.
Does Tom know French?
These cars are made in Japan.
Can I ask you something?
I'm working at a bank.
We'll stop you.
The global warming is on orbiting the mountain peaks in simple rocks in less than ason.
"Did you do this Monday?" "No, I didn't."
Tom's smiling.
She loves Tom, not me.
I'm pretty strict with it.
Cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Choose who you want.
I live on Park Street.
Where's the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
The kids are sleeping.
You look disappointed.
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're much faster than I am.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me that's not true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom's popular.
That's very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog is white.
When are you coming?
Mary's my wife.
Looks like someone's calling you.
How many tickets did you get?
I was never in Paris.
Tom's been visiting Australia three times.
It'll snow today.
I heard voices.
No, thanks, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom said it was unfair.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I'll fight.
Millie doesn't eat an apple.
I don't like wine.
You're smarter than her.
How much do you want?
Who knows the answers?
They killed Tom.
I'm rarely eating out.
Kneel!
Please hurry.
You're drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France, but not in Holland.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.
You called them to the party?
You need to clean your class.
Why are you laughing?
We've got a lot of schools.
Mary blackmails Tom.
He doesn't talk; he screams!
Are you from Australia?
They won.
What were you eating?
We're proud of Tom.
The horses are animals.
You're smarter than them.
Love what you do.
What football team do you support?
I get up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom shoved his fists.
They ate at the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, what are you doing?
I won't tell anyone you're in Boston.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Anything else?
Tom's single.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We'll paint it.
That's easy to say, hard to do.
She showed me her room.
When will he be?
Australia is a nice country.
They'll fix it.
I don't care if you go or not.
It was weird.
No one understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than her.
Let me make my position clearer.
I never understood that.
She's washing her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will show.
I won't be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.
Tom left for Boston.
Tom's not fair.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom's not your brother.
Where are you from, my friends?
I've had a lot of coffee.
He likes walking.
The man is young.
He's not a Algerian.
My car's faster than yours.
I don't live in Boston.
Tom likes all my friends.
What does she want?
Stop your stupidity.
Our campus has a good library.
My horse's white.
Tom's back from Australia.
I'll sit with you.
I'll call you tonight.
I'm from Kyoto.
He's obsessed with his wife.
Can I have one of these?
Pass my pepper, please.
Was anyone in the car?
That's my baby.
Nobody moved.
French is not an easy language.
Tom's back home tired.
Stop Tom.
They're bigger than her.
Did you hear her speak French?
I read a book last night.
He's been accused of neoplasmism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom had to accept things the way he was.
How old are you?
He likes to read the papers.
We'll find them.
My father was Greek.
They were mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill us all.
He didn't know what to say.
I wouldn't like to lie to her.
I saw Tom at the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston by October.
Let me make my position clearer.
Is this important?
I figured you were Canadians.
You bought a new house.
You never cared about me.
The thief was disguised by a police officer.
Can I get you out of this?
I thought we might stay here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be fighting all the time.
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
He knew it all along.
Everything went well.
Emily asked me a question.
Tell them to come and see me.
You played.
I wonder what route is shorter.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope to see you soon.
Carol reads Spanish.
Everybody's agreed to his idea.
Come quickly.
You have to stay.
I grew up in that neighborhood.
That's hard.
I'll fight.
He's still here.
Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
He met him three years ago.
Tom translated the document from French in English.
It was empty.
‘Thank you.’
I have something to say.
Everybody's waiting for Tom.
Tom did this to you?
You need to help your friends.
I'm not gonna lie.
Who did you go to the dance with?
You're not contributing enough.
You're my best friend.
Tom's achievements are impressive.
Give me what you got.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me alone here.
Tell them it's important.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too old for Mary.
Who found the phone?
He forgot to turn out the light.
Give me 30 minutes.
They look happy.
They work hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You destroyed it.
You have a few books.
We're ready to help.
About what your teacher asked you?
Tom loved Mary very much.
Is that yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom's afraid I'm lost.
I'm so tired.
I want to learn guitar.
Do you like your car?
Mayor chosen.
Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
It makes my life a torture.
Tom gave me this tie.
I wish I were born Canaide.
I miss him.
Were you happy?
She's happy.
You're incredibly idiots.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom sick?
What do you want?
We like children.
He was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need her.
I like dancing.
You got the wrong key.
I thought Tom was Canadian.
They were young.
She died fast.
Are you angry?
What are you doing?
Tom's a mathematician.
You're Tom's friend?
How did you lose it?
Every year the world population grows two percent on average.
Tom was the main suspect.
I thought you were Canaide.
I'd never think I'd meet you here.
I want you to sing.
Let me go!
Tom killed Mary.
You speak Hebrew?
Who'd Tom sell his car to?
You're very curious.
Come here right now.
French speaking.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
Yeah, sure.
Your husband is cheating on you.
He's a obedience to Tom.
Traders only look at profits.
He married him for his money.
A lot of people in the world like spicy food.
Mary plays piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to sleep now.
I want to live in Brazil.
You do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied to her.
English is not my mother tongue.
Will you give me your size, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his flaws, but I like it.
Don't believe it.
Who is your teacher?
I always hear music; I can't live without her.
It'll be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom's very quiet.
He made me a cake.
Is your car fast?
This morning, I got up from 7:00 a.m.
What the hell did Tom mean by that?
He's a quiet man.
I ran to the bus station so I wouldn't lose the last bus.
Thomas told me Mary was in jail.
I'm fine, thanks for asking!
I saw Tom last Monday walking with Mary in the park.
They've sold the TV.
If you have anything to say, say it.
This house isn't much.
Tom was busy.
I like to laugh.
I'm rich.
You want to marry me?
I like music and English.
He slept at ten yesterday.
You haven't even told me who you are yet.
I've got so many books like Tom.
I like that song.
You're a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me one more chance.
There's a book stack at the table.
We should choose the right person for every place.
Think first!
You trust this man?
Who's gonna count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't come near the dog.
Yes, I'm coming!
Tom's wife and children miss him.
Where did you go on Sunday?
Keep both your hands on the wheel.
He made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was she born?
That's unprecedented.
No one ever came to see me at the hospital.
You're not thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's so fun to listen to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is small, though the smile lasts only one second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother's here.
Betie's been here lately.
Did he admit it?
It seems to me that you don't often help other people.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
Next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know a lot of pilots.
We were fighting to survive.
We're not afraid.
You want this?
You're not yourself.
They were yours.
The house is too big for us, and besides that it's too expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They're smiling.
He kissed you? Yes, I knew it!
I'm on deck.
I have more money than you.
Tell me about your son.
You still in Park Street?
Unlock the door.
He's so young.
Tom and Mary are living, but they're not legally married.
We went to a nice restaurant.
You don't hate Tom.
They trust him.
Are you members of a gym?
Where do you want to go?
There are books here.
I helped my father yesterday.
Nonsense!
I was just doing what Tom asked me to do.
Tom told us not to be afraid.
I need to learn French.
Two beers, please.
Tom will survive.
Laurie lives in Melbourne.
Lock the door.
I was moved by that fact.
Let me make my position clearer.
They don't need money.
Mary's Tom's kind of wife.
That boy has black hair.
What do you know about Australia?
No one knows how it works.
You look tired.
We were both hungry.
She died last week.
Tell them to stop worrying.
Everybody laughed.
She lost her money, her family, her friends.
Tom's got red hair.
Please cancel my order and return the money.
It's green.
Tom's an actor.
Tom showed Mary the pictures.
It's none of your business!
I can't lend you that book.
Tom saw Mary work.
Tell them you're not ready.
I'm a translationer.
I think I have a lot to offer.
I'll show you.
You're staying here tonight.
I told Tom not to use them.
I refuse to accept that.
We all know you.
Have some water.
In the dog, I like cats.
Are you alive?
He's a good singer.
Tell him I'm sick.
Tom passed away in 2013 in Australia.
My love for you is hard to explain.
What's that?
Why did you stop?
Tom saved her from the fire.
Food is good.
I'll accompany you.
Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The roads are covered with snow.
How happy I am today!
I don't see you.
She let me see her daughter.
My house is near school.
I assumed you were Canaide.
You were busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I'd like you to stay with me.
Tom was married to Canaide.
I'll wait for you at 2:30 here.
Rejection hurts.
I hope that will continue.
I thought I heard Tom's voice.
What were you saying?
Come with me to Boston.
Do you swim often?
I was awkward with all these people seeing me.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom blackly painted his hair.
Yeah, I'll be right back.
I got it for funny, and I didn't answer.
Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy it?
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and prepared me a dinner.
My favorite color is orange.
Are you a Canadian citizen?
I'll be waiting for you 2:30.
Has anyone come?
Tom laughed when Mary said that.
Mary's my wife.
He's looking forward to seeing him again.
Tom migrated to Australia in 2013.
Is there bread?
Throw him out.
I'll watch TV.
See you in about an hour.
My last husband was such an idiot.
You look busy.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Do you like to put me to bed?
Her husband's got great cough.
He lied to us.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
They're Canadians?

We're worried about you.
I'm a woman.
You're rich.
You work hard.
We're clean.
I love you so much.
Do you see them?
I know what it's like to be poor.
You like your new job?
Good to see you again.
How am I gonna find it?
She's the most beautiful woman.
A week ago, I had tooth export.
You can get a taxi.
I rarely watch documentary.
Tom told Mary to sit down.
I can read English, but I can't talk to them.
I think I know why you're here.
The name of that kid is Tom.
A friend in need is really a friend.
Speak of the devil.
He thought it was a genius.
I like green tea.
I want to leave early today.
His father dedicated his life to science.
Michael broke the dishes.
Tom married a Canadian.
A naive fox doesn't exist, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No thoughts!
I won't be there.
I like your car.
This road is dangerous.
You like driving fast cars?
Take my handkerchief.
Watch out for yourself on this rock.
When did you finish it?
Kids like to drink fruit juice.
You'll learn to speak Portuguese inappropriately!
Tom has good eyesight.
They didn't like the idea to Tom.
What's he gonna order to the restaurant?
They burned the paper.
The paper is easily burned.
I thought she was fine.
I wish I wasn't a Canadian.
I don't understand the music.
You're very curious.
Tom's writing late.
What shoe number are you wearing?
He ate dinner.
Bring them with you.
You need to go.
I don't understand.
Tom didn't play well.
Did you buy him on the black market?
Found the company.

We helped them.
We'll continue the conversation.
I'm paying for dinner today.
The Japanese are Asian.
What are they doing?
We're waiting for Tom.
I saw them today.

I'd like you to attend the meeting tomorrow.
I don't think Tom was joking.
My cat's white.
What time is it in London?
What else did you tell him?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I can't remember any day Tom getting off.
Tell them I'm not here.
Tom's gonna change.
What are they gonna do?
Tom told the kids a lot of stories.
She wants you to kiss her.
That's the best dictionary in the library.
It's a dead end.
Tell me what you want.
Do you like me?
I want to see you dance.
Tom was dressed in black.
Where did you go?
That's my table.
Life isn't fair.
Tom and Mary were busy.
Do you like Boston?
There's a bottle in the fridge.
Don't start yet.
Tom wants me.
We want one.
They canceled the race because of rain.
Dan and Linda were married between 1994 and 2002.
I've been waiting for her for a long time.
You will obey.
Don't leave me like that.

Tom's gonna die.
I'm too exhausted to think, let alone read.
Germany was excluded from South Korea.
Why did he run away?
Jump!
You're older than me.
Tom thought Mary was depressed.
You can't teach a crab to walk straight.
We left him some cakes.
Where was she born?
You're the one who's talking.
You're a liar.
You look pale.
You shot her.
We know you're hurting.
I wish I had gone with Tom in Australia.
Carry on, please.
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me.

This political party is environmentally very conscious.
Fortunately he didn't die in the accident.
Tom sang us a French song.
Don't let Tom go out.
Are you Mary's husband?
I don't think Tom should be here today.
No one encouraged her.
He can't drive.
It was expected.
This chair is comfortable.
Tell them you don't need him.
He likes the cardboard.
The strong one must help the impossible.
I need a computer.
Tom looks tired.
Tell him I won't do that.

You're much smarter than I am.
Why were you late this morning?
Call me at night.
Would you like meat or fish?
Tom's already dead.
Tom ignored Mary.
When did you buy him?
Tell him to leave.
We want to create the least possible disruption.
We were born that same day.
You're undecided.
She promised me she would come.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I always dreamed about going to Australia.
You can wait here.
I laughed too much.
When I first met her, she was around 30.
We were looking for treasure.
It's Tom's.
I'm chasing after Tom.
All people are mortal, all Greeks are human, so all Greeks are mortal.

Come quickly!
I've never been to Paris.
He tortured a prisoner.
You're all perfect.
Where's the money?

You like red wine?
Who were they talking about?

Good luck to convince him.
Why are you smiling?

That's unfair.
I'm talking French.
Can I borrow your headphones?
I don't remember his little name.
We'll meet at the theatre.
You think this is a game?
I haven't seen a heterosexual in a week.
The man visits Moscow.
Tom said he was going to Boston in October.
Tom didn't want to go out without his hat and gloves.
When did you get married?
Are you drunk?
You're an attractive woman.

They don't have what we want.
You're so handsome.
Simplicity is virtue.

Tom walked.
Where do you work?
Nice suit.
Please come before 2:30.
I'm a man.

Someone needs to talk to Tom.
His real name is Tom.
We can't change the story, but we can learn from it.
He's not married.
Your English is perfect.
Tom has money.
Asshole!
It doesn't rain.
Tell them you're not ready.
What are you going to order at the restaurant?
Let's wait for Tom.

I slept all day.
Which city do you live in?
Didn't you read the story?
It weighs over 80 pounds.
My parents are in Australia.
My guitar's new.
They're gonna fix him.
Where are you going?
You should memorize all those dates.

Aren't you happy?
He was alone.
Tell them I'm innocent.
I've seen this picture before.
She didn't let me read the letter.
I need time to prepare.
I live in Turkey.

Don't get out without a hat.
Tell them you're not ready.
These are Tom's friends.
Let me finish.
I love fish.
How much do you owe?
Tom surrendered.
Don't leave me alone.
Thomas was attacked by an unknown man on the subway.
You're two years younger than me.
I was trying to kill my time.
It's all gone very expensive.

It's dangerous!
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Time's three.
Tell her I'm in the office.

You want to be famous?
He showed me the collection of his stamps.
I hope the weather is good.
We supported each other.
I need some advice.
How long do you think it'll last?
They're older than you.
And more than anything I hate wearing socks.
Good night, Mom.

You're a good journalist.
It's not Christmas today!
Please stop wetting.
When did you buy a bike?
Who are you?
I hate puzzles.
I like short hair.
I have more money than you.
They want sex, rich and glory.
Hold both your hands on the wheel.
I'll be around 2:30 in Boston.
You have to find him.
I don't trust you.
I told them to stop.
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my wallet.

I want to find a good job.
You're my best friend.
You can choose what you want.
Tom saw Mary.
You'll be fine without me.
I'm sorry, I'm taking back what I said.
Who teaches you French?
You never trusted me.
Where were you this morning?
They're walking around woods.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom has years to speak French.
They recognized her.
I thought you'd find it interesting.

We want to go back to Boston.
I know you work hard.
Tom eats a sandwich.
What else could we do?
Attack!

Tell him I'm ready.
They were hungry.
Mary told me that she thought Tom was divorced.
I got the list.
Emily read that book.
I look forward to my retirement.
He'll be watching you.
I punished them.
That dress is cheap.
I don't believe you!
Where's Tom?
I don't even remember where I bought this from.
You haven't even told me who you are yet.
I'm wearing a flower dress.
Tom told his taxi driver to turn left.
I underestimated them.
I decided it wasn't too late.
I'll be late.
I'd like your help.
I never trusted you.
Tom eats his evening with Mary.
The dog fell asleep on the blanket.
My two sisters look perfect.
You don't see well.
Where's school?
Remember who I am?
We got three dogs.
What did you open it with?
Please don't worry.
What did Tom write?

Were you busy last night?
The wasps killed the spider.

The bus is full.
Tell her we'll be ready.
The magnets, of course, have a magnetic field around them.
Can I borrow your pencil?
Are you going to stay?

Why do you hate Canadians so much?
You're a Canadian, aren't you?
Tell him I'm ready.
Drying is one of the rare individual elements.
Can you correct my English proposals?
We haven't talked about it yet.
A naive fox doesn't exist, but, respectively, there's no impeccable human being.
Our team needs your help.
They know you're here?
What were you telling him?
Tom reassured Mary.
Who are you meeting?
How many tiles do you have?
Tom's very disappointed.
Please let me through.
Thomas is Mary's grandson.
Tom's gone for Boston.
Don't be shy.
I can't ever remember Tom getting off.
You're running every day?
I was so tired when I got home last night.
I bought a house.
What's your favorite dessert?

They love me.
Tell him why.
Sometimes I understand you.
I wanted to pay.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
Do you need any help?
I can't believe Tom would do that.
Tom knows us well.
Don't ask him who he is.
Tom and I are not Canadians.
Are you really Canaide?
I don't have a ticket.
I was thinking about the planes.
I gave Mary a book.
These boots are expensive.
I assumed you were a Canadian.
Whose books are there?
Did you like Boston?
Yeah, you're right.
Do you know where you're going?
He's totally drunk.
I told him to come.
If you have anything to say, say it.

He's selling cars.
Go straight ahead until you see the mail, then turn right.
We'll find you.
If I wasn't broke, I'd buy it.
She advised him to take the medicine.
We have to buy it from abroad.
I visited Boston.
Are you sure about that?
Their meeting was inevitable.
Tom slept in the car.
That's what I don't like.
Leave your pockets and put everything on the table.
Those shoes don't work for me.
Usually I play football after school.
Do you want to go or not?
The snow will soon disappear.
Tom still doesn't believe it.
Tom was happy everyone had enough to eat.
When are you going to do that?
Were you happy?
Do you still hate French?
You two have a lot in common.
I'm gonna go get Tom.
Tom and Sue love each other.
There's nowhere left for more than three weeks.
You text her?
We identified her.
Stop judging me.
Can you make a vertical?
Are you pregnant?
I just read that book.
Our school has nine classes.
I'll wait for you in the stop.
That's a table.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
You have to learn not to ask so many questions.
Why did I do that?
Don't drink on an empty stomach.
I'm ready to talk.
You wanted to kill Tom?
Tom wants to be famous.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You need to come with me.
Give me that bottle.
Tom's joking.
He left a window open.
Tom drove the car.
Looks like I lost my keys.
I can't talk about it.
How much have you killed?

The witnesses must file in oath.
We're gonna need it.
Easy to get bad habits.
Tom agreed.
I'm doing the same thing every night.
He's not optional.
Tell them you'd like to leave.
Do you often borrow your car, Tom?
He was lucky enough to catch up on the train.
Would you like another glass of water?
You're eating your time.
What happened on the beach?
You should be on my side.
Don't talk like that about my girlfriend.
Tom's our friend.
What did Thomas and Maria learn from us?
My pen is in my hands.

You're losing.

Looks like someone's calling you.
Kim smiled sweetly.
It's not cheap.
You were guilty.
Your French are perfect.
How many died?
Tell her I'm innocent.
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?
As soon as I get up, I'm making coffee.
You're mature.
You'll be happy.
You have to try to encourage Tom to try again.
She promised to check it out.
My brother's guitar is new.

How's your mother?

Excuse me, where's the beach?
Party is tomorrow.
Are you gonna tell them?

Yesterday we played tennis.
Tell him I'm ready.
Your clothes are all stinking.
What have we lost?
I wonder why he's so angry.
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
What was I thinking?
I'm not busy today.
You like rap?
Let me introduce you.
Damn it!
We need more egos.
Your car's ready.
Who shot you?
You're ready.

Take them with you.
You told him.
We won't win.

Warning Tom.
I'm afraid of cats.
Tell me what to do.
What exactly do you intend to do with that?
Tom drinks a lot of beer.
Are you drunk?
In college, we were competing with each other.
Tom hugged Mary and kissed her.
She became a teacher.
They'll fix it.
It makes me sad, I think it was unfair.
We have to work together.
I'm so shy.
I'll tell Emily.
Stop right now.
We are faced with a difficult situation.
We grew up together.
Where were you in 2003?
They obeyed.
The property is stealing.
I suppose you're Canadian.
We're on a diet.
This one's for free.
I'm talking about you.
I have something to tell you.
Please don't interrupt me.
Why did you lie to me?
It's Serbia's third largest city.
There's not a lot of books in it.
We all speak French.
It's spending a lot of money.
Don't open this box.
Did Tom kill himself?
Who cried?
The exceptions confirm the rule.
Call the doctor!
He played the piano.
That's ours.
Greeks often eat fish.
You want to tell her?

Tom knows us well.
I bet Tom knows the answer.
Do you run every day?
Looks like someone's calling you.
And Tom and I are Canadians.
I'm usually patient enough.
Is Tom home?
I like those two.
I was born in Israel.
Someone poisoned them.
It's totally my fault.
These gloves don't fit me.
You're young.
Are they selling flowers in this store?
He's brave enough to go there alone.
We'll take it.
We'll get a little too far.
Their father had a big shoe shop in town.
Tom's trying.
He made me cake.
How many have you killed?
I made two.
We haven't seen Tom in weeks.
We're champions.
It was from Australia.
I need your car.
We were both very busy.
They recognized him.
Tom wears white socks.
Tell Tom we'll be ready.
Can I talk to the doctor?
When I was sick, Tom came by and cooked me dinner.
I love her and she loves me.
Were you happy?
Our teacher is an idiot.
Thomas's shopping.
Meat, please.
I was asked to quit the company.
Tom's talking fast.
He doesn't want me to talk about this.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
I'm very strict about that.
Where's Paris?
You're stronger than that.
Her mother lives alone in the country.
Tom should have learned French.
I have to hide.
You don't understand women, Tom.
Tom loves baseball.
Let Tom swim.
Tom's good in math.
I'm afraid I should ask you to leave.

Hold your breath.
I'll read it.
Did you think I was Candide?
Pour some water.
Tom recognized Mary's voice.
I can't believe Tom ate the whole chicken on his own.
Are you ready for spring?
Tell her you're not ready.
Is Laurie home?
We'll try again.
The mother tongue of Iulia is Italian.
That'll help.
I tricked them.
We're all Canadians.
I can't forget her.
Tom doesn't live here anymore.
I'm not on Tom's side.
Why didn't you warn Tom?
Tom terrified Mary.
I visit Algeria often.
Where are you going, Tom?
You'll regret it!
Religion is a controversial topic for many people.
I do not welcome his attitude.
I'll be waiting for you 2:30.
Most of them are Canadians.
Tom will forgive you.
Stop her.
