Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have any secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you get on the exams.
I think two languages are not enough.
Could you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should talk about it.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write down everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to know French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish is not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student, Jutsu.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They've lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is he okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you're working?
Can anyone explain that to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting have been closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I got promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
Garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canada.
What shines isn't gold.
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
My phone's ringing.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a reporter?
Tom's a head taller than I am.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was inside his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is this?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our cattle.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie commune.
The water's hot.
You need to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was urgent.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canada?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than to the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you paint your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We may need some.
That's a suggestion.
How did you spend the vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Do we have a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find them for you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house is completely ruined.
Tom's got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who that is?
Did you see baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her phone.
I wanted to die.
Same thing does to me whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not a question of money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You're 18?
I want to do sport.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The honor was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
It's 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
Our captain is welcome.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw it with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text shall not be read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
What do you call that?
Laurie's still in school.
My office is downtown.
He's got two sisters.
You're not Canada.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom interrogated Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tiring.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom wears gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks French in vain.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost proof?
Are you afraid to lose your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news cheered him up.
We were enemies.
Who's got him?
We have nowhere to go.
How many blocks can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?
Tom's from Boston.
Tom drinks every day.
The cat's under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't watch any TV at all.
I'm the coach.
Tom will be working this afternoon.
Who's that?
Dinner.
She convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the puzzles.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom painted the wall pink.
We're too busy.
Harder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" yell.
It worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're a trustworthy man.
He's not a hero, Tom.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
Those keys aren't mine.
She was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and say it again.
Turn on the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.
Russia's great.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit around for a long time.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I did what I was asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow has made visibility difficult.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now's your chance.
You can choose any book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom's not Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
Did you think I was Canada?
I'll be with you.
I have not received an answer to my letter.
Can I borrow your dryer?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading him.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom's a Turk.
Can you remove from ten six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't need to do it.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
He's smart.
When are you leaving on vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There's no salt left.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I broke out in tears.
He talks like a truck driver.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he's not telling the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could imagine.
It's gonna be hard.
I want to be an actress.
When I was sick, Tom came and prepared me dinner.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
Seven is considered a lucky number.
Where are your dresses?
I can't say for sure what's going to happen.
Tom paid.
I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
I haven't worked since I got married.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a mare?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm kind of tired, too.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm in the loop now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like to play the piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.
I have to read.
I want you to stay.
What are you reading?
We're not happy.

Open your eyes.
We'll see.
Tom needs to stay.
I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
How about a drink?

No one encouraged him.
He dreamed he was kissing him.
What's the title of your new book?
We have each other.

Please repeat what I say.
The library's on the left.
Are you awake?
Where do you speak French?
You know you're getting old when you have to explain to a Greek who Melina Mercouri was.
Who cares?
Tell me which one you want.
First God
I know your older brother quite well.
He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?
Is he Japanese?
Tell Tom I went fishing.
All right, try again.

All the visitors are gone.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I'd been born Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't participate in the conversation.
Note: In English and we make the nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril; it's nice to meet you!
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's asleep.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sami peeed and pooped in Lyla's toilet.
When I grow up, I'll be a pilot.

You made the same mistake again.
Kate never celebrates her birthday almost ever.
How much do you want to get paid?
Aren't you happy?
Forgive Tom.

It's exactly what you need right now.
I did some research.
Are you tired?
It's still shallow, isn't it?
I left for London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid to lose your money?
It's cold, why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Get me a glass.
I need more money.
Everyone speaks French to them.
Whenever I hear this song, Tom comes to mind.
We've been running circles for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not illiterate.
I'm eating.
Your friend's here.
I'm over thirty.
Don't put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, admit it, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
Makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?

I'm very shy.
I love my country.
We entered a serious debate.
They've come.
I guess someone likes Tom.
You're going to visit me?
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to."
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the celebration.
As the phone rang, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary wore her best dress.
Tom's undecided.
Tom can speak both French and English.
Tom predicted Mary would do that.
I can't leave.
I'm an agnostic.
He wants to know how to cook.
I'll start with a tomato soup...
I need you.
Are you all right?

You're younger than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.

Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thanks.
Only I can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom owed Mary money.

Tom, I'm afraid we'll get in trouble.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.

Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I get drunk at least once a month.
I want to have some cheese.

Answer the question.
The problem is, you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I missed the last two lessons.

You're very attractive.
Come in, please.

Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is very small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everyone started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's a good theory, the only drawback I think it has is probably common to all philosophical theories.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm so mad now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of trouble here.
Who saw you?
She's bigger than she is.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the highest of three.
You asked them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I assume you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.
Is Tom going to die?

I want soup.
I beg your pardon?
Where did you get the key?
Could that not be right?
Tom can't stand the hot and wet summers here, and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, call me tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.

Thank you.
Are you awake?

Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of mushrooms.

Where can I buy tickets?
I was so hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I pretended I was asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary's sceptical about strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk slower.
Put the book on the others.
The bird's in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married a Canadian girl.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Are you texting them?

We only have three options.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom snores.
Do not turn off the light.

Thank you, you're fantastic.
Will Israel attack Iran?
I like to laugh.

He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father's rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll make up my mind.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
French isn't hard.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
It's always repeating the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Stephen's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
How long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay real estate.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a story.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father's gone.
I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's never been to Okinawa before.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus ride isn't boring.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first I couldn't understand it.

Tell her I don't want to go.
I saw her take it.
I like sports.
I have money.
I was waiting for you at 2:30.
I don't think it's good for you to go out with him.
I won't tell anyone about you.
Tom sang some old songs.
Whose pen is that?
Marcos is not as tall as Marios.
I'm very satisfied with your results.
I've seen worse.

I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
That's right.
We're being honest.
I woke up at five.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Who taught you French?
Tom had a black cat.
I'll buy one.
Tom would never have done that.
Tom lit three candles.
We're gonna get killed.
Are you texting him?

He's bald, isn't he?
What are you having today?

Why don't you tell them?
Is he asleep?
Where's school?
I'm not interested in politics.

I'm so tired.
What do you want me to do?
Do you understand them?
Tom's never used the Internet.
When did you start using contact lenses?

Wait a minute, please.
I can't forget her smile.
Today I'm going home.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in town.
I've had a tough year.

Tell her why.
You're not thirty.
Because I hate you.
I love Leanne.

We want meat.
When was the last time you did something for the first time? Think about it.
I'm staying.

Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
Here we are all Canadians.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's cooking.
I was scared.
It's better to teach someone how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I see.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.

Where does he live?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.

Bring them with you.
Give me your money.

Wait a minute.
Tom's gonna get Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?

When's your birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be specified later.
Nobody's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.
I'm thirty years old.

I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I understand.
If you can follow me, please.
He started talking to the dog.
They all ran out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's futile.
Tell them it's important.
The party's on Sunday.
Here we are all Canadians.
Here's how he snores.
Tom sent you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How is that word pronounced?
He saved me.
I got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get drunk.
I'm waiting for your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom's got black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.

Look what I've done!
Tom's a Harvard graduate.
You have 30 days.
Tom bought Mary a little gift.
The Russian language is a Slavic language, spoken as a parent in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which constituted the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm older than her.
Why don't you call them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm twenty-three years old."
Boil some water.
I wish I'd been born Canadian.

My parents live a strange life in the country.
He lost all his money at the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good look.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Thomas cursed me.
We're too busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your order the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car is dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.

I think they're only going to Australia to have fun.
Tom's cheeks are blushing.
I'm Richard.
What did you open him up with?
Would you like a booking a trip to Australia?

Tom will understand.
Where did he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.

Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We're well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to put me to bed, don't you?
Is it raining?
He's too slippery.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I think he's my friend.
What were you doing there?
The time will come when you'll know.
I'll eat it.

It was weird.
No one understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than she is.
Let me make my position clearer.

We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm texting them.

You bought a new house.
You never cared about me.
The thief disguised himself as a cop.
Can I get you out of the way?

It's going to be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?

It's very fun listening to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is short, although the smile only lasts one second.
Now I know the truth.
