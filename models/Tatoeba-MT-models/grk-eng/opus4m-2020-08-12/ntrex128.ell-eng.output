Welsh MPs are worried that they'll be confused with the muppets.
Some Members expressed their concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern has arisen in connection with the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that "it would end up with the words Twp and Pwp".
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "bad" and the word "pwp" means "pains".
A Pleid MP stated that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said its own party was "open-minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word "MWP" is not far from the word "mappet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire in U.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drawing up the bill establishing the name change, said: 'The final decision regarding any name to be called Members will of course be a matter of Members themselves'.
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the parliament as a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission voted in favour of the name 'Member of the Welsh Parliament' or WMP, but it is the choice of MWP that was given greater support in the public consultation.
Members are obviously proposing alternatives, but trying to reach a consensus can be a difficult matter for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the bill on changing the name within the next few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the way the parliament operates, including rules on deductions from the MEP's office and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the legislation.
Macedonian citizens come to the polls about the country's change of name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people were asked to vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbour hides territorial aspirations and has repeatedly opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, Macedonian president, a referendum war over changing the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change is merely the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been silenced as the churches in Harlem disappear
"The older people I spoke to, say that earlier there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of them."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounge where people often hang out."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the competent people hope "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
The congregations, he added, can be replaced by flats filled with people who will not be willing to help the areas of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said," and so they will rush the day that all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all those people who will move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became black metropolis - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church left in the 1930s.
A black congregation within walking distance took possession of the building.
Occupation of the St. Martin building took over a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the 125th Street stores, a key commercial street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners took over the reconstruction and ordered the carigon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, proudly called the carigon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carloon in July described it a little differently: "cultural treasure" and "replaced instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany Inn, from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carigon in the world played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carigon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweather said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has happened in recent months to St. Martin is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been hired by the church’s popular leaders, while others from the bishop.
Commissioners - the parish's governing body, made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter in July about their concerns that the bishop's bishop 'would seek to transfer the costs' to the College of Commissioners, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark attack on 13-year-old diving for lobsters in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during scuba diving for lobster fishing in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensigna.
Chad Hammel told San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of the child asking for help and approaching by rowing with a group to get it out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just screams of enthusiasm for catching lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
The whole key had opened to him," Hammel noticed when he arrived where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water, "There's a shark in the sea!" Hammel added.
The boy was airborne at the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Lifeguard Larry Giles stated in the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to be of any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim brought serious injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities have banned access to the beach from Pontus Bis in Casablanto to Swamish in Ensinite for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans put pressure on the UK's cosmetics market
Sainsbury's are measured with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams placing cosmetic shelves respectively with those of the department stores, staffed with specialists.
As part of the significant rise in the UK cosmetics market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sales of clothing and household articles fall, the largest shelves of cosmetics will be placed in 11 shops throughout the country and spread to more shops if the project succeeds.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets search for a way to make up for the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetic supply to 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space with shelves with the company logo, similar to those of the stores like Boots.
The supermarket is reopening its own Boutique makeup series so that most products are vegan - something younger and younger consumers are increasingly calling for.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to sell its products to two Sainsbury's shops, one that opened in Crewdon, South London, last week and the other to Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the tendency to buy small quantities of food daily in local minimarkets means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Coop, managing director of Sainsbury's, said outlets would be increasingly like supermarkets, as supermarket chains try to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more non-food services.
Sainsbury's put outlets in hundreds of stores, and also imported some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported sales of grocery stores and made the takeovers more profitable.
The last attempt of the supermarket to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments resulted in failure.
The Sainsbury's tried a consortium with the Boots in the early 2000s, but the co-operation ended after a dispute over how to allocate profits from the pharmacy stores in the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold the pharmacy company with 281 shops in Celesio, a owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £ 125 million, three years ago.
He stated that Lloyds would play its own role in the project, adding an expanded range of luxury companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the appearance and sense of our seams in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained personnel who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies is designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and the comfortable locations mean that we are now a strong destination for cosmetics which challenges the traditional way of buying".
Peter Jones: mad after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the 11 million-dollar deal.
The protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is furious after telegrapher Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the £11 million deal with his lifestyle business, in order to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business was likened to the Goop company of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of the show "This Morning", announced to Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoughby mad at the protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute in order to focus on its new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden girl on TV admitted during a meeting of tensions on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that because of her new contracts - £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to give the clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company was likened to the Goop company of Gwyneth Paltrow and appears to have doubled Willoughby's estate estimated to be £11 million.
After Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was going to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his country houses.
According to some source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was its long-term future, its source of revenue for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a storeroom full of products at the headquarters in Marlows ready to be sold."
Experts estimate that the departure of the broadcaster "This Morning", which is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost millions to the company due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing, as well as further delays in its presentation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband have been in close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52 year old Jones joined as president in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones keeps a 40 - percent stake in Baldwin TV companies.
Willoughby is going to become the main person in M&S's campaigns and replace Ad McPartlin in the presentation of the show "I'm A Celebrity" in ITV.
A source from Jones' narrow environment said last night, "We would not like to comment on his business affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media of a comment that some would consider to be inappropriate to a president, as well as his attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said imitating the style of a remote presenter.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Rai Young-Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "compatible response" from the US after North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he stressed, the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at putting pressure on it.
Trump held a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We almost had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we've built this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim yielded positive results - ending missile tests, release of hostages and returning the rest of the American soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his unusual attitude in statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a presidential look, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweeping an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their path
In the wake of the earthquake in Lobok, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental organisations would not be required.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the Lobok population was displaced, there was no national disaster, an essential condition for the exploitation of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international aid, therefore it is quite difficult," said Mrs Soubung.
While the Save the Children organization is preparing a team that will travel to the Palos, it is not even certain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national natural disaster service, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute assistance.
Given the earthquakes that often hit Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared to nature's anger.
While shelters for tsunami have been built in Ace, the same is not true on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in the Palo, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make administrative care even more complicated.
A floating hospital that had parked in Lobok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to the Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Windo had the centre of his election campaign to improve Indonesia's deorganised infrastructure and he made money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding hits Mr. Jocco's administration before the re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from the persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight the streets, using knifes, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Stirge is equal to Chelsea
Daniel Strange saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a goal of 89th on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Steritz accepted all of Serdan Sakhiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's finish with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and shot in the rear beam.
His effort was very high from the big area and he ended up right up in the nets.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arizampalaga who jumped to repulse it and got into the net.
"I was trying to take this place, get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Stiritz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Canteen approaching, I made a direct rotation, I didn't think much about it, and I did the shot."
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead after the goal at the 25th minute by Belgian star Enden Azar.
The blue aggressor gave Mateo Kovacic a heel in this game before giving a head shot near the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic made one or two in the center of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defensive and finished sending the ball to the nets in the back beam with a left shot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight against Naples in the Champions League group phase at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The tragic tsunami death record in Indonesia amounts to 832
The report of deaths following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832, according to statements by the country's natural disaster service early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the debris of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-point earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created 6-metre-high waves, the agency spokesman Sutopo Puroo Nugrocho said at a press conference.
The town of Palos, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect after murder of a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was discovered in Birkenhead, Mercyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Muse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the residents who saw or heard something to testify to the police.
Captain Brian Ohagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity around John Street and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the dashcam camera footage to communicate with us as they may have in possession of information that is vital to our investigation.
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and found herself in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they might know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse, in his attempt to return to his apartment, has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants have been informed that it may take hours before they are allowed to return home.
A policeman is allegedly telling a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with tears on stage.
He kept repeating, "It's horrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in the police ribbon and one outside.
Policemen were standing outside the ribbon watching the block.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 for case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the quarrel about "rewriting history"
His extremism would be poetic justice for the taliban destruction of many England's cultural and religious works by its fanatical puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Creek's proposal as "unbelievable" and "effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "In this debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's form would not be targeted outside Westminster Palace.
The iconoclast of England’s civil wars was neither dictated nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the acts of the ancestor of Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamos Thornicroft is characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe is worthy of tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is an entirely precise matter is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century shaped the later development of our nation and Cromwell is an identifiable personality that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also praiseworthy and memorable."
Killer Pig Injures deadly Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose last name was announced "Wan", was found with a cut artery in a blood lake near a pigsty on the Ljupansue market in the province of Gwitshou, South China, announced by Morning Post on Sunday.
An employee in a pigsty is preparing to carry out vaccines in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Zining, Kinhai Province, China.
He was supposed to have travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighboring pigsty.
He stated that there was a large - body male pig with blood in his mouth.
The coroner’s examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crooked," Guyang's news report quoted cousin as saying.
The security camera footage shows Wan entering the market at 4,40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wan or his cousin.
One market officer stated in the evening news that the pig has been placed in a cage in order not to attack anyone else, while the police collected the evidence at the attack scene.
The Wan family and market authorities are allegedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 295 kg threw a farmer into Wales on his tractor until the farmer’s wife terrified the animal to get away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was ravaged by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "guilt".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Remnants Rosa are going to bring extensive rainfall to the South West USA
According to forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as he moves over the coldest water masses of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rainfall to North Mexico and South-Western USA in the next few days.
The wind power of Hurricane Rosa reached 85 mph, consisting of Hurricane Category 1 at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and to move eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical humidity northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfall in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in combination with the approaching low wind pressure area will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2,5 to 10 cm rains will cause dangerous floods, flooding flows and possibly desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates close to 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains 5 to 10 cm high are expected locally in the Southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Floods are likely with rapid deterioration of phenomena due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended to avoid any walk in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rainfall can turn the gorges into rushing rivers and storms will cause locally heavy winds and sands.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally strong rainfall locally on the South California coastline.
A total rainfall height of more than 1 cm is likely, which can cause small flows of debris and slippage on the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropics will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early morning hours on Monday, before the phenomena spread slowly on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfall will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed throughout the United States as the Arctic temperatures fall, but in the tropical zones they remain quite high.
Sometimes, this leads to very intense changes in temperature over short distances.
A characteristic example of the intense temperature differences between central United States was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and re-expanded.
In much of Central and Eastern USA, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 °C from the east plains to parts in the southeast.
Temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast of the weather, there is a good chance of temperatures above the average in the East until the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers attended Bret Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million viewers watched the conscientious testimony of the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavanaugh on Thursday and the woman accused him of sexual assault, which reportedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blazey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with the television networks interrupting the normal flow of the program to overthrow the last minute on Friday: the agreement by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that she was 100 percent sure that at a party while Kavanaugh was a high school student, Kavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk and attempted to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a charged statement, said he was 100 percent certain that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen's measurements, more than 20.4 million viewers were likely to be heard on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The figures did not immediately become available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers watching a transmission from office spaces.
Let's see this viewing in its right dimensions, this is a common similar size to the one that attends a playoff football match or the Oscar award ceremony.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was preceded by an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
In second place, ABC is located with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS followed with 3.1 million, the NBC with 2.44 million, the MSNBC with 2.89 million and the CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became a protagonist in Friday's drama.
After his statement of moderate Republican vote in favour of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters disapprove of him as he tried to enter the elevator for the hearing by the Senate Justice Commission.
He stood by looking low for several minutes as they deplored him, live on TV at CNN.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think she's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say at the hearing with the Commission.
All cable and transmission networks covered live hours later, the vote of the Senate Justice Committee on the promotion of Cavanaugh's candidacy in Senate plenary for vote.
However, Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded after talks with his friend, Senator of the Democratic Party, Chris Kuns.
After discussions with Kuns and some other Senators, Flake then ruled out.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather votes for Kavanaugh's approval without an investigation.
President Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of EU withdrawal plans of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the newspaper's headline, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson strongly criticises the Checkers Plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal to collect duties between Britain and the EU was 'extremely absurd'.
Wade Simms Shot: Police arrested Suspect Deeton Simpson for killing the player in LSU
Police arrested a suspect in the murderous shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old player of the LSU basketball team.
Ditton Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained in prison on second-degree murder charges, according to Baton Rouge police station.
Authorities have a video of Simms' and Simpson's collusion, and according to the police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police tracked the glasses at the crime scene and said they tracked traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB co-operating with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said they admitted that he killed Wade deadly.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of the Eastern Baton Rouge coroner released on Friday, cause of death is the bullet wound to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a task force, the police forensic lab, the South University police forces and citizens of the region to assist in the arrest investigation.
The sports director of LSU Joy Allava thanked the local law enforcement authorities for "serious investigation and pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
Forward of 1.98 meters raised Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Basketball Team Whide said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
"We're always worried about incidents like this," said Wade.
Volcanic ash emissions in Mexico City
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popocatepetle volcano reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicons on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater reached its peak, recording 183 emissions of gases and ash within 24 hours.
The Centre followed various readings and small earthquake vibrations.
Social media images show car windshield covered with thin layers of ashes in Mexico City neighborhoods like Sochimilko.
The geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of size of 7,1 was in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces are colliding with Catalan separatists ahead of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protests in favour of independence with order recovery units were arrested, as thousands participated in the demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote on the secession of Catalonia that caused polarisation.
A group of masked protesters in favour of independence, held by the order's rehabilitation units, launched eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets usually flooded by tourists.
Conflicts also occurred later during the day with policemen using their clubs to suppress conflicts.
For hours teams of Catalan independence supporters shouted the motto "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of protesters in favour of the unity of the country shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized by minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region supporting independence one year after the referendum of 1 October was declared illegal by Madrid, but it is celebrated by the separatists Catalans.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, although the turnout was low with those against independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year, after police attempts to stop voting in the polling centres in the region where violent clashes occurred.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest took place but had to take a different turn.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the protests in favour of independence with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia's prospects to gain independence.
"We lived one of our brightest moments last year.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant," he said.
Despite having won a vital victory although limited in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties in favour of independence fought to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their most well-known leaders having exiled themselves or being detained pending their trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Pooch, a 42-year-old engineer, who recorded on his cell phone the protests in favour of the police, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is escalating more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Orioll Zunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were imprisoned last year, announced his candidate in the European elections for next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and oppression that we have accepted from the Spanish Government," he said.
Lodonteri: Arrest of Man After Car Residence
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash in London.
The incident unfolded in Bolinagard Cressen on Thursday about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
There may have been a shot in the car sometime.
Menga's strike gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goals for Livingstone ensured victory.
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerard his second defeat in 18 games as an agent of the Improx group.
Dolly Menga's blow made a difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Himberrian in second place.
Gerard's team remains without a win outside the championship this season and faces the Harts, who have the eight-point lead next Sunday.
Before this race, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna at Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has meanwhile continued its race in six games in her class, with main coach Holt still not having been beaten since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities towards visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before it scores, with its immediacy putting the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson got a lead and he almost got there before the finish, but Alan Lithgow kicked off his effort by slipping Craig Halckett's head off the finish.
The hosts willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could push visitors into free beatings and corners.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Rangers couldn't stop a free blow, and Livingston opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from downtown.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball's possession, but they found the defense of the hostages impenetrable, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This figure continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos repelled the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was repelled by the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and all of Lithgow's outfit came out on another Livingstone hit.
There were many vertical passes in the Livingston area and they were constantly refuted, and two penalty marks were requested - after Halckett claimed the ball against Glen Midleton's substitute player and one for hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alasder Lamont from Scotland's BBC on the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
spectacular performances and results for Livingston.
All of them were exceptional, beyond expectations in this upward course.
The game style and their personality changed slightly after they returned to top form, but the credits should also be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halkett was excellent, enlisting an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrell alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the contrary, didn't have any inspiration.
No matter how good they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they didn't respond to these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once they managed to cross the defense of the fieldmen and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed emotions at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the Turkish and German Heads of State for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to restore relations with NATO allies.
They had broken in relation to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police ruled out the concentration of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom have Kurdish origins - have also given the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish-Germans as a hero and others as a dictator.
Road accident in Detfort: death of a biker after collision with a car
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Detfort, to the southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a biker, who lost his life on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are trying to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisoners: Six Police Officers Injured in Conflicts · Global Voices
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in the highest security men's prisons, according to statements made by the Department of Prisons.
Trouble broke out in His Majesty Long Lartin prison in Worstershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still under way.
Tornado special police forces have been recruited to deal with the riots, involving eight prisoners and manifested in one ward.
The police were hospitalized with minor injuries to the face during the clashes.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel have undertaken to deal with the incident in His Majesty Long Lartin's prison.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may serve a greater sentence."
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, are being detained in His Majesty Long Lartin's prison.
In June, the prison administration was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October of last year, order recovery units were called in to suppress serious incidents that broke out during which staff members were attacked with balls of billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the areas with drought may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but it is possible that this will happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa remains will cross the southwestern parts of the desert, bringing floods into their path.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where he will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service indicated in its tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or low barometric condition less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict a precipitation of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in Mologon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest, including the Central Rocky Mountains and Grat Basin, rains of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rain volumes of up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk from floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the area is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern States are currently experiencing drought.
According to the US Drought Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought," said Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining hurricane intensity, Sunday morning Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenenia, Mexico, with maximum winds 85 miles an hour and moving north at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to reach land in Mexico with tropical storm intensity on the afternoon or Monday night.
There may be severe rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation volumes of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to north-west Sonora are expected, which are likely to reach up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and will reach the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected from Hurricane Rosa or its residues is the very heavy rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the Southwest States of the USA," the US National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous intense flooding and torrents of mud in the deserts and landslides in mountainous soils.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted homicide
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects of attempted homicide after detecting a 16-year-old who brought knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terror around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police are calling for anyone who may have recorded on their cell phone what happened.
Trump says Cavanaugh "experienced the hardship and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics," Trump said at a gathering in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh "experienced the hardship and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of showing up as a candidate.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, definitely denying and clearly touching Christine Blazey Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also filed a hearing on its allegations.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, quality and courage of Cavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent public service path," he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the candidacy of Cavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually it's like I'm a candidate," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction mission".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Cavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, CNN was told a senior assistant of the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is projected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were carried away by the giant waves that swept the coast, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, the authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palos on Friday, when waves of six meters high hit the land at night, luring many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
"When the threat to tsunami occurred yesterday, the world was still on the beach and did not run immediately, when it was hit by it," said Sutupo Pourwo Nugrech, a representative of Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency, in an update to Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, lured cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land," Nugrocho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palos.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster response service show many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's BPP said in a statement that the energy released from Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb that fell in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have enlarged the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugrech described the damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He said that a number of victims were found trapped under the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugrochus said that victims and damages may be greater along the coastline of 300 km north of the Palos, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
The communication systems "was completely paralyzed and there is no information" by Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
A broad criticism was made of the Office on Saturday because he did not inform that a tsunami had hit the Palo, although according to officials the waves had reached the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, there is a man on the top floor of a building yelling panic trying to warn people down on the road about the tsunami coming.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, luring houses and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large power outage, which also interrupted communications in the wider area of the Palos, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army started sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the displaced still need desperate food and other key types of emergency.
The city airport has only been reopened to contribute to relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Windo's visit to the evacuation centers in Palos on Sunday has been scheduled.
The victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to arrive safely in the city of Palos, where workers found shelter in accommodation from moussamades set up in the courtyard of their office, they went through disaster scenes along the way, said Mr.Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief teams have undertaken the sad task of starting the process of relief for those affected, some complain that foreigners, particularly experienced workers in the field of assistance, were not allowed to travel to the Palais.
Under the Indonesian regulations, the flow of financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be started if the location of a disaster is declared a zone of national destruction.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a countrywide disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says this is a national disaster, we can ask for international assistance, but there is no decision yet."
As the second day of the Palos after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday passed, friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less blemish.
On Saturday, a little boy was recovered from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman trapped under debris for two days next to her mother's dead body.
Genton Subadon, coach of Indonesia's national parachute team, had trained two of the missing parachutes for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Maddhaji, were his students.
"As an older sporter on the parachute, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Genton told how, when news was released about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the parachute community, he began sending desperate messages of WhatsApp to his opponents at the Palos festival who participated in the beach festival.
However, the indication next to his messages was a grey symbol "n", instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves extracted $26,750 during the refueling of an automatic take-off machine in Newport de Levi.
Friday morning, thieves extracted $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport de Levi, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver had evacuated an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the announcement.
While he was busy, another man "comes running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the point, according to the announcement, but the police did not determine the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity should contact the Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Canay West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Saturday, he wrote: "The being officially known as Canyah West."
West, 41, has long been listening to the petty son and used this nickname as a title in his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Arianna Grande on the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Besides being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word is of religious significance to him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means 'you'," West said earlier this year, in a discussion about his album title with radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name is changed from Canyon, which means "the only one," to Son, which is just a reflection of good, evil, of our confused self, of all.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
It's one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Shin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Paff Dundy, P. Dide or Dide, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brather Love.
A former West partner, JEI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name in or without dash and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president swears he won't use the army against civilians
Mexican-elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military violence against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelko Plaza Saturday that "he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left student movements were gaining roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, states the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment is to be added to communications from various parts of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence as a whole.
Meanwhile, China presented last year its plan to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence issues by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all other countries fall so far short of the US and we seek to make the next important discovery in the area of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement taking place in the US in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American Othell player, and later was an executive member of Microsoft Research and president of the Google appendix in China.
Lee acknowledged the importance of previous US government technology contests, such as the Robotic Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Plans Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would be conducted to identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get state subsidies, Li said.
"It's not China that gets the best of academic space, it's the companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired universities authorities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in migration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think a green card should be offered automatically to doctoral holders in artificial intelligence," he said.
The China State Council issued a Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies respectively share money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will include partners from business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made for months in US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian citizens are holding a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The Macedonian people participated in a referendum Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's candidate for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether participation will reach the 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece'.
The name-change advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that Macedonian young people can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so all our lives will be safer," Oliver Georgievska, 79, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Elections Committee said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, participation reached only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when it gave the present 66 per cent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko voted in the referendum on a change in the country's name that would pave the way for the country's membership of NATO and the European Union in the city of Strumica in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, the referendum will be between 30 and 43 per cent of voters, which is below the required participation.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be a success, participation must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy, since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Auero passes Brighton's entire defense to score goals
Sergio Auero and Rahim Sterling finished Brighton's defense by winning 2-0 for Manchester City Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Auero seemed to score easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine aggressor received all in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He went through three of Brighton's defenses before he got out in the open.
Then Auero was found surrounded by four green players.
He shuddered one defensive, then escaping several others at the edge of Brighton's big area.
Then he took a pass to his left, finding Sterling.
English Forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Auerro, who used his right foot to defeat the goalkeeper of Brighton Matthew Ryan, scored on the right side of the nets.
"Auero has some problems with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the battle of Premier League.
This goal came to the 29th minute.
Auerro took the ball deep into Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and guided Sterling towards the rear beam.
The blue fort kicked the ball in the net just before it got out.
City faces Hoffenheim at the Champions League groups on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rain-Necar Arena Stadium in Sinseim, Germany.
Serzer wants to beat the Rockies.
As the Nationals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the always antagonistic Serzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockys, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockys on the play-offs, as they precede a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the National League West.
The Rockies have gone to the playoffs with their five-two win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first place in their category.
"Although we have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and the other team will be a game probably of the highest level I'm facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight a race like that?"
The Nationals haven't announced yet who's going to be the original thrower on Sunday, but they're supposed to be inclined to let Serzer throw the ball.
Serzer, who will make his 34th start, did coaching shots on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a day of rest for him.
Washington's right-handed man has a performance of 18-7 with an average profitable point (ERA) of 2,53 and 300 out due to a strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump talks in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh, in a speech on the importance of the Republicans' participation in the intervening elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
This is a very important moment, and I am not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am, and that's why I'm traveling everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: "You see this lousy, wretched radical group of Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they're determined to take power back using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to eliminate to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have undertaken a 'resistance and obstruction' mission.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "angered and mean, miserable and lying."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Committee by name mentioning Senator Diane Finestein, a report accepted with strong approval by the public.
"Remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
This was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
I was not surprised by the fact that activists of the Momentum movement in my local group voted to bring reproach to me.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom they have said that they are not welcome, precisely because we are giving our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because he has resolutely resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticised because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, paradoxically, for similar issues to those for which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation".
During most of the eight years of being a local Labour MEP, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday evening were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, it is not this tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'more merciful, more compassionate' policy has long been forgotten if it ever really began to be implemented.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views began to wait for me to turn 180 degrees and to adopt opinions with which I would never agree, be it national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I spoke in public, regardless of what I was really saying, I listened to a snooze on social media, where people asked for my rejection, renounced the centre's policy and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every motion of censure or change in the selection rules, the party's limits are narrow.
I've been advised not to stand up for two years, not to speak much and that everything will be okay.
But I didn't get into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the Thatcher government, which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my aim was to defend better public services for those who need them most, whether as a member of the local council or as a government minister.
I never hid my policy and I did the same in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way with my political views and my disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who put forward the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is faced with a Brexit that will hit our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, indeed, my only message is not addressed to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political feasibility will prevent me from acting as I believe it is in the best interests of all of you.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: Invincible Air climbs to the top
Two late goals may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there's no doubt that Ire deserved to triumph in this highly recreational today's tenned championship race.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only invincible group out of ten.
Eventually, it was its superior defense, as well as the best exploitation of the opportunities, which raised the scale for the domestics, and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ire, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, with Frasier Climo converting, brought Air forward, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughs, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage, and Jason Bagott noted a goal that was unconverted.
Climo increased Ire's lead with a penalty before scored, right in half, a goal with conversion, leading Ire to the locker room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Bagot's turn, reduced the lead to five degrees.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury of Rurid Nott, who was removed by stretcher, and, after rebooting, Ire increased the difference with a goal by Staffford McDowaal, with Climo converted.
Deputy Chief Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose re-exploited the numerical advantage with Bruce Colvin's goal without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The hosts came back, however, and, when Strwan Hutchinson got a yellow taclyn card on Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a goal at the back of the attack launched by Ire.
Clima carried out a conversion, as he almost did since the reboot, after Kylie Rowe picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent Extrem Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the fieldmen.
Protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in focus
The protagonist of the Stell Game Ford Kiernan shows ready to move to the catering industry, after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the popular BBC show, which he's been writing, and he's been co-ordinating with his partner for years in Greg Hebfell's comedy.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle would be the last of the show, and it looks like Kirnan's planning his life after Gaygland.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although Scottish Sun's source implied that Kiernan wanted to deal with the "prosperous catering industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia enclosed hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol the Navy's fully equipped headquarters at La Paz.
The public buildings are flying blue flags.
At the bases of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is the slogan: "Our sea is rightfully owned.
It is our duty to take her back."
Throughout the Bolivia coastline, the memory of Chile's coastline after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the yearning of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have emerged today more than ever, for decades now, as Bolivia awaits the ICJ ruling on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and naturally awaits the result with a positive look," said Roberto Calzadila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the international court's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim to force Chile, after decades of unstable talks, to negotiate for Bolivia to be given a dominant exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native President of Bolivia, who is fighting a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of territories and it has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice is to be extradited only six months after the presentation of the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's goals, the last four years may have undermined them.
"The current Bolivia government has usurped the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted all remaining good moods in Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velje, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court ruling procedure was unusually rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to inaugurate a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end up disputes 139 years with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin American's most popular leaders, is using the issue of exiting the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea states there won't be nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
It called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the Heads of State of the two States.
Ri made these comments while US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems ready to resume nuclear diplomacy that had come to a standstill three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Yong Eun.
Ri states that the view that the continued sanctions and US refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will eventually force the North to kneel is a dream of summer night.
Washington hesitates to agree to issuing the relevant declaration if Pyonyang does not first make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and the American president, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is broad scepticism about whether Pyonyang is seriously thinking of renouncing an arsenal that the country regards as probably the only means to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyonyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trub summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in super-sized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to raise the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented on the pass a series of weird super-size hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that stole the performance at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the pass.
The part that was distinguished from Valentine was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide bucket of wings that completely covered the heads of the models.
Among other super-sized accessories there were watermelons decorated with gems, a wizard hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to high - sewing fashion.
One creation brought in mind complete diving equipment with respirator and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach main commercial streets near you.
The super-sized hats made their appearance very quick after the "La Bomba", the black hat with the too wide we have seen wearing so many, from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The popular firm that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent another great creation to the passarella, a flawless beach bag almost as big as the model that carries it in his swimsuit.
The dark orange shelve bag, decorated with shelves and a white leather handle, was the track that stood out from Jacquemus Spring-Summer 2019 La Riviera Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous stylist, Luke Armitage, stated in the FEMAIL column: "I expect to see big hats and big beach bags in the shopping shops next summer, as the designer made such a great sense that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for super-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the people of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a prehistory of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with a number of excellent results in the exams, which were only further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are struggling to provide their students and parents with the best possible level of service.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and highest levels of education, the professional career they will choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum on demand, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable lesson in choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, then what you say goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say enters into his heart."
This is a strong reminder of the fact that we cannot just rely on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's examinations, we find that the languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students studying foreign languages achieved degrees in graduation A.
Data gathered by 74 schools of SCIS showed that 72 percent of the pupils achieved degree degrees in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also had degrees A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, today, as a selection course, are considered as important as courses in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
Survey of the UK Employment and Skills Committee in 2014 revealed that, with regard to the reasons why employers had difficulty in filling job vacancies, 17 per cent of them concerned a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require linguistic knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill that you can use throughout your life.
If anyone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov survey in more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language to speak a two-digit percentage of respondents (15 per cent).
For this reason, investment in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, particularly the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find jobs with meaning.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK in 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland provide with devotion a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future holds them up.
One cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scottish youth.
They have to.
John Edward is director of Scottish Independent School Councils.
Lebron will debut the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting for fans looking forward to seeing Lebron make his first appearance with Los Angeles Lakers almost came to an end.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first game before the Denver Nuggets racing season in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is probably gonna play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six-game program that the Lakers have to give before the racing season.
"I don't need to get ready at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's concentration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of gatherings starting in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump gatherings next week, which includes tours in friendly adjacent areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his choice for the Supreme Court standing by, Trump seeks to strengthen popular support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch her online?
Trump's gathering in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's concentration in West Virginia online below through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week's hearings about the candidate for the post in the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanaugh, who were held in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a Senate confirmation vote that has been pending for up to one week while the FBI's investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help Republicans facing a dubious outcome to the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign staff said these five gatherings next week are intended to "mobilise volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and extend their majority voting in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so crucial for his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible as we are heading for the busy period of the campaign," he told Reuters a representative of Trump's campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned evening gathering in Wesbanco Arena, Willing, could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to the newspaper West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month Trump visits West Virginia, the state that won by far over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump's trying to help Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who's down in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the polls," Reuters quoted Simon Hender as saying.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the courage to fight keeping hopes alive as it marches on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon's quarters may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillation of momentum is a completely invented sporting idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such confrontations.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were ahead of six degrees, and now they're ahead of four, so I guess we have a little momentum," Jordan Spath said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of precedenting four degrees and of remaining twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air in their sails" and have a lot to encourage them, such as the twin Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of the four.
Spith was deadly from the tee to the green and set an example.
The voices of the celebrations became stronger as he continued his round, achieving a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit with which they won the game on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations showing their conviction that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside and worry about your own game," Speath said.
It's what each player has left.
18 holes to make history.
The only players with more ranks than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin of Europe has achieved four in four, and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
Mollywood was the only twin that didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoid bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way energy seems to flow to and from noisy spectators, seals the fact that they are the players who will have to win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the Fourball Breakfast, when he played with Alex Norren.
With a bogey and two double on front nine they tied the Spaniard and the Swede so deeply into a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourball and foursome are so exciting matches to watch them closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they give, the tips they don't give and how a strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this course has also shown that the US team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its head start in fourball and Saturday foursome with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired twin of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari has been charging two victories against a contestant Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National until now at four degrees.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to maintain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the miserable American side in the fourball breakfasts, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted more on the foursomes, winning two races, but they couldn't catch up.
Jim Furik's side needs eight points from the 12 single races on Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win a four-point series, and along with Molinari, also known as Mollywood, after a shocking weekend is just the second twin to win four points in the first four races in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson DeSambo with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged into the two Saturday matches, has occasional brightness explosions, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven rows.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the fourball mornings, returned to Henry Stenson's teammate for the foursome with 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka, winning first and third place in the world rankings.
It has not all worked out for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spath and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two degrees on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win against John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and came back later to defeat Poulter and Rory Mailroy 4&3 in the foursomes while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's story a team was able to recover while losing at four degrees in singles, though because it is the tropes, Furik only succeeded in a tie to keep the trophy in place.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is out of the question.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence measures
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen the feeling of distrust towards the US and that his country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the World Organisation's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" in the past year, e.g. the interruption of nuclear and ballistic tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally start our disarmament."
While Ri reiterated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "stage" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea will be rewarded as it progresses gradually in the process, its statement was important in that it did not completely exclude unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyonyang did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint communiqué of Kim Yong Eun and Donald Trump at the first summit that took place between an current US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyonyang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on "first denuclearisation" and increase pressure by threatening to achieve their cause by blackmailing, even putting obstacles to "war ending statement," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can kneel us is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US chief pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, the denumeration of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the US inland with North Korea's ballistic missiles was inevitable because the "Poor President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, knitted Kim's praise for his courage to go ahead with disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timetable for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyonyang for the measures it has taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday, however, that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until complete, final and confirmed decommissioning is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to neutralise the funding of Pyonyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyonyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not gone well.
He left Pyonyang in July saying progress had been made to denounce him by North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take "respective measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he seeks were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and promotes normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking lessons on how to get a lot of rest
This year, a new lesson at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing range of cultures of the whole night study with the consumption of a lot of caffeine.
An academic found out that students at number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, e.g. how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the lesson after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came and said to me, "Why am I just learning about this now, in my last year?"
He said no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as to improving general prosperity.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, stated that the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were deprived of sleep during the week to a significant extent.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive work.
In one section there is the image of a student dormitory, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of routine sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not directly change student behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chisler.
The culture of pride because you've been studying it all night, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a problem that is growing.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and stress, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation, resulting in a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californiaian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chisler design the course, having attended one of his ranks last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson in the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar program before starting their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler recommended students to regulate a alert for the time they should go to bed, as well as an alarm clock for the wake-up time, and to know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disintegrate the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores Gerard's men.
The Rangers suffered one more sad defeat off the ground, as Dolly Menga's shot led to Steven Gerard's decoordinated side of a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Improx's team wanted to make its first win from February to 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's only second defeat in 18 games as coach, leaving the team eight points behind Harts, the first to rank the Ladbrokes Championship.
Menga hit seven minutes before the Rangers' half-time and inspiring roster seemed incapable of returning.
While Rangers is now in sixth place, Livingston goes up third, with just a goal of precedent Himpernian.
And Rangers may be waiting for more trouble, as Superintendent Callum Spence had to get first aid for head injury caused by an object thrown out of the platform.
Gerard made eight changes in the team composition and detonated Eyre to the semifinals for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Livi 11" composition that got a grade from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well-trained machine of his was able to suffocate each other's efforts.
Rangers may have dominated the occupation, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first faraway pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the media didn't find the ball.
A deep kygan jakobs shot found Chief Craig Halckett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow was all he could do was send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have won a 15 minutes penalty as he clashed with Steven Loles, but referee Steven Thompson ignored Colombian complaints.
Rangers had only two shots within the area in the first half, but Improx's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not worried at all about Lasana Kulibali's head and the subtonic shot of Ovi Ejaria.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race Livvie was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Still, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained his temper and found Menga who just finished the effort.
Gerard made half-time changes by taking Kulibali out and putting Ryan Kent in. The change almost immediately, as extremist paid the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure the guests to the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Halket moving one faraway ball after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt by the Corner.
Rangers' deputy, Glenn Middleton, had another shot at the end, as he clashed with Jacobs, but again, Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
A page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882: today, 136 years ago and BALE ... the day in Germany was born the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radiation, and this invention eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger counter.
Pillar of science since then, meter Geiger passed into the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive metal elements such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of people caused by radioactivity in metal elements."
Evans: "Look, it's crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name continues its work.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" the problem cells
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" the problem cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify problem cells in the treatment framework
The method includes the export of immunocells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and then reinfused
One vaccine being tested presents promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the problem cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immunocells from the patient, modifying them to the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor J. Berzovski, from the US National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, stated: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzovski explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach in which immunocells are exported by patients and then "teached" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanie West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the MAGA slogan, after he appeared on the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanie West disapproved of the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a foreign interview in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again (Make America great again), he gave a delight recital against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and he says, "But how do you like Trump?" He's a racist."
If racism were to worry me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch that Matt Damon was starring, with Hollywood's star encroaching on Bret Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on Christine Blazy Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, West's delirium video came up on social media from comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to poke West with this post.
Also, West protested to the public that they didn't treat him well behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They busted me in the backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
They bowled me!
And they say I don't know what's going on," according to the Washington Examiner.
I'm gonna put on the superman cape, 'cause nobody's gonna be able to tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were dismayed at least twice by the public, and the SNL players seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety said, with one person saying in the magazine: "In the entire studio there was death silence."
West was called as a replacement for the last minute of singer Arianna Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Rapper McMillar had died a few days earlier.
West got a lot confused when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative group, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: We thank you for meeting the Crowd."
However, the broadcaster, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "self and that's great."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe embodies and essays ideology which is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the being previously known as Canyah West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and he follows in Dide's footsteps, also known as Paf Dandy, Puffy and P. Dide.
Rapper Snoop Dog had changed his name to Snoop Lyon and of course the legend of music Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Know As Prince.
Category of assassination attempted at a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was charged with an attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.

The charges will be investigated by the D.A.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harrington Criticizes Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as swordsman John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However, the actress, 31 years old, criticizes the stereotype of a bunch of hero, saying that such roles on the screen pass to young boys the message that they should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something goes wrong" and wondered how to combat the problem of toxic masculinity in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star at Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has a "strong view" on the subject.
"Personally now, I believe very much, where did we make the mistake of masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up about the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the male characters he promotes.
He continued: "What is inborn and what is being taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they should behave like this to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our youngsters."
In the interview he also admitted that he did not intend to play at any of Game of Thrones' prequels or sequels, after the end of the series next summer, saying "the end of battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will be starring at the revival of Sam Shepard's True West project, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with his wife Rose is the best thing he got from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in a row, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose pretended to be Hygrit, John Snow's love resentment, the character Kit is playing in the Emily Award-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 to Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China Reports 14% Increase in New Events · Global Voices
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were some 40,000 new cases reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse, signalling a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus was spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of individuals infected with HIV in this way was almost zeroed, as Chinese health officials had said at a conference in Yunan province.
However, compared to last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a very serious issue for the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourses with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines in the context of an attempt to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters is lying about leaking data from Republican senators, condemning "hazardous lies" and conspiracy theories.
This Saturday, US Spokesman Maxine Waters disproved claims that a member of her staff published personal information from three Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
Democratic deputies in Los Angeles argued that the claims were being promoted by commentators and websites on the "extreme right".
"Lies, lies and even more horrible lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The reported information is reported to include the residence addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been released by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during a hearing with the Senate commission on allegations of sexual offenses against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill said.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie," Waters continued.
"My staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false claims, were in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Flaiser.
"This denial is full of anger, Flaiser wrote.
"This shows that he doesn't have the courage to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't be presumptuous.
He must not question the motives of the one who blames him.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Flaiser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic critique of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of looking very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to dethrone Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," tweet.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false claims".
"We will do everything we can to find those responsible," he continued, "and to account for all their deeds that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff."
Critic of the film Johnny English Reruns - a subtonic spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It's a tradition to look for Brexit's marks in every new film with a British character and that seems to be true in this revival of the Franchise action- comedy film with a hero of Johnny Inglis, which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and came back in 2011 with the film Johnny English: The Return.
Can this humorous self-sacrifice on how obviously a mess we are to make the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Inglis, with the rounded eyes, was able to renew his licence to mess them up for the second time. His name states that it is a wider comedy creation designed for non-English-speaking film viewers.
It is, of course, the unmasked secret agent who, while pretending to have the glow and ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouse, with a dose of "Mr. Bin" and something from the guy who played a single note on the musical theme of the film The Fire Roads at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man once played by Atkinson in Barclaycard's most forgotten television ads, soaking chaos in his path.
There are one or two good moments in this last JE movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingliss approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, humor is quite subtonic and curiously paradoxical, especially when "serious" film franchise like 007 and Dangerous Missions now include several comedy elements.
Humor seems to be directed to children and not to adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny Inglis' crazy setbacks are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's silent movie sketch for Bin's Persian.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyber-hacker has penetrated the British super-secret online spy network, bringing to the fore the identity of all British agents on a mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, who is being played by Kevin Eldon in a sadly small role for his axes.
It is the last drop for an ambitious and ambitious prime minister on the brink of a collapse due to political anti-populationism: Emma Thompson is doing the best she can with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not really help her.
Intelligence advisers inform her that, as any active spy has been revealed, it will have to restore someone decommissioned.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who now works as a headmaster at some aristocratic school, but gives informal lessons for undercover agents: here are some nice scenes, as Inglis offers a press espionage academy A School Very Rock.
Ingliss is returning to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reuniting with Buff's former and suffering partner, who Ben Miller is playing again.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin of His Majesty's Secret Service are returning to action, meeting the beautiful and fatal Benefits of Buletova, which Olga Kirilenko plays.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fascinated by the charismatic billionaire of technology who claims can solve Britain's technological suffering: the threatening Jason Volta, which Jake Lacey impersonates.
Inglis and Buff start the odyssey of their farce: disguised as waiters, set fire to a large French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to board the luxury yacht of the Volta, and Inglis causes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to get acquainted with the interior of his house.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as adorable and fussy as it is, it keeps reminiscent of a little childhood TV.
Moderate things.
And as with the other movies Johnny English I wonder: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role in which he will really be enchanting with his talent?
Workers deny that they consider a plan to work the British for four days, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days' work.
The party is reportedly seeking to channel the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the employees, giving them an extra free day.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend without a reduction in their wages.
Sources say the idea goes hand in hand with the economic agenda and the party's plans to turn the scales for workers.
The change in a four-day week was approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
Higher source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow government secretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "faced directors" and the "profit-makers" to the utilities.
The shadow government's plans also mean that today's shareholders in the water companies may not get their entire share back, as a potential Labour government could make 'withholding' due to suspected irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on the boards of directors of companies and to create mutual funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual dividends of up to £500 a year.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking on the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday, Scott Peley, correspondent on the 60 Minutes show, asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, "Did you?"
He was unmovable, determined, unmovable."
However, Graham's vote seems to be not going to change.
"I have decided on Bret Cavanaugh and he will need some explosive charge to change his mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
"And anyone who has named can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also a equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are scheduled to flow to the Great Lawn of Central Park under the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardey Bee and Sean Men, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting against it.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as reporting volunteers, sending an email to a global leader, calling or finding other essential ways to contribute to awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert the right way for our fellow citizens to be persuaded to take action or is it just another case of so-called "climaticism" when people feel they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" than its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which is going to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and executives, who have undertaken "to help children fully exploit their potential", promising to give Rwanda $35m to eliminate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community such as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is aimed at 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In answer to the question, "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" included in the web site's frequent questions,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great human rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are united more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Mendes, Cardie Bee and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the Navy to "block" by blocking Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can turn "if necessary" to its Navy in order to prevent Russian energy being marketed, including the Middle East, as US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where he attempts at invitation by the legitimate government, is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he reported.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the possibility, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group characterised as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the USA.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the utilization and replacement of fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "pony that knows only one bay", as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as Trump's administration has undertaken the task of strengthening US gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the administration of Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a captive.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude caused Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kebv, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider a candidate for the Presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would seriously consider a candidate for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
At a meeting at the City Hall of Holocaust, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our problematic government, and that's why she needs a woman at the top," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will consider a candidate for the presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he "driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't chew on her words about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a Surfolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% were in favour of such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other popular names from the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible candidacy for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would have formally decided by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Trak Palin's Post-traumatic Strike Disorder at the Donald Trump gathering.
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
Arrested and accused of domestic violence Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since his return, I can understand other families living with the consequences of the Post-traumatic Strike Disorder and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return home," he told the public in the context of a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pailin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that "return a little different, return harder, come back wondering if there is respect for what soldiers, airmen and any other member of the army have done for the country."
Arrested Monday in Wales, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference with a report of domestic violence and gun possession while in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Washila police department.
18 states and the Columbia region support the question of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum for victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted an amicus curiae report on Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to question politics, NBC News said.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Cesion action filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" abused her, however, US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
He was detained in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries that are severely affected by gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Committee (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General of Columbia District, Karl Rasin, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring entire decades of state, federal and international law".
"According to federal law, all asylum requests should be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application; such an impediment infringes this principle," when reporting amicus curiae.
Lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy that refuses entry to immigrants harms the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "be a necessary workforce".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Cesion ordered the judges of immigration cases no longer to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape situations of domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," Cesion said in his statement of 11 June on politics.
The aim of asylum was never to relieve all the problems (even the most serious) faced by people every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue the Old, as the number of dead doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly deteriorating.
"It is very intense," said the 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her fever-free baby at an evacuation centre set up in the destroyed town of Palos.
"Every minute the ambulances bring other bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Some residents tried to return to their damaged homes and collect their belongings through water, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 - scale earthquake were unable to meet the needs.
Some wounded, such as Dui Harris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, remained outside the Palais Army Hospital, where the first aid was given to the countryside due to continued strong aftershocks.
Tears flooded his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake to shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel sharing with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the debris of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper in favor of mutual commercial benefits between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to disperse his propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid insert that appeared in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to get involved in the elections in Congress on November 6, a charge China refuses.
Trump's accusation that Beijing attempted to interfere in the US elections signalled what US officials told Reuters was a new phase of the escalating campaign that Washington has launched to put pressure on China.
Although it is not forbidden for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war and have imposed reciprocal import duties.
China's tariff retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was aimed at hitting exporters in states such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstadt, US Ambassador to China and former governor of long-term Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstad wrote in an opinion article in Sunday Des Moines Register, "indulges in this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"In an effort to disperse this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the precious tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America, posting a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at Beijing stands, you will find few divergent voices and no true representation of the differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic path, given that the media are under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided offering to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which one.
Republicans alienate female voters in the run-up to the mid-term elections because of the fiasco with Kavanas, analysts warn
As many leading Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh in spite of allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, in the next mid-term elections.
Feelings on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be remedied," said Grand Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, about an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute move (R-Arizona) to seek an investigation from the FBI will be enough to attract the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will certainly not forget it in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted the slogan "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as the Republicans who control the Judiciary gave the green light to Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr Christine Blazy Ford's testimony, Mic said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach a record level," said Stu Rodenberg, an unbreakable political analyst, on the news website.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of indecisive female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old who, while dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony that detailedly described her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had predicted that there could be a reaction if the Republicans proceeded with the anointing.
"It is a huge mess for the Republican Party," NBC News quoted Michael Still as saying.
"It's not just about voting in committee or about the final vote or about whether Kavanaugh is going to be put out of the game. It's about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated it," Guy Cecile, director of the Priorities USA team, who helps elect the Democrats, pointed out on a news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Fortn and Kavanaugh, slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said that she surely or probably believed Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his statement, while just 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Last week Ford swore before the Senate Court that Cavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals while they were at a party when they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Burners Lee, the inventor of the World Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new spirit of this technology is Inrupt, a company based on the Berners Lee's open Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work pending lists, calendar, library music and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all of this at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal electronic data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this possibility "personal data empowerment".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berner Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted programmers who worked on the project and a community of code programmers.
Since this week, world-wide technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners Lee said that he and his team are not talking to " Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overthrowing business models overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a media post released on Saturday, Burners Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the new tissue created on the basis of the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berner Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Burners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Burners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next Internet era," Burners Lee added.
Bernard Van: A tribute to a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church who has received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Lt-Col Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday there was the revelation of a commemorative plaque by his two grandsons, accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the revelations of the plaque were made just 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Van led his battalion to Saint Kenteen's canal in the middle of a very thick fog and was under heavy fire from combat weapons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "excellent bravery" led the line forward, before hitting himself with a battle gun three from the posse.
Lt Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic deeds were "something I know I could never reach is something that makes you feel unlimited respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a wreath after the parade led by the philharmonic young Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great honour involved in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a genuine hero is evidenced by the support he has of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching the Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Pig.
Think of this scenario: you have stayed up all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but they deprive you of the pleasure of seeing this unique sporting event.
The San José program included 13 matches, including six on main card, and would be screened live in the United Kingdom, by Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mussashi and Rory McDonald were about to go out in the ring, viewers in the United Kingdom stayed together when the show changed in Peppa the Goon.
Some were not at all happy as they were awake by the early morning hours especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described the projection of the childcare program as "some sort of sick joke".
"According to the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the child's program had to be promoted," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the Pig, indeed."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cocker, said they were going to process the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think of the riddles, I think we can make it," Koker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our own time, which is Monday's.
But we're trying to.
Believe me, when the change took place, many messages were exchanged back and forth and were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you, next time, this is not going to happen.
We'll limit it to five races instead of six, as we usually do.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympiacos in scuba diving, Tom Daley, said that he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, this prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school that he wasn't all like me.
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she supported homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he's been less interested in a win at the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the well-known radio show, was on leave for several months because of illness.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me strength and will to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympiacos is a pointless defender of the rights of the LGBTK community and took advantage of its participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to move on with the decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said "it was a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar-winning Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, but claimed that the age difference was never a matter.
"When you spend so much at such a young age" (he first participated in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it is difficult to find a peer who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said he changed his whole perspective.
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "Daddy, you won't be around us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was now dead I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley played the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was everything I dreamed of all my life, fighting at the diving at the Olympic Games in my country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which inspired him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and even brought him shivering.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of form Mickelson will sit on the counter on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th race at the Ryder Cup, but he will need to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in the races held every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furick to sit on the bench for the fourballs and Saturdays.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as usual for the United States, the five-time winner shared the day with the lines to "work" his game hoping to correct his troubled points.
Without ever having been the most straightforward driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old's game is not suitable for the narrow court of Le Golf National, where the distant ones are often problematic.
And as if the challenge of the stadium, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth race, was facing Francesco Molinari, British Open champion, who works with newcomer Tommy Flitwood to win all four of their races this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mickelson's game may be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he plays today, hit me friendlyly on the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's very confident.
His name is in Hall of Fame and he has offered too much to these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't calculate him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we should go.
He wants to go out there like everyone else."
Mickelson's record will be overrun by Nick Faldo for most Sunday matches at the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that didn't reach the height of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furick said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spirity, likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players also had fun teasing him this week. It was funny to see it.
His contribution isn't just in the game."
European team leader Thomas Bearn knows that the big lead can be lost soon
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great head start from the last day's singles to the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into defeat.
Danus debuted in the 1997 Valderama game, where a team led by Seve Balester was able to gain a five-point advantage over the Americans, but just after he managed to cross the final line with a breast difference, earning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderama, where we won, but barely," Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and leading 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the members of the team that this isn't over.
We're going all set tomorrow to give it all away.
We'll go out there and play right.
Nothing's over until you see the grades on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know very well that there are equally good players in the other team – the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Biorn adds: "I wouldn't be in a hurry to prejudge the outcome.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow counts atomic performance, and that's something different.
It's great to be on the field with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then you try your best skills as a golf player.
This is the message you have to pass on to players, how to get their best out tomorrow.
You leave behind your teammate and he has to give it all up and show himself the best."
Unlike Biorn, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to perform better atomic performance than they had with their teammates, except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of the four.
Furick himself has experienced both ends of the last day's overturns, as he belonged to the winning team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every word of his rheumatism," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader in 1999, had rallyed his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the middle fights.
We decide our turn accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has undertaken to lead the race and faces Rory Makilroy at the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it covers the whole route," Biorn said justifying his singles choices.
New deferral for Germany's new warship
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been on duty in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War era, but it will not be received by at least next year, due to defective systems and inflated costs, local media report.
The service of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which calls for a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with tradition have been decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
They will carry a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some Stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are the reduction of the frequency of maintenance work, as it will be possible to use new frigates for up to two years other than German ports.
However, continuous delays mean that although warships are considered as the latest technology, they will enable Germany to show its strength abroad until they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate became front page last year, when the German Navy officially refused to pick up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Not much information has been known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have mentioned a number of important "defects with software and material" that would put the warship in use if used on a battle mission.
Software problems were particularly important. As Baden-Wuertemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 seafarers, only half compared to the oldest Bremen class frigates.
Also, it has been revealed that the ship has much more weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have twice the weight of ships of similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the costs of the whole project (including crew training) were also a matter of concern.
It is said that it reached the trumpeted figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion euros), while the initial budget was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the new frigates are particularly important since Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions".
The official said that the problem was growing over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdroppes the secret life of bats
A new survey conducted on a farm in Highlands, Scotland, seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when chasing their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the planning of future environmental protection actions.
The study by Scots scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanny bat and small bat, as well as Dobenton's brown bat and mystery in Inverewe Gardens, in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile searches using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of bat calls, as well as which species have this behavior.
Then, a map of the habitat and a report will be created in order to form a detailed picture of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Duar, a natural protection adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by every species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biotopes management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have fallen significantly since last century.
They are threatened by building and development projects affecting the parts where they mourn and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced audio-location technique to detect insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers bats to be very important.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, inspect the places where bats are tired and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created the first and only refuge in Scotland for bats on the Treave estate, in Dampris and Galloway, where eight out of the ten kinds of bats in Scotland live.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, states that the estate is the perfect ground for bats.
"Here in Three we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and an ideal habitat.
There is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what is needed to increase their populations."
It stresses the importance of first checking for bats before any house maintenance work, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and young ones, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them or disturb their peace or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said: "There is a lot left to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we simply do not know how their population develops."
Ronalto denies rape complaints as his lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine
Christiano Ronalto described the allegations of rape against him as "fake news," saying that some "want to project themselves" taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
National Portugal and Juventus aggressor is accused of raped an American woman named Katherine Mayorga in the room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
According to the complaint, she allegedly paid $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronalto, 33, described the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is make news," the five-time winner of the Golden Ball on the camera said.
"They want to project themselves and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but this is part of my job.
I'm happy and all is well," the player added smiling.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to sue the Der Spiegel for the allegations they published, which they described as "unacceptable rumours of touching privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skertch said the player would demand compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The supposed incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronalto and Mayorga returned to the player’s room, where they allegedly raped her rather than nature according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronalto fell on his knees after the supposed incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy," but betrayed the other "one percent".
Documents say that Ronalto admits they had sexual intercourse, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to overthrow the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome because of the alleged incident.
Ronalto was on the brink of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Union at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus to secure an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will Forever Repent" Loss of Automotive Industry · Global Voices
The UK "will always regret" if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain abandons the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry stated that the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, where the models Auris and Avenues of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Managing Director in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has stated that it will close Mini's plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern the supply chain according to the automotive industries in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. The spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be border problems, resulting in delays and a lack of components according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold a stock beyond one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically trying to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement; we want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio's Today Show 4.
"The data coming not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that the continuity of supply chains must necessarily be ensured."
Toyota was unable to say how much pit would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the extra cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and who is the union leader of the unite at the factory, said that the members of the association are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, the White House announces
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein can "delay yet another week" as the dispute continues on the candidate at the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian intervention in the elections, Trump's assistant links with Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Trump's potential to fire Deputy Attorney General, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been feeding Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a bug in order to record his talks with Trump and allow the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House in the midst of reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate's Committee on Justice, Justice and Home Affairs to which both Cavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blazy Ford testified.
On Friday, Trump instructed the FBI to carry out an investigation within a week on the allegations against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the holding of a vote by the Senate's plenary.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokesman, appeared on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date is yet set, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week will be postponed, given all the other cases that concern the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, besides, I always like to inform the press."
Some journalists objected to this claim: Sanders has a press briefing in the White House since September 10.
Presentator Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the updates was not due to disdain for television journalists' "impression" movements, although she said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being displayed."
He then made it clear that he would increase or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The President gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting, "we looked at these numbers."
Updates will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the press can ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is incomparably better than talking to me.
We are trying to apply it often and you have seen that we have often implemented it over the past few weeks and will take the place of press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Isolated press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled journalists.
The Health Minister sends a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System in the midst of fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU citizens employed in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and wish them to remain after the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.
Jin Freeman, a Scottish MP, wrote and less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of self-employed status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued and are on the way to anticipated decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also intensified preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Defender Christian Abercrobi was subjected to an emergency surgery following a head injury in Saturday's match, where Tennessee State Tigers scored 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, reported by the reporter Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reed's main coach told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half hour.
"He came to the counter and just collapsed there," Reid said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrobi oxygen on the bench and then put him on a stretcher and carried him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrobi was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no "even data on the type/expansion of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrobi, a second-year student under the "redshirt" regime, is in his first season at Tennessee State following his transfer from Illinois.
He made five taclins on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching 18 taclins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp charge for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher landmark fee in the UK, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the Tories' new plans.
The measure will counteract the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on non-tax buyers in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to UKL 120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will start a higher property tax in the UK, while the extra money will be used to help homeless people, as Teresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more economic housing and to target high wages.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on non-taxed natural and legal persons in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will strengthen the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, imposed on the current stamp fee, together with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and houses to be rented, may be at three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to yield up to USD 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by nonresidents in the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and making it more difficult to enter the real estate market.
Many rich regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is only introduced a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp fee, so that more young people can get their first residence.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices of real estate high, but acquiring land without using it and calling on Mrs May to remove the ceilings in economic housing in order to restore Britain's 'roofy shame'.
Mr Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on 'no fault' evictions.
He also wishes to give greater authority to the councils in order to build new homes.
Ms. May said: " Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And that means repairing the broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and foreign companies to buy homes as easily as hard-working British nationals.
For too many people the dream of housing ownership has become far away and the lack of housing remains undeclared."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train the Scottish team."
The head of Sanderland, Jack Ross, states that his "absolute ambition" is to be a coach at some point in the Scottish National Team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of resurrecting the Northeast England team, which is currently in third place in the United Kingdom League One, three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after bringing St. Miren back to the Scottish Championship last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that's it," Ross told Scotland's BBC on the Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a child, and that's something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I'm successful in training teams."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sanderland are Dick Advocat, David Moys, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette and Paulo DiCanio.
The former coach of Aloa Athletic reports that he was not awe-inspired when he was invited to succeed such well-established names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Can I bring this team back to Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it undoubtedly belongs to Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably think of myself as a success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period of time as an assistant coach in Dambarton and a period of 15 months in Hart's coaching staff.
Then he helped Aloa return from the downgrade to the third category and led St. Miren from the lip of the downgrade to the conquest of the Championship next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartpul, Folkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Acandemical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said, remembering the takeover of Aloa coach.
"I really thought it suited me more to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making decent money out of it, and I was pretty high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through trouble with the stress and the stress of the job, but my coach's work fits perfectly.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I've done it, I've been more comfortable than I've felt with myself all my adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30pm on Saturdays, research suggests.
Summer heat boosted profits for Britain's tested pubs but brought greater pressure to restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 per cent, as figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultancy firm, who collected the data, said: "The continuous sunshine and the larger of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern to last month, in June, where profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, but restaurants were hit even more.
The 1.8 percent reduction in restaurant revenues in June just worsened in July.
The alcohol - serving pubs and bars did better, with the corresponding figures from previous years rising more than the corresponding restaurant data dropped.
Food - serving pubs also suffered during sunny days, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM's leisure and hospitality analysts section, stated: "These results verify the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find themselves in difficulty, but the fall in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have appeared at a worse time for businessmen in the catering area and time will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a long-lasting extension."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade name launches.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sales index of Coffee Peach Tracker collects and analyses profitability data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of more than UK pounds and is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children keeps secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents
As the survey reveals, one in five children - even 11 years old - keep secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents and teachers
Research to 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages on Instagram
This news intensified fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a master account to show their parents.
One in five children - even 11 years old - create social media accounts that they secretly keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo release site.
This news intensified fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of the students said they maintain a healthy "principal" account to show their parents, while also keeping private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, spotted a teenage girl who urged others to rape her ("Hurry me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of School Managers and Directors (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are succumbing to the temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't locate them."
Eileen Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish track board
Eileen Doyle was elected as non-executive advisor to the Scottish Track Council at the annual general meeting of the management body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete, and President Ian Bitty commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eiling enjoys infinite respect for the entire Scottish, British and world track community, and we are sure that the track in Scotland will have a huge benefit from its entry into the council," Bitty said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischaemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether and whether I'm gonna recover.
It was debilitating, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am performing agility exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising a mammal who compares mothers to cows divides online public opinion
A mammal production company has divided online public opinion with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with milking cows.
In order to launch the so-called "universally first silent and wearing a breast-fed", the consumer technologies company Elvie released a humorous advertising inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom offered to suckling mothers by the new breast-feder.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and, "In case you don't notice, these are not breasts, they are my tits."
The choir continues: "Put it, pump it, feed it, feed it, pump it, pump it, milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 screenings and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take the milk industry seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their babies steal them a few days after birth," someone commented.

Someone else commented: "Obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise breasts for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended advertising, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "host-hearted".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a breast-fed if I still had to breast-feed.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I didn't sit down and overanalyze her.
It's a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump breast milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not about advertising that praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that they all danced with their distinctive breasts in their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who draw breast milk with their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Breast is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even go out during pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and Executive Director of Creatives in Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pool is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and challenging launch.
By making a parallel between suckling women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the pumping of breast milk and all the challenges it poses, while, at the same time, showing in a fun and correlated manner the incredible feeling of freedom that the new breastslaughter will bring.
It's not the first time that the Elvie buzzer has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared at the pass for fashion designer Marta Jakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants moved quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has risen, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the administration of Trump have made it more difficult to match children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters are themselves immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to come out and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was intensified in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential conservators and other adult members of their household should give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to support unaccompanied minors.
Later the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had a white criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of people who are either supporters or housekeepers are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr Albens.
In order to deal more quickly with the cases of children, the responsible people introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously applied, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, in the position of self-personal appearance, in order to develop their claims for legal status before the judge responsible for immigration.
Those who are judged not to meet the conditions for exemption will be expelled immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or distressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Counsel has said that these concerns are intensified in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely not to be perceived due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the scene without being given enough time to prepare children psychologically or say goodbye to their friends may aggravate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of others have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "give this sacred battle until we drive all Syrian terrorists away" by both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and inform both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of the war-ravaged country.
On the refugee issue, Mualem said that conditions are good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing irrational fears" that led refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarised zone in the last great bulwark of rebels in Idlib created the opportunity to promote political debates.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions would target jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaida Front Nusra, who "will be neutralized".
UN special envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new commission composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that interventions should not be made.
Because Trump's gonna win a second term.
With this in mind, Mr Trump will win the 2020 elections again, unless, as many liberal spectators hope, the motion of censure and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency finale of all time!"
So far, there's no evidence of the spectators' tiredness.
Since 2014, the viewing numbers in the high viewing band have more than doubled, reaching the CNN 1.05 million and almost tripled, reaching the MSNBC 1.6 million.
The Fox News network has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high viewing area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" show has scanned its viewing numbers on satellite television, with 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
It is a fire to which people are attracted because it is something we do not understand," said Neil Baer, producer of ABC's dramatic series "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack destroying the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, veteran script writer of comedy series and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the elections in 2016.
Her driver said he would vote for Mr Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"She answered, "Because she makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovel said.
You can have fun even with chaos.
Contrary to the TV series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy vs. Wade case if immigrant families can reunited the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of informed citizen when you're here for six hours watching a group of experts talking about using "very long background interviews" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", Paul Manafour's booter jacket of $15,000 ostrich leather ("a garment full of hybrid," according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the muddy descriptions made by Stormee Daniels about Mr Trump's anatomy.
Well, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What it does and that gives you the feeling of reality show is that it gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the TV program "Pawn Stars", about the constantly alternating actors and the daily overturns in Trump's plot (starts a fight with NewFL, praises Kim Young Eun).
You don't have the luxury of losing any episode, or you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flyce this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Kawai, but he was locked in watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not when Bret Cavanaugh was going to be in front of the Senate's Committee on Judiciary and the Supreme Court's future was hanging by a thread.
"I remember we did those crazy shows back in the day, and people said, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flyce said.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

External money flows to the limiting of the intervening elections
No wonder the 17th Pennsylvania constituency of Congress receives a flow of money, thanks to the reform of the congress's electoral districts, which set two current members of Congress for the same position.
This recently redesigned suburban region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another district in special elections held last spring.
Lamb has an opponent of another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the former 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which held in January that the old regions were being manipulated unconstitutionally for the benefit of the Republicans.
The election campaign in the new 17th constituency triggered a financial competition campaign between the parties' largest financial segments, the Committee on Democratic Campaign for Congress (DCCC) and the Committee on National Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a borderline in a special election campaign held in March, for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress, which many people attended.
This post was held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 degrees.
Political analysts give a light head start to democrats.
The United States considered that El Salvador would be punished for its support for China, but they were backed up by the United States.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and he maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Agency's administrative team.
State Department officials decided to revoke the American diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions no longer to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nawert, the agency's press spokesman.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to receive approximately USD 140 million as US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the country of Central America, with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As domestic meetings were evolving, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent refugees from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior management made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively ending the thoughts of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Penns is going to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance of the concentration for the administration, as diplomats said.
All three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by Special Adviser Robert Muller on blocking justice by Mr Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumoured that Mr Muller also turns his investigation into colluding between Mr Trump's election campaign and Russia with regard to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr Trump will be held accountable before this body, as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the next elections and perhaps finally before a sworn court.
'if' is too much and I do not imply that Mr Trump's fall, nor his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that we all have to make from both sides of the Atlantic to judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of massacre.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unreserved course of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now confronted with several of these turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he was written in that newspaper that last year he proposed that the president be recorded and considered him inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr Rosenstein said that the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
"How are we going to answer if the F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation into Bret Cavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the well-founded charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections on a congress that will put Mr Trump under account?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I took on the thing, I don't think we're gonna fail.
My mother was Czechoslovakian Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light the Jewish Saturday candles at that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior executive in Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turkish Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
The Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain with Vijareal earlier this month, will give her a lot of chance of being qualified by the 7th Europa League Group.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season to score 2-2 with Vijareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this effect as a trigger for bigger hits.
"It was a good time for us because Vijareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We got into the game thinking we could achieve something and came out with some degree.
Perhaps we could escape at the end, but, in general, the draw was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now Thursday is another great European night.
Well, we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have brought a good result to their last game, but, with people on the platform, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, due to my injuries and the changes made to the team itself, but there's a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids are enjoying it, training is good.
Let's hope we can do our best now, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women are losing their sleep because of their fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their husbands.
Only 10 percent said they have spoken about this to their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they are not taking the initiative to have the relevant debate," said Holly Schneider, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
Start with that.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options may be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your consultant may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy at a redemption price to help you cover these costs or self-security with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care proxy to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that health care professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to contact.
Also, consider making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on financial matters on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts are paid in case you become helpless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is en route to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter these details in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the financials, but who are the doctors?" Martin wondered.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan."

The victim, about 40 years of age, was in the Oxford Grove district of Ilfracobb in Devon County when he was shot in the chest, belly and arm.
Police described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Summer Time, as a "random event".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries he suffered are not life-threatening, and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palos on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications being interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have not been able to obtain information from Dongala, an area north of the Palos, which is closest to the 7.5 degrees of earthquake on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people in the Palou were removed after the outbreak of the disaster.
Here are some important elements relating to Palos and Dongala, on Sulawesi Island:
Pavlou is the capital of the province of Sulawazi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawazi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regentism, a tier of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main supports of the economy of the province of Sulawazi and in particular in the seaside region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it meets more in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Paul and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit Western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the earthquake-like Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Achech Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, while over half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead on the island of Nia, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees on the Richter scale hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees on the Richter scale, centred near the city of Pandang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale struck one of the islands of Medawi, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost approximately 300 people life.
2016: An earthquake of low focal depth hit the Pindi Jaya area in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as it brought memories to the world of the destruction that the deadly earthquake and the tsunami of 2004 sowed.
It wasn't a tsunami this time, but over 100 people were killed from falling buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's first-born son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin, from Wales, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, inhibition of a complaint of domestic violence and resistance against the authority, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known woman attempted to call the police to report the crimes she allegedly committed, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Pailin is temporarily detained at the Mat-Su temporary detention shop, with a guarantee of $500, as reported at the KTUU television station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "sure, innocent" when asked, as the network says.
Pailin faces charges of three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to imprisonment of up to a year and a financial penalty of $250,000.
He is also accused of a category A attack, punished by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that there's been criminal prosecution against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with charges of domestic violence, obstruction of a criminal offence against domestic violence and possession of a weapon while in a drunken state.
His partner claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, when she linked her son's violent behavior to a post-traumatic anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake on the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the central Sulawezi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating from the moment of the catastrophic incident.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a celebration on the beach in Palos, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the seldom imposed death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty to be imposed on Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that has killed eight people - a rare punishment to the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bicycle road along the West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, luring pedestrians and cyclists on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify the sentence to death, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "with intent" and caused serious physical harm "with intent", according to the declaration of intent to impose the death penalty, submitted to the South District Court in New York.
Both charges carry the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov up against the indictment of 22 points of charge, which included eight charges of homicide for a criminal organisation, a policy that is often applied by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and a charge of violence and destruction of automotive vehicles.
The attack required "important design and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov attacked as "abominable, cruel and vile."
"Saifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused pain, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nikolas Clives, An-Lore Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferucci, Ernan Diego Mendosa and Alejandro Damian Panuko," as stated in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District Court in New York has prosecuted a case that brings the death penalty.
The accused, Halind Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time that a death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 to husbands Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being conspired for conducting a spying in favour of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan citizen, seemed unrepentant in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He said to the investigators that he was satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to launch the attack by ISIS video he saw on his cell, according to the indictment.
He also asked to set up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to the police.
He's declared innocent of the 22 charges in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "supposedly disappointed" with the public prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting the declaration of guilt for life in prison with no possibility of release will simply prolong the trauma caused by events for all parties involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense group had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty.

Former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MEPs said he should be the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bonn told protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have gone out by now if Mr Farage were the Minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underlined by the fact that supporters of staying in the EU Toris participated in a separate protest gathering against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep under control the draft Checkers compromise in the midst of attacks by Brexit defenders of residence in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted on moving forward in their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and forcing Eurosceptics and Workers to choose between its package and the 'haos'.
Mr. Bone said at the Leve Means Leave (Retirement means Departure) in Solikhal that he wanted to fly "the Checkers Plan".
He said he should have been given a courtesy title to Mr Farage and given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would already be gone now," he said.
The MP from Wellingboro added: "I'll support Brexit but we need to drop the Checkers Plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bonn rejected the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The speculation that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay is completely untrue."
The pro-Brexit MP of the Toris Andrea Jenkins was also at the protest and told journalists: "I am just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checkers project does not accept the general public, Opposition will not vote for it, it does not accept our party and our activists who go down the streets, and after all they elect us.
Please leave the Checkers Plan and start listening."
With a sharp message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the protest gathering that politicians should be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get away with it if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the advocates of EU residence protested in Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
Few activists mixing Toris banners against Brexit after gathering the team this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with an application of the party at the start of the conference.
"They are the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Canada agreement with enrichment, for the uninterrupted borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
He didn't mean good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously consider running for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democratic Senator spoke of her future plans during a gathering at West Massachusetts city hall on Saturday.
Warren, often criticising President Donald Trump, claims her re-election in November, rival to Republican State Representative Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly assumed that it can be counted with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was her 36th meeting with voters using the city hall structures since the start of Trump's term.
One present at the gathering asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to build our broken government, and that means that a woman needs to be at the top.
Arrest for the LSU basketball player's deadly shooting Simms
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday, announced the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11pm (Eastern Time Zone).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man shown in the video.
20-year-old Simms was shot deadly in the vicinity of the University of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wade Simms suffered a bullet wound to his head that led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, according to website network 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in possession of a gun and confessed to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without resisting and is being detained in the Police Department of the East Baton Rouge district.
Third-year student Simms, 1,98, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, with 10 performances as the main player last season, with an average of 17,4 minutes, 5,6 points and 2,9 rebounds per match.
Gran Pree of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his team's instructions handed the victory over Sebastian Fetel
It became clear from the moment Valerie Botas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
At the starting point, Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, defending his position in the first two turns and calling on Fetel to attack his hostage.
Fetel first went to the pit and let Hamilton run on the race line, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit a round after and came back from Fetel, but Hamilton came out in front of a wheel-driven battle, which forced Ferrari's driver to reluctantly abandon the interior due to danger of falling into the breach of double motion to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstapen started at the last position and was seventh at the end of his first round on the 21st birthday.
He then remained first for a large part of the race, as he held his tires aiming to terminate quickly and pass in front of Kimi Ryconen in fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round, but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Ryconen came fourth.
It's been a long day because Valerie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did excellently and did one or two," Hamilton said.
Body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finestein at a sabbath gathering about her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blaze Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Committee on Justice, Justice and Home Affairs, commenting instead that the facts in the Senate proved that people are "bad and miserable and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate over the last few days, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and misappropriate and miserable and miserable," he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Finestein, did you do the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak," he added by imitating the senator.
Finestein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Cavanaugh in July and she leaked earlier in September - but Finestein refused that the leak was done by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," Finestein told the commission, as reported in the Hill paper.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret as she asked me."
But her refusal did not seem particularly to convince the president, who commented during Saturday's gathering: "I will tell you something, the body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president implied that Democrats are using charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
You see the malice, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get power and control," the president said on the news website Mediaite.
Elite Leig: Dadi Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants across Dante.
Dadi Stars got atonement for her defeat at Friday's Elite League match by Belfast Giants, winning the 5-3 rematch in Dadi on Saturday.
The Giants got an easy lead on two goals with a hit of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviyer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought a tie for the fieldmen before Dwyer took the Giants lead back.
François Bushar balanced for Dandy and then two goals by Lucas Ludwald Nilsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in Elite League during the season for Adam Kif's men, who came with a score of 2-1 on Dandy in Belfast Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the three previous races.
Dwayer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFall's assailant, while David Rutherford gave the credit thanks to which Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an inaugural period full of action, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquard gave his assailant to the balance from Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer got the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal for the evening towards the end of the first quarter.
The team of hosts was regrouped, and Bushar rebalanced with a power demonstration goal at 27:37.
Kaunny and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nilsen give Dandy the first time in the race towards the end of the second period, and he secured victory with his team's fifth goal in the midst of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost in four of the last five matches, are playing at their headquarters with Milton Caines in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of aircraft passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life in an attempt to secure the safe take-off of an airplane carried by hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing because of a large earthquake that hit the island of Sulawezi on Friday, causing tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in ruins in the city of Palos.
However, although his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonyus Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower that was ravaged at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Juffri Airport in the Palais.
He remained in position to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was in the take-off run at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Shiret said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News television network broadcasts.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballippan to Kalamantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palo.
"We are shocked at his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster response agency reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Shigi and Bhutong is limited.
"The number of dead is believed to increase further, as many bodies are still under the ruins, while many of them have not been able to reach them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Pourwo Nugrocho.
Waves that arrived at six meters destroyed the Palo, which will have a massive burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Riza Kouzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water's a little short.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesian President Joco Windo arrived in Paloon on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out any evacuation-related work.
Are you ready?" broadcast CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Airline Crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after an aircraft crash in a lake
The airline operating a flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports missing a man, while earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the immersed aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday afternoon she has been unable to find the tracks of a man passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to track down the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Vessels in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water as they tried to land at Chook Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and the situation of all of them was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought the plane passed the landing runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down pretty low.
"That's extremely good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others were able to move through the water that reached them as the middle of the emergency escape exits of the submerged plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicked and yelled and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a dock have also helped rescue using a inflatable boat to carry people to the shore before the ship was immersed at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in conflicts of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these conflicts involved Air Niugini.
Analyst cites the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The indictment authority concluded its speech on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlet testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
Explain to the jury how she used mobile phone records to set up 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlet said he received location records from various mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, disproved his previous claims, reported by Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's cell phone the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the accused authority asked him if Tellis was telling the truth he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense's going to start her speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he estimated that later that day the trial would be put at the jury's discretion.

The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent recovery in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy? !
Nanny in New York sues a couple who fired her after receiving a "racist" message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a message that the mother accidentally sent her where she complained that the nanny was "another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist, likened the treatment to extortion.
Linsey Plasco-Fluxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Morris was black, just appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"NOIIIIIIIII OTHER BLACK" wrote Ms. Plasco-Fluxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her blunder, the awkward Mrs. Plasco-Fluxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, had not done a good job at all and waited for a Filipino girl, according to the New York Post.
Mrs Morris received a reward for her one and only day's work and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs Morris brought an action against the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims a refund of about $350 a day for six-month working as an in-house nanny, for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told Post on Friday, and he added, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple opposes the allegations that they are racist, saying that it was reasonable to fire Morris as they feared that they would not be able to trust her again after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Likening the treatment to "extortion," Plasko said his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you be chasing someone in this situation?
It's not that nice," the bank investor added.
While the legal case is under way, the public court hastened to condemn the couple on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not be interested in a Teddy Teddy that speaks, as reveals a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who was reading it for the first time before his extradition.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who was working as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book from a yellow bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet-sweet" as her father left his life last year.
About Paddington, whom he describes as "a very important member of the family", added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington was so true in his eyes, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of it even if it's not your accomplishment in fact.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital Louis Paster 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and telling me it was too bad, that he didn't have much hope of doing it," said Mrs. Edna-Laperouse.
"Sometime Nant called me to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tsy, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowing down and getting out of her system.
He was already dead a while ago and at that time, and now everything's gone out.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have stayed calm."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who so far mourned for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who ignored the test she was going through.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I had my head down and tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I had a feeling of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women mourning the loss of their own persons hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are hanging on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and telephone numbers one can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him thanks to his smile.
They always said his smile was lighting up the room."
However, he left his job before he died, as "he was in a very bad state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after putting an end to his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying that there will be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or upset or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was down on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye."
He said his death caused a huge trauma to them, but they have to get over it: "He's breaking up the family.
It's crushing us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Bret Cavanaugh's future is uncertain, as the FBI starts researching
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a research of limited duration and limited object - perhaps we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the committee would be dissolved in the midst of established party impasses.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to carry out an investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The interim elections are in only five weeks' time, on November 6th and if, as expected, the Republicans are not doing well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to obtain the election of the person they want in the country's highest court.
George Walker Bush is calling senators, pushing them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Penns, the vice president, to get the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean apostates falls under Kim's authority
The number of apostates from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Yong Eun came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 distances last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges for traffickers were key factors.
Pyonyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of apostates from North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are escaping through China, which has the biggest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the apostate illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, typically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyonyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearisation, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Yong Eun in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to cooperate in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Ill accused American sanctions of lacking progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, under no circumstances will we disarm our country unilaterally first," said Rim in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozi calls Brett Cavanaugh "later," says she's inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Democratic Chair of the Nancy Pelozi House of Representatives called candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh "later" and said that he was inappropriately unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelozi made these comments on an interview Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman were to behave in this way, Pelozi would call it "later" about Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with great emotion, denied charges of having committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was deeply touched, sometimes almost shouting, and his voice shuddered as he spoke of his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats in the committee, declaring the accusations against him as "a monstrous and coordinated political murder of a character", organised by liberals who are angry at the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections of 2016.
Pelozi said she believes Cavanaugh's testimony proved that she cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed that she was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he ruled out himself by these statements and by the way he was achieved against Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozi reacted when she was asked whether she would try to make a reproach against Kavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, then he is not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is currently serving," Pelozi said.
Kavano is a judge at the District Court of Appeal of the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that as a Democratic concerned about Cavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or in the Roy vs. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions whether he would overthrow some Supreme Court rulings.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and wait for us to say "not wonderful?" Pelozi said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of wrath are overflowing, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem 45 years later told me.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say "he helped me a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And just keep going.
And it seemed great to me."
The tears are allowed as an outburst of rage partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of a job I used to do in an office where men dominated, is once I cried unspeakablely and was grabbed from the neck by an older woman - a cold manager that I always feared slightly - and pulled me into a ladder.
"Don't ever let them watch you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be happy because you've been smashed."
Patricia Schreeder, then a Democratic Senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidency campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a ship named Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for the presidency itself.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidacy.
Someone called the situation "The Snow and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already begun for some time now, it was back in funding and so he swore that he would not enter the election race if he hadn't raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
In her speech that she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was very heavily charged with emotions - thankful for the people who supported it, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives and anger with sexism - that she felt knot in the neck.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schröder about the press reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Has she cried?"
How the Trade War between the United States and China Can Do Good in Beijing · Global Voices
The greetings of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is too long to finish, a break between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
American President Donald Trump dropped the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exportable products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation has evolved this week, imposing new duties on US $200 million (150 million) valued items, in fact by taxing half of all the products imported into the USA from China.
Beijing always returns fire in kind, and recently imposed duties of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to return the American fire, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to put it down soon.
In order to make Washington retreat, it will have to give in to their demands, but pilgrimizing publicly in the US would be too embarrassing for Si Jinping, the president of China.
But according to experts, if Beijing is able to play its cards properly, American pressure in the context of the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hastily political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have admitted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused in Asia, at the Center for New American Security (Centre for a New American Security), a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for returning refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid for the reconstruction of the war destroyed by the seven-year (over) country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have been forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians left the country since the war broke out in 2011.

I'm so glad we got the cup back.
Everything is for the team and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said touched after European victory.

American leader Jim Farik spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At times this morning, we pressed for Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
