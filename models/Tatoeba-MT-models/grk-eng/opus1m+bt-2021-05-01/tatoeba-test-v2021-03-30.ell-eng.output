Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're way faster than I am.
Tom lives in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You look frustrated.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's the way it is.
We're laughing a lot.
Tell me what you'll get at the exams.
I think two languages are not enough.
Can I borrow your car for tonight?
Where did you put him exactly?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should talk to them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to the church by car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who stayed?
Where did you put it exactly?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's gonna be home at three o'clock.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to know French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish isn't my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student, Jutsu.
You'll see.
I'm not happy with that.
They're gone again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is she all right?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you work?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We've screwed the house green.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
The garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canadie.
Anything that shines isn't gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
My phone's ringing.
Throw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than I am.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was inside his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who is this?
Tom forgot his case on the train.
They killed our cows.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a commonpe with hippies.
The water's hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Kanade?
People today pay more attention to culture than to the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you put your hair down?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I go every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We might need some people.
That's a proposal.
How did you spend the vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Oh, do we have a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find it for you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who that is?
Did you see baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother on her phone.
I wanted to die.
He does the same thing to me whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not a matter of money.
Would you like to see them?
You destroyed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like people.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You're 18?
I want to make sport.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
Close the 40s.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain welcome us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her in love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
What do you call that?
Laurie's still at school.
My office is downtown.
He's got two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom wears gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks the French wrong.
I'm higher than you.
Have you lost proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm an arrogant.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news gave him a break.
We're enemies.
Who's got him?
We don't have anywhere to go.
How many blocks can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?
Tom's from Boston.
Tom drinks every day.
The cat's underneath the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't see any TV.
I'm the coach.
Tom will be working this afternoon.
Who is she?
Dined.
He convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the puzzles.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll watch you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom put the wall on pink.
We're too busy.
Harder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
Eat up!
Work hard.
I don't come here too often.
I'm gay.
You're easy to understand.
He's not a hero, Tom.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
That was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
You're learning Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.
Russia is great.
The teacher is friendly.
You destroyed her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for a long time.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
You can do nothing.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I did what I was sleeping.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
Snow has stirred up visibility.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom is a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now is your chance.
You can choose any book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom's not a Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
You thought I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I have not received an answer in my letter.
Can I borrow your pistol?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I read him.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is Turkish.
Can you take 10 out of six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
Tell her you'd like to go.
He's smart.
When are you going on vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There's no salt left.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I broke into tears.
He talks like a truck driver.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered it yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he's not telling the truth.
I don't agree with you.
Nobody could have imagined it.
It's gonna be hard.
I want to be an actress.
When I was sick, Tom came and made dinner for me.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
Seven is considered a lucky number.
Where are your dresses?
I can't tell for sure what's going to happen.
Tom paid.
I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
Ever since I got married, I haven't been working.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a belt?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm kind of tired, too.
You sure you don't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking late.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father a Japanese man?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm in the glove right now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like playing piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.
I have to read.
I want you to stay.
What do you read?
We're not happy.

Tell me the good news first.
You thought I was Canadian?
Tell them I'm ready.
I need a pen and paper.
Open your eyes.
We'll see.
Tom needs to stay.
I need to learn many foreign languages.
How about a drink?
And the Greeks eat fish.
They were cooperative.
No one encouraged him.
He dreamed he was kissing him.
What's the title of your new book?
We have each other.
He made the same mistake twice.

I saw him come out.
Tom will never let this happen.
Can you see me?

Welcome to the team.
Please repeat what I say.
The library's on the left.
Are you awake?
Where are you talking, French?
You know you're getting old when you have to explain to a Greek who Melina Mercury was.
Who cares?
Tell me what you want.
First God
I know your older brother quite well.
He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?
Is he Japanese?
Tell Tom I went fishing.
All right, try again.
Tom and Mary need help.
Kids seem scared.
Tom took his hat off.
I want to see the streets.
Which one of them is mine?
Algeria is relatively safe now.
Tom will help me.
You're very rich.
We didn't have tea.
All visitors are gone.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I had been born Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't participate in the conversation.
Be careful: In English and we rule the nationalities, the days of the week, and the languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Kirilus; I'm happy for the acquaintance!
He's got nice feet.
His present behaviour confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's sleeping.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Same peeed and fucked up in Lyla's toilet.
When I grow up, I'll be a pilot.
Do you have any sugar?
I went home.
Language is a living organism.

We laughed.
Take me with you.
I have to go to bed.
Both are alive.
They'll fix him.

Help me pick it up.

You made the same mistake again.
Kate doesn't celebrate her birthday almost never.
How much do you want to get paid?
Aren't you happy?
Forgive Tom.
Tom's a little smaller than your daughter.
It's exactly what you need right now.
I did some research.
Do you feel tired?
It's still shallow, isn't it?
I left for London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid of losing your money?
It's cold; why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
Birds are red.
Get me a glass.
I need more money.
They all speak French.
Whenever I hear this song comes to my mind, Tom.
We had circles for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not illiterate.
I'm eating.
Your friend is here.
I'm over thirty.
Don't put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, admit it, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where have you been yesterday?
Tom is John's brother.
Are you sure Tom can do that?
He's got a lot of money.
You better be honest with me, but I'll tell our mother.
The girls were looking at each other.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
I like running.
Same tells about your security.
I never eat meat.
Dimensions need not correspond to a natural quantity. Anything may be a accommodation space provided that the addition is defined between accommodations and the proliferation with a graded size.
His money's in the bank.
I'm so shy.
I love my country.
We're in a serious conversation.
They've come.
I think somebody likes Tom.
Will you visit me?
- Why don't you go?
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the feast.
As Tom hit the phone, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary put on her best dress.
Tom is unavoidable.
Tom can speak French and English.
Tom predicted Mary would do that.
I can't leave.
I'm an agnostic.
He wants to know how to cook.
I'll start with a tomato soup.
I need you.
Are you all right?
This book belongs to Paolo.
He doesn't seem to be Canadian Tom.
I don't understand French at all.
They'll repair him.
It's younger than your sister.
Give me the pepper, please.
My cousin is a journalist.
This animal is mine.
I wish I had been born Kanady.
I'll be ready on Monday.
Nine in the square equals eighty.
Can I try it?
You're way faster than me.
You're much smarter than me.

Who shot them?
He writes me less and less these days.
Give it up.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom pushed his nose to the window.
You're younger than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom believes Mary killed John.
I'll find them.
I arrived at 2:30.
You might be right.
Oxygen is necessary for combustion.
Everything okay?
You're unbelievable.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thanks.
Only I can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom owed Mary money.
Tom's not driving fast.
His present attitude confirms what we have guessed.
Tom told me he'd like to visit Boston.
Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
Harder.
Don't be so hard on your son.
Her question is very difficult to answer.
Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're alive.
You convinced me.
She's my daughter.
I was talking to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm shy.
We'll take a visit to our friends.
I'm in a lot of frequency.
And speaking of genocide, today is Columbus Day.
Same hired another maid.
I need some orange juice.
The entrance of the toilet is very dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to go now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our trouble.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not gonna reveal her secrets.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I'm at least once a month.
I want some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't seek that word in the dictionary, I don't know the Arab alphabet.
Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two lessons.
I'd like to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page ten.
This elevator is inoperative.
There were so many people in the room I could barely move.
He's going to visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom has blue eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have wine.
We've come first.
I'm smarter than him.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I was eating something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is too small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everybody started running.
When does Tom read?
We'll kill you.
You're too old to do it yourself.
- What would you like? - I'd like a dog.
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a nice theory, the only disadvantage that I think it's probably common to all philosophical theories.
Why don't I be surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very angry now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of fuss here.
Who saw you?
She's older than she is.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is continental.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
The language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike is the tallest of the three.
You asked them to wait?
He's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.
Is Tom going to die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain unanswered.
I like Irish music.
Give me a spoon.
What's your height?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a tough language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I should have had tea.

Mary's got too long hair.
I'm exhausted.
I know what her name is.

Lucky I met her at the store.
Tom's trying to learn French.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Don't you remember them?
I'm on my way.
Tell them I'll do it.
Do you have the source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
What?
Where'd you get the key?
Can that not be right?
Tom can't stand the warm and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, call me tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need a mike.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as his feet could take him.
I like fishing.
I don't like those candy.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.
Tom ate an orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.

Yes, sir.
It's true!
Can I use your phone?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of mushrooms.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was very hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I did what I was sleeping.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary's guarding with strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is difficult.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
This is where I live.
I hope you'll call back.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk slower.
Put the book on the others.
The bird's in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canadiana.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Can you send them a message?
Can I borrow a pencil?
We only have three choices.
The Moon is behind clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom snorts.
Do not erase the light.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously unhappy.
Aren't you a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom insisted.
Thank you, you're fantastic!
Is Israel attacking Iran?
I like laughing.
I was washing my shirt.
We'll talk later.
Eating slower will help you feel more grass.
I'm French.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
I got up early yesterday.
Tom helps Mary.
It will protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father's rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
French isn't hard.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
He's all repeating the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language are they talking in Switzerland?
Help me pick him up.
They're Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
And how long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay real estate.
That's a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before nighttime.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a rumour.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father's gone.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's never been to Okinawa before.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus ride isn't boring.
Who sold Tom's car?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first I couldn't figure it out.
I'm talking, Esperado.
California's boring.
I'm happy!
All of them are Canadian.
You're not welcome.
She's a very beautiful girl.
He's helping him.
Nothing's missing.
He started singing.
That's a menu.
I wasn't drunk.
She wants you to kiss her.
Tom was here a minute ago.
I had a rough day.
His mother speaks Italian.
I'll give her a tip.
Where are the girls?
You won't be alone.
Tell her I don't want to go.
I saw her take it.
I like sports.
I have money.
I was waiting for you at 2:30.
I don't think it's good for you to go out with him.
I won't tell anyone about you.
Tom sang some old songs.
Who's that pen?
Mark is not as tall as Marios.
I'm very pleased with your results.
I've seen worse.
I wish I had been born Canadian.
Tom's not careful.

I was lucky.
You're impatient.
He's got a white dog.
I just want to help you.

Tell him I'm busy.
Tell them you can't do it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
It's your turn.
I didn't believe him until he came and discussed in detail with me.

Is that gonna change?
I tried to hide my disappointment.
I like both.
None of them speak French.
As far as I know, he's not married.

I'm curious.
This is where I'm going to eat.
This is a Japanese doll.
He took off his glasses.
It's good to dream.
He had a headache.
Which one of them is mine?
Tom doesn't speak French.

Mary answers the teacher's question.
They wanted to steal the car.
Do you like my new shirt?
You'll be jealous.
What's the title of your new book?
We are well aware of each other.
Mary doesn't really like Tom, even though she says she likes it.

I want to die.
Did you eat anything?
I suppose you're better than Tom.

The problem is you're not Canadian.
He'll understand.
You were forgiven.
My home is the whole world.
Tom will be ready.
You look busy.

I went inside.
Let's buy him a drink.
I think he's innocent.
Who's your teacher?

There are two zombies inside my house.
How irritating!

You can stay with me.
Are you all right, brother?
Tell him you don't need it.

What did you tell him?
He forgot to turn out the light.

The computer you use is slow.
I left the door open.
Tell him not to come.

When did you arrive?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?

I don't trust women.
I suggest you read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next sentence.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What's the most readable book in the world?

Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Go straight until you see the post office and then turn right.
You don't have to talk that hard.

There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
He'll walk.
You're ready.
We recognized them.
He's on a diet.
You're sick, you need to rest.

Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care if you like it or not.
Apologies for others is an act of politeness to yourself.
My goal is to learn your language.

Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.

Everybody likes money.
Get Thomas.

Bring Thomas in.

I'm not very good at it.
I was hoping to see Tom.
Here we are, all Canadians.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's gonna cook.

I see.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.

How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When's your birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot of stuff to do.
I honored them.
Your friend is here.
I'm thirty years old.

I'll buy one.
I understand you.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They're all running out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's futile.
Tell them it's important.
The party's on Sunday.
Here we are all Canadians.
Here's the snork.
Tom sent you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How is that word pronounced?
He saved me.
I got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get drunk.
I'm waiting for your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.

You've got thirty days.

The Russian language is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, which is widely used, although without formal recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which constituted the republics of the former Soviet Union.

Why don't you tell them?
I still try to find Tom.
- How old are you? - I'm twenty-three-year-old.
Create some water.
I wish I had been born Canadian.

I think they're going to Australia just to have fun.
Tom's cheeks are red.
I'm Richardos.
What did you open him with?
Would he like a trip to Australia?
I think she's sick.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
Tom will understand.
Where'd he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
Yesterday I had my births.
Tom has a Canadian passport.
Tell them I'm here.
Tom's never asked me for money.
He helped me a lot.
Airplanes allow people to travel long distances quickly.
You got nothing better to do?
In my opinion, you're handsome.
Let's all go home now.
In the rain to have stopped, the game has started again.
Tom has my keys.
He looks happy.
We've been well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to get me to bed, don't you?
Is it raining?
He's very slithering.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I think he's my friend.
What were you doing there?
It'll be the time you'll know.
I'll eat it.
Tell her to stop.
I told him.
We're from Boston.
Does Tom French know?
These cars are manufactured in Japan.
Can I ask you something?
I work at a bank.
We'll stop you.
The global warming is orbiting the mountain peaks into simple rocks to less than a ion.
- Did you do this Monday? - No, I didn't...
Tom's smiling.
He loves Tom, not me.
I'm pretty strict with that.
Cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Pick whoever you want.
I live in Park Street.
Where's the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
The children are asleep.
You look disappointed.
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're way faster than me.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me that's not true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom's popular.
That's very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog is white.
When are you coming?
Mary is my wife.
Looks like someone's calling you.
How many tickets did you get?
I was never in Paris.
Tom's been visiting Australia three times.
He's gonna snow today.
I heard voices.
No, thanks, I'm not drinking beer.

Do you believe in eternal life?
I'm gonna fight.
Millie doesn't eat an apple.

Go on, kneel!
Please hurry.
You're drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France, but not in the Netherlands.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.
You invited them to the party?
You need to clean up your classroom.
Why are you laughing?
We've got a lot of schools.
Mary blackmails Tom.
He's not screaming; he's screaming!
Are you from Australia?
They won.
What were you eating?
We're proud of Tom.
The horses are animals.
You're smarter than them.
Love what you do.
What football team do you support?
I'm up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom's tightened his fists.
They ate at the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, what are you doing?
I won't tell anyone you're in Boston.
Tom's hiding under bed.
Anything else?
Tom's single.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We'll paint it.
That's easy to say, it's hard to do.
She showed me her room.
When will he come?
Australia is a nice country.
They'll fix it.
I don't care if you're going or not.
It was weird.
No one understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than her.
Let me make my position clearer.
I never understood that.
She washes her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will show.
I won't be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.
Tom left for Boston.
It's not fair to Tom.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom is not your brother.
Where are you friends from?
I had a lot of coffee.
He likes walking.
The man is young.
He's not Algerian.

What does she want?
Stop that nonsense of yours.

Stop Tom.
They're older than her.
Did you hear her speak French?
I read a book last night.
He was accused of nepotism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says it's an emergency.
Tom had to accept things the way he was.
How old are you?
He likes to read newspapers.
We'll find them.
My father was Greek.
It was mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill us all.
He didn't know what to say.
I wouldn't like lying to her.
I saw Tom in the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston until October.
Make my position clearer.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadian.
You bought a new house.
You never cared about me.
The thief was disguised by a cop.
Can I get you out of here?
I thought we might stay here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be fighting all the time.
Tom gave me $30.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
He knew it from the beginning.
Everything went well.
I've been asking me a question.
Tell them to come and see me.
You played.
I wonder which route is shorter.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope to see you soon.
Carol reads Spanish.
Everybody's agreed to his idea.
Come quickly.

He's still here.
Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
He met him three years ago.
Tom translated the paper from French into English.
It was empty.
‘Thank you.’ ‘Please.’
I have something to say.
Everybody's waiting for Tom.
Tom did this to you?
You need to help your friends.
I'm not gonna lie.
Who did you go to the prom with?
You're not contributing enough.
You're my best friend.
Tom's deeds are impressive.
Give me what you got.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me alone here.
Tell them it's important.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too old for Mary.
Who found out the phone?
He forgot to turn out the light.
Give me 30 minutes.
They look happy.
They work hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You destroyed it.
You have a few books.
We're ready to help.
About what your teacher asked you?
Tom loved Mary very much.
Is that yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom is afraid of being lost.
I'm so tired.
I want to know guitar.
You like your car?
Select Mayor.
Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
It makes my life a martyr.
Tom gave me that tie.
I wish I had been born Kanady.
I miss her.
Were you happy?
She's happy.
You guys are incredibly stupid.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom sick?
What do you want?
We like kids.
He was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need it.

Are you angry?
What are you doing?

Are you a friend of Tom's?
How did you lose it?

Let me go!

You're talking Jewish?
Who sold Tom's car?
You're very curious.
Come here now.
French speaking.
We have to finish everything by Monday morning.
Yeah, sure.
Your husband is cheating on you.
Tom is obedient.
The dealers only look at the winnings.
He married him for his money.
A lot of people in the world like spicy foods.
Mary's playing piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to bed now.
I want to live in Brazil.
You should do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied.
English is not my mother tongue.
Will you give me your number, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his flaws, but I like it.
Don't believe it.
Who's your teacher?
I always hear music; I can't live without it.
It'll be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom's very quiet.
He made me a cake.
Is your car fast?
I got up this morning from 7:00.
What the hell did Tom mean with that?
He's a quiet man.
I ran to the bus stop so I wouldn't miss the last bus station.

Tom was busy.
I like laughing.
I'm rich.
You want to marry me?
I like music and English.
He slept on 10 last night.
You haven't told me who you are yet.
I have so many books as Tom.
I like that song.
You're a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me one more chance.
There's a book pile at the table.
We should choose the right person for each position.
Think first!
Do you trust this man?
Who's going to count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't get near the dog.
Yes, I'm coming!
Tom's wife and kids are missing.
Where did you go on Sunday when he passed us?
Keep both your hands on the wheel.
He made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was he born?
That's unprecedented.
No one ever came to see me at the hospital.
You're not thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's so fun to listen to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is small, although the smile lasts just a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother's here.
Betty's been here lately.
Did he admit that?
It seems to me that you don't often help other people.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
Next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know a lot of pilots.
We were fighting to survive.
We're not afraid.
Do you want that?
You're not yourself.
It was yours.
The house is too big for us, and on the other hand it's very expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They're smiling.
- Did he kiss you? - Yes, I knew it!
I'm on the deck.
I have more money than you.
Tell me about your son.

Nonsense!
I was just doing what Tom asked me to.

I like cats in the dog.
Are you alive?
He's a good singer.
Tell him I'm sick.
Tom passed away in 2013 in Australia.
My love for you is hard to explain.
What's that?
Why did you stop?

Food's good.
I'll accompany you.
Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The streets are covered with snow.
How happy I am today!
I don't see you.
She let me see her daughter.

Rejecting hurts.
I hope this continues.

What were you telling them?
Come with me to Boston.
Are you swimming a lot?
I felt awkward with so many people watching me.
I do what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom blacked his hair.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy her?
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and made dinner for me.

My dog is in heat.
My name is Farsad.
I love Tom.

Don't leave me alone.
Haven't you learned anything from your mistakes?
That's not the goal.
Don't talk about my girlfriend like that.
I didn't say he was easy.
It's raining today.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
Do you have the source code?
How horrible to think that what people say about us is true!
