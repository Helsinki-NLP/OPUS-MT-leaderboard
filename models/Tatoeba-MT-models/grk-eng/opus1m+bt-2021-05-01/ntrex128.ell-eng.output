American Members are concerned that they will be confused with the Romapets --
Some Members voiced concern over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - member of the Wales Parliament).
This concern has arisen in relation to the plans to change the name of the Parliament's assembly in Wales.
Members all over the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour Party Member stated that his prolongation worries that - will make homogeneity with the words Twp and Pwp -
For readers outside of Wales: In the Uralics, the word Ptwp- stands for Rochants -- and the word Ppwp-- means Cases --
A Plade Member stated that the whole concession was unsatisfactory - and proposed alternatives.
A Wales Conservative stated that his own concession was Rampetomyal -- about the change of name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word Romance --
In this context, the Dutch letter prescribes the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill for the adoption of a change of name, stated:
The Law of Wales of 2017 gave the Wales Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which had been widely accepted for the name of the parliament as a Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the title of Members, the Commission advocated the name of a member of the Wales Parliament - or WMP, but the MWP option was the one that had more support during the public consultation.
Members apparently suggest alternatives, but the attempt to reach a consensus may be a difficult matter for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the way the parliament operates, including rules on exemption from the Member's office and the planning of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the matter of their name during the debate on legislation.
The polls arrive in Macedonia's citizens for the referendum on the change of the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on a change in the country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia;
The people's vote was called for an attempt to resolve a ten-year conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbour's name is sub-territorial and opposed to its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, president of Macedonian referendum on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change is simply the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been hurried as the Harlem churches disappear.
-The older people I spoke to with, say that earlier there was a bar and a church in every corner -- said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of the two --
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
The world is socialized in a different way today, it said.
The bars are no longer the 'salonium' of the neighborhood where the world often gets on a regular basis.
As for the churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the relevant ones hope -- and soon as or later they will return to the point where they started --
The churches, he added, may be replaced by multi-chambers filled with people who will not be willing to help the places of worship left in the neighborhood.
The overwhelming majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white; he said, \"and so they will speed up the day when all these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that all those people who will move to these apartments will become members of the churches\"
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem Matropolis became black - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St Martin a decade later.
The early Methodists church left the 1930s.
A church of blacks that was close to distance took possession of the building.
The possession of St. Martin's building took over a black church under the reverend John Howard Johnson, who proceeded to a boycott of the shops on the 125th Street, a basic trade road in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious disasters in the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners took over the reconstruction and ordered the caring.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin's church, proudly called the harasser Rhes bells of the poor --
The specialist who played the cannon in July described it in other words: Reconstructional treasure; and Replacement of historical importance;
The specialist, Tiffani In, from the University of Michigan, also noted that he was the first carnival in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved into a bigger carnival to the Church of Riversade 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said St Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has happened in the last few months to St. Martin is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been hired by the church's folk leaders, while others from the epistle.
The Commissioners - the board of the parish, composed of the people - sent a letter to the opposition in July on their concerns that the arrest - would seek to transfer the costs - to the Commissioners' body, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the epidemic.
Shark Attack in 13-year-old dive for lobsters in California
Shark attacked and injured 13-year-old boy on Saturday during diving for lobster fishing in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack was just before 7 a.m. near Bicon Bitch beach in the city of Ensigna.
Chad Hallel told KSWB-TV San Diego that he dived with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child’s screams for help and approached enclosing with a team to get it out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just screaming excitement because he got lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, something bit me!
Something bit me!
The entire clavicle had opened up - Hamel observed when he got to the place where the boy was.
I've called everyone out of the water: 'There's sharks at sea!'- Hemel added.
The boy was airborne at the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
The seaguard Larry Giles said in the press that the shark was located in the area a few weeks earlier, but was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was suffering serious injuries on the upper part of the torso.
Authorities forbade access to the beach from Podo Beis in Kasabland to Suamis in Ensinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 kinds of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are under pressure on the UK cosmetics market.
Sainsbury's are reciprocated with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, placing shelves of cosmetics similar to those of the department stores, staffed by officials.
As part of the significant increase in the UK cosmetics market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household items are falling, larger cosmetic shelves will be placed in 11 stores throughout the country and will spread to more stores if the project succeeds.
The investment in the cosmetics sector is coming as supermarkets are looking for a way to replace the space in the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and home species.
Saintsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetic offer to 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees series will also be given more space with the company logo, similar to those of the stores such as Boots.
Supermarket is reopening its makeup Boutique series so that most products are vegan - which younger consumers are increasingly asking for.
In addition, the fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to sell its products to two Sainsbury's stores, the one that opened in Crointon, South London, last week and the other at Sheli Oak, in Bermiham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend towards buying small quantities of food daily in local minimarkets, means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Saintsbury's, said outlet stores will become increasingly similar to stores, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl excavated with more out-of-food services.
Saintsbury's put outlet Argos stores in hundreds of shops, and also introduced some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported sales of groceries and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate cosmetic and pharmacology divisions has resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a consortium with Boots in the early 2000s, but co-operation ended after a dispute over how profits were distributed from the pharmaceutical stores to the supermarkets of the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Saintsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company with 281 shops in Celesio, holder of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, as against £ 125 million, three years ago.
She stated that Lloyds will play its own role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the Shainsbury Manager, said: -We have transformed the appearance and sense of our rhetoric in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in highly trained staff that will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies is designed to cover all need, while the attractive environment and the open locations mean that we are now a destination for cosmetics which questions the traditional way of purchases;
Peter Jones: furious after Holly Willowby's departure from the 11 million £ agreement
The protagonist of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is furious after the withdrawal of televiser Holly Willobi from the 11 million agreement with the company Lifestyle, in order to dedicate its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business was likened to Guineth Palmrow Goop.
37-year-old show presenter -This Morning - announced Instagram her decision to withdraw.
Holly Willoby was mad about the protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their profitable business liffestyle at the last minute, in order to dedicate to its new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden TV girl admitted during a meeting full of tensions on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire at Marlow's, at Buckinghamshire, that due to the new contract with £ 1.5 million, it would no longer have enough time to spend on the clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company was likened to Guineth Paltrou's Goop company and appears to have doubled Willoby's property which is estimated to be at £11 million.
After 37-year-old Wiloby's announcement to Instagram that he's going to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain into one of his holiday homes.
According to some source: “Truly was a long way from Holly Willow’s top priorities.
It was its long-term future, its source of revenue for the coming decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone who is involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday so close to the presentation.
There's a storage room full of products at the headquarters in Marlowe ready to be sold —
Experts estimate that the withdrawal of the show presenter -This Morning - which is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost millions of the company because of the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to household clothing and clothing, as well as further delay in its presentation.
And this may mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, a mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband has kept close friendly relations with Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willoby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52 year old Jones joined as president in March.
Couples spend their holiday together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin TV producers.
Willobby is going to become the central person in M&S campaigns and replace Ad MacPartlin in the presentation of the PI'm A Celebrity-ITV show.
A source from Jones's narrow environment said last night - we would not like to comment on his business affairs --
We were tough -- and then we fell in love--
He was joking about the criticism he received from the media about a comment he would consider to be inappropriate to a president, as well as his positive attitude to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said imitating the style of a telecomist.
- I didn't give up.
He stated that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards the demolition of North Korea.
However, the dismantling negotiations have been delayed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, the leading diplomat of North Korea Ri Young-Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any Raparic response - from the USA following the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, it stressed that the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
We're doing very well with North Korea, he said.
- We almost had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we've built this excellent relationship...
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had given positive results - an end to missile tests, a release of hostages and a return of the other American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual attitude in statements on his relations with Kim.
It's so easy to have \"presidual\" style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting out of the room because they couldn't get in, we'd have only 200 people here-- Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their way
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lobok, for example, it has been announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organisations will not be required.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lobok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared essential for exploiting international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not seek international aid, so it is quite difficult; Mrs Subung said.
While the Save the Children organization is preparing a group that will travel to Paphos, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, representative of the national natural disaster service, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluated the situation in Papus to see whether it would be permitted for international organisations to contribute help.
Given the seismic vibrations often affecting Indonesia, the country remains unpredictable in the face of nature's anger.
While they have been built tsunami shelters in Ace, it is not the same in other coastlines.
The obvious lack of tsunami alarms in Padus, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of such lives.
At best, the move between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are even more complicated by administrative care.
A floating hospital parked in Lobok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading towards the Palos, but they will need at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joco Wido was at the heart of his campaign to improve Indonesia's deorganised infrastructure and made money available for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding is afflicting Mr Joco's administration before re-election next year.
Mr Joco is also under pressure from the persistent fanatic tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets, using stabbs, spears and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.

Daniel Sterige saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea by a goal in 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steritz took over from Serdan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team losing at 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and sued the back doll.
His effort was driven very high from the big area and ended up up right onto the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to disguise her and went in the net.
- I was trying to get this position, get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible - Steritz said at LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Candace approaching, switched directly, didn't think so much and did the shot.
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead in the half-year-old after go to the 25th minute by Belgian Star Enden Azar.
The blue aggressor gave any heel to Mateo Kovacic in this game before giving a handbag to the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovatsic made one two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, driving Azar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defensive and completed sending the ball to the nets in the back canal with left shot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight against Naples in Champions League groups at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Standard San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videton at the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.

The post-seism and tsunami deaths in Indonesia amount to 832, according to the country's natural disaster service statements, early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters, Sutopo Puro Nogrocho told a press conference.

I would also like to call on anyone, especially to the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the footages of the Dahcam cameras to communicate with us as they may have possessed information that is vital to our investigation;
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found a resident of Birkenhead and found in a building.
This afternoon's friends who think they might know the woman came to the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigations are under way as the police said they were in the process of informing the closest relatives.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the riot for Rexagraming of history;
His ritual would be poetic justice for the talented destruction of numerous cultural and religious works of England by his fanatic supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr Creek's proposal as Ranosia — and Rheinlands' attempt to rewrite the story.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Association, declared: “In this debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's form would not be targeted outside the Ostminster Palace.
The peculiarity of England's civil wars has not been dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor during the previous century.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamom Thornnicroft is a characteristic of his image during the 19th century and part of the history of a personality that many believe deserves a tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: \"Cromwell continues to be seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliament defender against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this is an absolutely precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that conflicts in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is an identifiable personality that represents one side of division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable;
Pig-slaughter hurts deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southwest China, according to local news forms.
The man, whose only last name was announced, was found with cut artery in a blood lake near a porkhouse on the market in Liowansuei in Gwichow Province, in South China Morning Post announced Sunday.
official in a porkhouse is preparing to vaccinate pigs on 30 May 2005 in Zining in Kinhei Province, China.
He allegedly traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yoonan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered open the door of a neighboring porkman.
He stated that in the porkhouse there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Examination of the coroner confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer in accordance with his report.
The legs of my cousin were bloody and devastated; the cousin, known as the name of Wu -- said according to Guyang's evening news bulletin.
The safety camera footage shows Oan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wuan or his cousin.
One market operator told the evening news report that the pig has been placed in a cage not to attack anyone else while the police collected the evidence in the attack scene.
The Wuan family and market authorities are alleged to negotiate some compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 295 kg threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer's wife terrified the animal to be removed.
Following the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was broken down by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood may act as a Rainbow.
- They're just playful mood.
They're small, very strange things... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect — he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are going to bring extensive rainfalls to the South Western USA
According to the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as he moves over the coldest water masses of the northern coasts of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rainfalls in North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States over the next few days.
The winds of Hurricane Rosa reached 85 mph, becoming Category 1 hurricanes at 5 a.m. East time, on Sunday and found 385 miles southwest of Punta Euheenia, in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, an area of low wind pressure has begun to form above the Pacific ocean and move east towards the West coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa is approaching the Purnon peninsula of Low California on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring 25 centimeters to Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity in combination with the low wind pressure area close will create extensive strong rainfalls in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2,5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous floods, flood flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will result in rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour by location, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Altitudes of 5 to 10 centimeters are expected in the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of phenomena due to the scattered nature of rainfall.
It is recommended that you avoid any walking to the desert in view of the threat to tropical rainfall.
Powerful rainfalls can turn the canyons into stem rivers and storms will cause locally filthy winds and sandstones.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally powerful rainfalls against sites on the coastline of South California.
Total rainfall heights over 1 cm are likely, which can cause small flows of debris and sliding on the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropical bores will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and in the early hours on Monday, before the appearances are extended late on Monday and Tuesday.
The powerful rainfalls will spread to the Fort Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October a number of intense temperature changes will be observed across the US as the temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in tropical zones remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very marked temperature changes in nearby distances.
A characteristic example of the intense temperature differences between the central USs was observed on Sunday.
A difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
During the next few days persistently high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In a large part of the Central and Eastern US, October is expected to start with high temperatures with 27 °C from the Eastern plains to parts of the southeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there are several possibilities to observe temperatures above the average in the East American to the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers attended Brett Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million TV viewers followed the repressive testimony of the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, on Thursday and the woman accused him of sexual assault, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blaisie Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political deadlock continued, with the television networks interrupting the normal flow of the program to overturn the last minute on Friday: the agreement by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Fleik to investigate a week from the FBI in relation to the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure how at a party while Kavanaugh high school students attacked her while she was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a loaded statement, said he was 100 percent sure that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, it's possible that more than 20.4 million television viewers were attended on Friday.
The company calculated the average display on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
Numbers were not immediately available for other transmission networks including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers attending a transmission from office spaces.
Let's see this TV show in its right dimensions, it's common proportional to what's tracking a play-off football match or the award ceremony of the Oscar Awards.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Kavano, was preceded by an average of 5.69 million teleshoppers during the entire hearing, according to Nielsen.
In the second place, ABC is located with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was followed with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleke emerged a protagonist in the drama on Friday.
After the statement of the Republican moderate that he would vote in favour of Kavano, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters deploring him as he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing by the Senate Justice Committee.
He stood with low looking for several minutes as he was being rendered, live on television at CNN.
- I stand here before you - a woman said.
- Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He told him, You have power when so many women are powerless --
Fleik said his office had made statements and, before the lift doors closed, he would have said more to the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and broadcasting networks covered live hours later, the vote of the Senate Committee on Justice on the promotion of Kavano's candidacy in plenary session to vote.
But Fleik said he would only do it if the FBI investigated claims against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Fleke was persuaded in part by talks with his friend, Senator of the Democratic Party, Chris Kuns.
After discussions with Kuns and some other Senators, then, Fleik decided.
Fleik's choice had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather the votes for Kavano's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Tramp called for an FBI investigation into claims against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames her critics for playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the European Union critics of playing political games - with Britain's future and undermine the national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Conservative Party's Conference in Berminham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with hers in the newspaper headlines, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is critical of the Brexit Chekers project, saying that the proposal to collect customs duties between Britain and the EU was quite absurd;
Shooting Wade Simms: Police arrested suspect Dyton Simpson for the murder of the player in LSU
Police arrested a suspect in the mortal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team player.
Diateon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained in prison with a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have a video of Sims' engagement with Simpson, and according to the police, Simms lost his glass during the fight.
Policemen spotted the glasses at the crime scene and said they spotted traces of Simson's DNA, according to the WAFB that works with CBS.
After Simpson interrogation, the police said he admitted to wounding Wade.
His proximity was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by the East Baton Rouge coroner who released Friday, cause of death is the bullet injury to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the police in Louisiana a special working party, the police forensics lab, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the area for assistance to the arrest investigation.
The sports director of LSU Joy changed his thanks to the local law enforcement authorities for the Unaccepted investigation and the pursuit of justice -
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m highload raised Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ribouds per match last season.
Friday morning, the LSU's basketball team coach said the team was a decorator -- and a shock status -- from Wade's death.
- We're always worried about incidents like this -- Owyd said.
Emissions of volcanic ash in Mexico City
The volcanic ash emissions from the volcano Popokapetel arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Destroy Prevention Center warned Mexico residents on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, since the crater activity reached its peak, recording 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The Center watched various signs and small seismic vibrations.
Images in social media show car impulse covered with thin layers of ash at Mexico City neighborhoods such as Sochimilko.
The geophysics observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 rock earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as RDDON Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces conflict with Catalan separatists in the wake of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday following a conflict of protesters in favour of independence with the order restitution units, as thousands took part in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on Catalonia's secession that caused polarisation.
A group of masked demonstrators for independence, which was held by the order restitution units, poured eggs and paint in powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the roads that are usually flooded by tourists.
Complications were also noted later during the day with police officers using their clubs to suppress the complications.
For hours groups of Catalonia's independence supporters cried for the motto, we don't forget -- against groups of protesters in favour of the unity of the country that shouted -I live in Spain --
Fourteen persons were hospitalized with microwaves that occurred during the protests, according to the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region supporting independence a year after the referendum of 1 October was declared illegal from Madrid, but are still celebrating by separatists Catalan.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the turnout was low with those who are against independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year, following the efforts of the police authorities to interrupt the vote in the polls in the area where violent conflicts occurred.
Groups for independence were scattered on Friday in order to prevent a demonstration of national police support.
The protest took place others had to take a different turn.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the protests for independence with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
We've lived one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy they were able to vote for, but the situation is now stavable; he said.
Although they have made a victory of vital importance, although limited in regional elections last December, Catalan parties for independence have struggled to maintain their potential this year, with many of their well-known leaders being self-executed or detained pending their trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Poots, a 42-year-old engineer, who recorded with his mobile protests in favour of police, said the clashes were powered by politicians of both camps.
The tension is escalating increasingly — he said.
On Saturday, Oril Zunchera, one of the nine Catalan leaders condomed last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for the next year.
- My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the slap of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government - he said.
London: Arrest of man after car impact in a residence

Inspector Bob Blammings said damages were caused to the gates and the building itself.
There might have been a gunshot in the car sometime.
Menga's blow gave Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Proven Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Jerard only his second defeat at 18 games as managers of the Improx group.
Doli Menga's blow made the difference as Garry Holt's side changed a level with Himperinian in second place.
Jerard's team is left without a win off in the championship this season and faces the Harts, who have the lead with eight degrees, the next Sunday.
Before this race, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna at Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston in the meantime continues to race her six toys in her charge, with major coach Holt not yet experienced any defeat since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston is losing opportunities to guests.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before it scores, with its insensibility to embarrass the Rangers.
Scott Robinson got a head start, and he almost got there just before the end, but Alan Lithgou disobeyed his attempt to slip the Craig Hallet head away from the end.
The fieldmen willingly allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could narrow the visitors to the free strikes and korners.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Rangers couldn't stop a free hit and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who took the opportunity and scored from the center of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball but found the field defense impenetrable and the finalist Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos disobeyed the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pitman's ball disguised from the feet of Rangers' finalist Alan McGregor and the whole of Lithgous came out in another free hit of Livingston.
There were many vertical stakes in the Livingston region and they were constantly disobeyed, when two penalty were applied for - following a vindication of the ball by Halckett against the substitute glen Midleton player and one for the hand - which were rejected.
-Excellent game - from Livingston - analysis
Alander Lamond from BBC Scotland field on the Makaroni Arena Course
Thematic performance and results for Livingston.
They were all exquisitely overcoming expectations in this upward course.
The game style and their personality changed little after their return to top form, but the credits should also be given to Halt for the push he gave the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halckett was excellent, engaging an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrell in vigilance throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the contrary, had no inspiration.
As good as there were in the past under Jerard's guidance, they did not respond to these standard.
Their last game was incomplete - only once have managed to pass the defense of landmarks and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of rank.
Mixed emotions in Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the Heads of State or Government of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with the allies in NATO.
They had come to a break in relation to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest community of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police have ruled out the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have managed to get close to their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdish - also condemned by both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dilemma of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish people as a hero and by others as dictator.
Race accident in Detfort: bicycle death following a collision with a car
A biker died in conflict with a car in London.
The accident took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detfort, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the ground.
The collision occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a bicycle, who lost his life on Tsilders Street, at about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan police said the authorities are trying to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have closed and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Guards: Six police officers were injured in bands
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in men's high security prisons, according to statements from the prison department.
Rapids broke out in His Majesty Long Lentin's prison in Worstershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces - Tornado - have been returned to face the riots, involving eight prisoners and manifested in a wing.
Police have been hospitalized with facial microwaves during complexes.
A prison spokesman stated: “Specially trained personnel undertook to deal with the incident in His Majesty Long Lartin's prisons.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spread a greater penalty.
In the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners are detained, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the prison manager was hospitalized following an attack by a prisoner.
In October of last year, the order-response units in prison were called to take serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas with drought may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical recession will hit Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing floods to their passage.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency warning notes for floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Yuta, including Phoenix, Fluggstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to go right above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late on Monday in rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only Rhodes of tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or a low barometric situation less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an typhoon at a distance of less than 40 miles from the border of Arizona;
The latest models of the US National Gypsy Center forecast a 2 to 4 inches rainfall, with individual rainfall volumes of up to 6 inches in the Mogoloum Reim of Arizona.
In other parts of the Southwest States, including the Central Rails and Grat Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rain volumes up to 4 inches.
For the regions that are not at risk from the floods, the rain that Rosa brings may be a blessing, as the area is drought-threatening.
Although the floods are a very serious issue, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the South-West States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Dryer Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reported waterer.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the land in the Bhaha California peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the hurricane intensity, on Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenenia, Mexico, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and moving to the north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to reach land in Mexico with rain storm intensity on the afternoon or on Monday evening.
There may be strong rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
Total volumes of rainfall of 3 to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora are expected, likely to reach up to 10 inches -- according to the water.com.
Then Rosa will head north by crossing Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the border of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Yuta late on Tuesday's evening.
The main risk expected by Hurricane Rosa or its residues is the very strong rainfall in Baha California, the Northwest Sonora and the Southwest States of the United States of America -- the US National Hygiene Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous intense floods and winter muds in deserts and lands in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted homicide
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as suspected homicide attempt after finding a 16-year-old man who brought knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Midsomer Norton Exels area, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.

A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old was arrested during the night in the Radstock district, the police of Avon and Somerset said.
Cops appeal to anyone who can have recorded in videos on his cell phone what happened.
Trump says Cavanaugh Revealed the wickedness and anger of the Democratic Party.
The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote for the disquieting and extremist tactics of the Democratic Party; Trump said at a gathering in West Virginia Wiling.
Trump said Kavanaugh Revealed the wickedness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his probation process as a candidate.
Kavano testified to Congress on Thursday, denying an unequivocally and evidently touching the claims of Christine Blaisy Ford that she was sexually attacked by decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also filed before the hearing for her allegations.
The President stated on Saturday that the Roman people saw the grandeur, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh that day.
The vote on the confirmation of Judge Cavanaugh's candidacy is a vote for confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a legal one with an excellent course of public service; he told the crowd of supporters in Western Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the candidacy of Kavano, while he was talking about the importance of the Republican participation in the interim elections.
We have five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but in fact it's like I'm a -- she said.
- That's why I'm traveling everywhere by supporting excellent candidates...
Trump said the Democrats are on a Response Mission and obstruction --
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on Kavano's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, said CNN a senior supporter of the Republican Party's leadership.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims are projected to increase.
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away from the giant waves that scanned the coasts, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Sulaweesi island of Indonesia, the authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival at the beach of Paul on Friday, when waves of six meters invaded the superfluous land, luring many to death and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami appeared after an earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
-When the threat of tsunami yesterday occurred, the world was still on the beach and did not run immediately, so it was struck by it - said Sutopo Pourgo Nogroch, representative of the BNPB disaster response service of Indonesia, in information to Jakarta.
- Tsunami didn't come by itself, dragged cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land - Nugroho said, adding that tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into the trees to get out of the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palau.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Restoration Service show many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that have been swirled and collapsed and a water enclosed tendencies.
Migrations continued to hurt the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes have become noticeable in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's IT Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported in a notice that the energy released from the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell into Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may increase the size of tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damages as Extended -- and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
He said that victims found themselves trapped under the crash of buildings they collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroh said that victims and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Paphos, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
The communication systems - they completely escaped and there is no information - from Dongala, she said.
- More than 300,000 people live there -- the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are headed to the areas affected.
It is already a tragedy and it can get worse even more — he said.
A review was exercised at the Office on Saturday because it did not inform that tsunami had hit the Pavlos, although according to officials the waves had reached the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video that was notified on social media, it sounds like a man on the top floor of a building yelling panic, trying to warn people down on the road for the tsunami coming.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, drifting houses and cars.
Reuters agency was unable to verify immediately the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great deal of power outage, which also interrupted communications in the wider region of the Old, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army began sending aerial planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the displaced still need desperate food and other basic species of primary need.
The city airport was only reopened to contribute to assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Windo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palou on Sunday.
The victims of tsunami in Indonesia are over 800.
The situation is really bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to get safely to the city of Palau, where the workers found shelter in accommodations from museums set up in their office, they passed through scenes of destruction in their course, Mr. Doseba said.
- They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses -- he said.
The situation is really bad.
While some relief teams have undertaken the sad task of starting the relief procedure for the wounded, some denounce that it has not been allowed to strangers, particularly experienced workers in the field of aid to travel to Paphos.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be initiated if the location of a disaster is declared a zone of national destruction.
This has not happened yet.
-Aulia Arriani said, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says that this is a national disaster, we can ask for international assistance, but there is no decision on it yet.
As the second day passed in Paros after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the story of these natural disasters less gloomy.
On Saturday, a little boy was recovered from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Genton Subadano, the coach of the Indonesian national parachutist group, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Maddagji, were his students.
As an older man in the parachuting plaque sport, I have my own emotional load -- he said.
Mr. Genton was told how, when news was released about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of parachutist slopes, he began to send desperate messages to his opponents in Paphos who participated in the beach festival.
However, the indication next to his messages was a grey Ron- symbol instead of two blue.
- I think that means the messages weren't delivered - he said.
Thieves have posted $26.750 during the supply of automatic takeover machine to Newport and Levi.
On Friday morning, thieves were seconded to $26.750 by a Brink employee who was supplying ATM machine to Newport, and Levi, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine to the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, said in the announcement police Dennis McCarthy.
While busy, another man came running behind Brink's clerk -- and stole a bag of money that was intended for surrender.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the point, according to the announcement, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity should contact the police in Newport, calling 859-292-3680.
Kaye West: Ruper changes his name to Ye
Ruper Kaye West is changing his name to Ya.
Recognizing the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: \"The one officially known as Kaye West\"
West, 41 years old, he's been listening to the dissident Son for a long time and used this pseudonym as a title in his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was preceded by its appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, where it is expected to present its new album called Yandhi.
Replaces the show by singer Ariana Grant, who canceled her appearance for “emotional reasons - as the creator of the show said.
Besides being a short description of the professional name he uses today, West had stated in the past that the word is religiously important to him.
- I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means Reese - West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with Big Boy radio producer.
So it's me, it's us, it's us.
My name is changing from Kane, which means the only one -- to Ya, which is just a reflection of good, bad, of our confused self, of all.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are.
It's one of the several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Shin Cobbs is known with various names, such as Puff Dandy, P. Deddy or Deddy, but he announced this year that he prefers the names Lav and Bride Lav.
A former partner of West, TZEY-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without obliterated letters and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico swears he won't use the army against the civilians.
Mexican elected President Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn to have never used military violence against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody student repression.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatelolko Plaza Square that Rhodes will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people --
On October 2, 1968, troops fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when the left student movements were taking roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support the young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are encouraging young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is active more actively in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount spent on research in this area, states the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to add to communications from different parts of the US Government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not generally have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan to become the first country in the world in innovation in artificial intelligence matters by 2030.
-The doubling of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so low in the United States and we are seeking to make the next significant discovery in the field of artificial intelligence - Li said.
The doubling of the budget could double the possibilities of taking place in the USA the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Li said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Li, whose book titled PAI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order -- (The Utilities of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) released this month from the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt versions, is Managing Officer of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the top companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the best American Othello player, and later he was an executive member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Annex to China.
Li recognised the importance of previous US government technology contests, such as the DARPA Robotic Challenge of the Service of Advanced Defence Research Plans (DARPA), and wondered when the next visionaries would take place to identify them.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive state grants, Lee said.
- It's not China that gets the best of the academic space, it's the companies -- it said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Li argued that changes in migration policy could also help the USA to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
- I think that a green card should be automatically offered to a PhD holder in artificial intelligence - he said.
The State Council of China adopted a Development Plan for the Artificial Immunities Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic establishments such as the National Institute of Sciences and other governmental organisations share money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic project in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners will join the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an Electoral Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation currently invests over $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in the US legislation for months with the aim of creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian citizens are holding a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Macedonian people participated in a referendum Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia; a move that would solve a decades disagreement with Greece which had blocked the country's membership candidate in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the Northern Neighbourhood, represents a dispute on its territories and has exercised veto on its entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonian majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the required 50 percent to validate the referendum.
The question on the issue of the vote was this: -You are in favour of NATO joining the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece -
The proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worthy of being paid to seek entry to organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I was here today to vote for the future of the country, so that Macedonian youths could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because all our lives would be safer, said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of Parliament have declared that they will comply with the outcome of the vote in order to become definitive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required for a change of name.
The state election commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, participation reached just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, and gave the present 66 percent of registered voters.
-I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe - Joseph Tanevski, 62 years old, voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaev, the wife of Zorika and his son Dusko voted in the referendum for the change of the country's name, which would open the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union to the city of Stromika on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarkov, 54, is preparing a small scene and chairs are placed in front of scenes set by those who will boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not as second-class partners; Cavardarkov said.
- We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union;
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring a multi-purpose investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, Zaev said after he voted.
He said a positive outcome would be - confirming our future --
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research will take place in the referendum from 30 to 43 percent of the voters, which is lower than that required.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telema TV Station, 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said he would vote positive.
To be successful in the referendum, participation must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy, from its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City Sergio Awarero goes through Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Awaro and Rahim Sterling constituted Brighton's defense by achieving a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday in Ethid Steintoum in Manchester, England.
Awarero showed him scores easy to score in the 65th minute.
Argentine aggression took all over the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Brighton defensives before he went to the open room.
Awayro was found surrounded by four green players.
He walked by a defensive, then escaping several others at the edge of Brighton's big area.
Then he gave his way to his left, finding Sterling.
English forward made his first move in the area returning the ball to Awarero, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton Matthew Ryan's terminator, scoring on the right side of the nets.
- Awayo's facing some problems on his feet... - Said the reporter of Cetti, Pep Guardiola.
We told him to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored that moment--
However, he was Sterling the blue man who gave the original advantage to the Battle of Premier Lig.
That goal came to the 29th minute.
Awarero took the ball deep into Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept his possession and led Sterling toward the back doll.
The blue blue dress kicked the ball in the net just before it got out.
City is facing Hoffenheim in Championships Ligg's groups on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rynn-Nakar Arena court in Shinsim, Germany.
Serzer wants to beat the Rockies.
As the Nissinals were excluded from play-offs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the always competitive Serzer is hoping to play Sunday against Colorado Rockes, but only if there is still some impact on the Rockies on play-offs, as they precede a game of Los Angeles Dodgers in the National Ligg West.
The Rockies have gone into play-off with their victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first place in their category.
As far as we do not have something to win, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and the other group will probably be a game of the highest level I deal with this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in such a race?
The Nationals haven't even announced who will be the original stripper on Sunday, but they're allegedly tending to let Serzer drop the ball.
Serzer, who will make his 34th start, gave training shots on Thursday and plays on Sunday, which is normally a rest day for him.
The DC-manager has a performance of 18-7 with average profitable points (ERA) of 2,53 and 300 out of turn to 220 2/3 seasons this season.
Trump speaks West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his chosen candidate for the Brett Cavano Supreme Court, in his speech on the importance of the Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
This is a very important time, and I'm not a candidate, but in fact it's like I'm and that's why I'm traveling everywhere to support excellent candidates, he said.
Trump continued by saying: - See this terrible, terrible radical group of republics, you see what is happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and they're not going to give them.
Democrats, he said, have taken over a mission of Resistance and obstruction;
- And you see this in the last four days - he said, describing the Democrats - angry and bad, lousy and liars -
He referred to the Senate Judicial Committee by name mentioning to the senator of Democratic Dianne Fainstein, a petition accepted by the public with potential disapprovals.
Do You Remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer. This was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a wide-ranging party.
It is not tolerable to those who express their opinion
I was not very surprised at the fact that activists of the Momentoum movement in my local group voted to veto me.
Besides, I am the last of a series of Members of the Labour Party to whom they have said they are not welcome, precisely because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because she has reacted decisively to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticised because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, as paradoxically, on similar issues as Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to meet Notingham Ist on Friday said that we would like our meetings to be productive with everyone involved.
Most of the eight years I was a local member of the Labour Party, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today, it is not this tone of many meetings and the promise of a rosy, more compassionate, policy has been forgotten for some time if it has ever really begun to happen.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began a little after Jeremy became the leader, as I previously thought that we had such political views, started waiting for me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views with which I would never agree, whether they were national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was really saying, I was listening to a fisherman on social media, where some were asking for my rejection, they denounced the centre's policy and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a sibling of sexist or racist insults every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a wide-ranging party, and that with every motion of censure or change of selection rules, the party's limits are narrow.
I've been advised a lot of people over the past two years not to rise up, not to speak a lot, and that'll be all right.
But I didn't go into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, due to the neglect shown by the Thacher government, which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my aim was to defend better public services for those who need them most, whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, and I've done the same in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way with regard to my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will hit our households, businesses and public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, my only message is not addressed to the Momentum movement in Nottingam, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political feasibility will prevent me from acting as I believe to be in the best interest of all of you.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: Invincible Air Rises to top
Two late goals may have turned somewhat the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining game of Tened's championship.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only naughty group of ten.
Finally, she was her superior defense, as well as the better exploitation of the opportunities that raised the balance for the landlords and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
- We've been tested in our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robin Christy of Melrouge stated: \"Congratulations to Ir have taken advantage of opportunities better than we've been\"
The Gold Anderson Goal in the 14th minute, with the conversion of Frasier Climo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by Worriors, allowed Melros to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Bagot noted a goal without conversion.
Climo increased Air's headlight with a penalty before scoreing, right in the half-yearly, a goal with conversion, leading Air to the locker room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's go to, with Bagot's conversion, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait because of a serious injury of Rurid South, who was removed by a truck, and after the reopening, Air increased the difference with a goal of Staffford McDonald, with the conversion of Climo.
The deputy chief Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrowse reused the arithmetic advantage with Bruce Colvin's gossip without conversion, after a time of intense pressure.
The fieldmates came back, however, and, when Struan Hatsinson took a yellow tick card to Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, McFurson scored a goal on the back of the attack that I've evaded.
Klima turned out, as he did almost back from the resurgence, after Kaily Rowee first collected David Armstrong's kick and sent extremist Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the landlords.

The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the BBC's popular BBC show, which he's been writing, and in which he's been joining him for years in Greg Hebfil's comrade.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle would also be the last of the show and it would appear that Kiran is planning his life after Gaigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited company.

The sea is ours: The blocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Seamen patrol the fully equipped navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, blue flags are waved.
On the bases of the navy from Lake Titika to the Amazon is the slogan: -The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It's our duty to get her back.
Throughout the land of Bolivia, the remembrance of the coastline that Chile conquered following a bloody confrontation for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have been made more up today than ever for decades, as Bolivia expects the International Court's decision on October 1st following five years of consultation.
Bolivia has the dynamic, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course it awaits the result positively; Roberto Kalazantila, Bolivian diplomat, said.
Many Bolivians will watch the extradition of the International Court's ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's vindication that Chile, after decades of unstable talks, should negotiate on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's gifted throng president, who gives a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has much to win or lose from Monday's decision.
We're very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean -- he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN institution in the Netherlands does not have the power to give millennium territories and it has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court is to be delivered only six months after the presentation of the final arguments suggests that the Roth case was not complex — Paz Zarates, a Chilean international law expert, said.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's goals, the last four years may have undermined them.
Today's Bolivia government has come to a halt to the question of access to the sea -- Zante said.
The aggression rhetoric of Morales has exhausted any remaining good mood of Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after that.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edwardo Rodriguez Velze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court ruling was unusually fast.
On Monday Bolivia will have an excellent opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile, and the possibility to end disputes of 139 years of age with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzantila also denied that Morale, who still is one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, is using the issue of exit to the sea as a political nozzle.
Bolivia will never deny her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean; she added.
The decision is a chance to see that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the USA
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Young Ho, says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ree spoke Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
It called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the Heads of the two States.
Ree made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pombao seemed ready to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy he had reached in a gut, three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Young Eun.
Ry states that the view that the ongoing sanctions and the refusal of the United States to preach the end of the Korean War will at some time force the Northerns to Dragon -- is a dream of summer night.
Washington is reluctant to agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pioneying does not first make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is a wide skepticism about whether Pioneyang is seriously thinking about declaring an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only means to guarantee its safety.
Pombao plans to visit Pioneyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trab summit.
Paris fashion demonstrations reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to raise your hat collection or avoid completely the sun, then stop looking.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers presented a series of different supermagnetic hats for their collection Spring-Kalkory 2019 that stole the performance at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Excellent uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer, and designers sent their impressive creations to the passor.
The part that separateed Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide band with wings that completely covered the head of models.
Among other oversized accessories they presented watermelons decorated with stones, a cheek hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, on time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewed lips and more responded to Hanibal Lecter than to high septic fashion.
One creation brought into mind complete diving equipment with a vent and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream on a pod.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could be reached on central commercial roads near you.
Oversized hats have made their appearance very quickly after the Rola Boba - the scissorst hat with the very wide one we have seen wearing so many, from Riiana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The popular french that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media has also sent a great creation in the pansararela, a fisherman beach bag almost as large as the model that carries it by wearing his bathing suit.
The dark orange bag of shelves, decorated with racks of shelves and a white leather handle, was the piece that distinguished from the La Riviera Spring-Kokokhari 2019 collection of Jacquemus in the Fashion Week in Paris.
The stylist of the famous, Luke Armitage, said in the FEMAIL column: -I expect to see large hats and large beach bags in the shopping shops next summer, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories -
John Edward: Language skills necessary for people in the world
The independent schools of Scotland have prehistoric history in academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with another series of exceptional results in the tests, which were merely further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent School Council (SCIS), are struggling to provide their students and parents with the best possible level of services.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare their pupils for the coming and higher educational levels, the professional career they will choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational area that can design and implement a school curriculum on order, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable selection course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, \"If you speak to someone in a language he understands, then what you say goes into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, what you say gets into his heart...
This is a strong reminder of that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relations and confidence with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of the exams, we find that the languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved a degree of ransom A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a degree of apolysis in mandarins, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of Spanish were also grade A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as a selection lesson, are regarded as equally important as the courses concerning science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
Research by the UK Employment and Skills Committee in 2014 revealed that, with regard to the reasons why employers were finding it difficult to cover job vacancies, a percentage of 17 percent was related to a lack of language skills.
The need for language skills is therefore becoming increasingly imperative, so that young people are prepared for their future career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future because of this skill that he can make use of throughout his life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then this multilingual individual will automatically have an advantage over competition.
According to an investigation by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents were unable to speak some foreign language well enough to have a conversation while French was the only two-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investment in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find employment with meaning.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classic contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
For anything that your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland provide devotion to a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever the future holds them.
One cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered — international communication skills —
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scottish youths.
They have to.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent School Council.
Lebron will do his debut to the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting for the fans who look forward to Lebron making his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers arrived almost at the end.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the first game before the Denver Nagets race season in San Diego.
However, he hasn't been decided yet how many minutes he'll play.
-It will be more than one and less than 48 -- Walton said on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James asked about his plans about the six toy program that the Lakers had to give before the agonizing period.
-I don't need prep races at this stage of my career to prepare - he said.
Trump concentration in Western Virginia, YouTube Canal
President Donald Trump begins a series of mergers starting in West Virginia Wing.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump gatherings next week, which include tours in friendly adjacent areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
By a vote of confirmation of his choice for the Supreme Court to be awaited, Trump seeks to strengthen popular support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trump concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Tramp's gathering at West Virginia Wiling is scheduled for 7 pm. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trump concentration in Western Virginia online below by living streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to the hearings this week for the candidate for the position at the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, which took place in a tent atmosphere due to the claims of sexual misconduct, with a vote of confirmation of the Senate being held for up to a week while the FBI investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help the Republicans who are facing an indisputable outcome in the November elections in order to win some dynamic.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five gatherings next week aim to prompt volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majoritys that have in the Senate and the House of Representatives - according to Reuters.
-The control of Congress is as critical for its agenda, which the president travels as many states as possible, as we travel in the busy period of the campaign -- he told Reuters representative of the Trump campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned tonight gathering at Wesbanco Arena of Wiling could bring supporters from Rohoo and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh’s media according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month Trump visited West Virginia, the state that won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, candidate of the Republicans in Western Virginia for the Senate, who is low in the polls.
It is not a good sign for Morrisy that the president should come and try to give him a push to the polls; Simon Hunter said, political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has the power to fight by keeping hopes alive as it drives on Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday's quarters may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The entrenched momentum is a completely invented sport idea, but players believe it deeply, particularly in such measurements.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
-They were preceding six points, and now it's ahead of four, so we probably have a little moment, - Jordan Speth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, to precede four degrees and to remain twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spitth says, feel Reaer in their sails -- and have a lot to encourage them, such as the Spith and Justin Thomas twin that played together all day, and everyone got three degrees out of four.
Stepith was deadly from tee to green and set an example.
The voices of celebrations became stronger as he continued his round, making a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit with which they won the game at 15th was accompanied by similar pantographs showing his belief that the American team is not out.
You need to look deep into you and worry about your own game -- Spith said.
It's what each player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more points than Speth and Thomas over the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unambiguous story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin of Europe has achieved four or four, and it seems it is not doing anything wrong.
The PMI was the only twin that didn't hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way energy seems to flow towards both the noisy viewers, is embracing the fact that it is the players who should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun is setting over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time to different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two double on the front nine they had the Spaniard and the Swedish so deep into a hole they couldn't get out of.
On Sunday, though, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourball and Foursome are so exciting to watch them closely because of interactions between couples, advice they give, advice they do not give and how a strategy can change at a time.
Europe has been better played as a team so far and has a major lead on the last day, but this race foursome has also shown that the US team has the guts, despite the doubts of some.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its headship in the fourball and foursome of Saturday with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspiring twin of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari loaded two victories against a fighter Tiger Woods and succeeded in getting the lead on Le Golf National until now in four degrees.
The European side of Thomas Biorn, who tries to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unfortunate American side in the mornings from the mornings to the mornings.
The U.S. opposed more to fusome, gaining two struggles, but they could not cover the difference.
Jim Furk's side needs eight points from Sunday 12 single matches to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European emerging player who wins four degrees, while along with Molinari, also known as PMollywood -- after a shocking weekend, it is just the second twin that wins four degrees in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By crushing Woods and Patrick Reid at the fourball, they felt their powers to destroy a tireded Woods and the American newly-informed Bryson DeSampo with a even more emphatic 5-24.
Woods, who crawled on the two races of Saturday, showed occasional explosions of gloriousness, but has lost 19 of his 29 races in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning tourball, returned to Henry Stenson's teammate about the foursome with 2-1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka, conquering the first and third position in the global ranking.
Not all went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
The three times winner Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans two degrees on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2 &1 victory over John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain at the fourball and later returned to defeat the Poulter and Rory McKillroy 4 & 3 at the foursome while they lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team was able to recover while losing four degrees in singles, although because he is the troupe, Furice is sufficient to win a match to keep the trophy.
However, since it was found in second place for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is outside of their capabilities.
North Korea says it's not going to disarm unilaterally with no confidence measures.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations Saturday that ongoing sanctions deepen distrust against the United States and that his country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ry Young Ho told the annual general meeting of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken Goodwill Optical measures — in the past year, e.g. the interruption of nuclear and ballistic tests, the dismantling of nuclear test facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see any such response from the United States - it said.
Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to initiate unilaterally our disarmament-
While Ry repeated known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a Radical — a dismantling approach, according to which North Korea will be rewarded as it moves forward in the process, his statement was important as it did not completely rule out unilateral demolition, as Pionyang did in the past.
Ri reported to the public in an announcement by Kim Young Won and Donald Trump at the first summit held between a active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the reprocessing of the Korean peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee the safety of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pioneyang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US is insisting on becoming \"first decontamination\" and increasing pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve their purpose by extorting even the \"end-of-war demonstration\" -- Ree said.
-The perception that sanctions can kneel us down is a dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust--
Ri did no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon J-in in the past five months and added: - If the partner on the issue of demolition was South Korea and not the USA, the demolition of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock,
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different since last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the United States hinterland with North Korea's ballistic missiles was inevitable because the Russian President-Trab called Kim Ropyllian-man on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to — completely destroy — North Korea, washed Kim's praise for his courage to proceed with disarmament measures, but said that there is still much to be done, and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is demoralised.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a schedule for this, saying, if it takes two years, three years or five months, it's okay.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyong for the measures it has taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council Thursday that: PPC sanctions must continue intensively and continuously until full, final and confirmed detonation is achieved;
The Security Council unanimously adopted sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to neutralise the funding of Pioneyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pombao met with Ri on the margin of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pioneyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pombao has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Piunyang in July saying that progress had been made, to denounce North Korea a few hours later, that he had, the demands of a gangster,
North Korea has committed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantling a missile facility and also a nuclear complex, if the United States were taking Ri-parliamentary measures...
He explained that Kim told him that the Rare Responsibility measures - which he seeks were security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and promote the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses on how to rest well enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing mass of a whole-night study culture by eating a lot of caffeine.
An academic found out that students at number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, e.g. how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, professor of Medical Hypn at Harvard Medical School and specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the lesson, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the lesson after a speech on the effects of sleep deprivation in learning.
- In the end, a girl came to me and said, - Why am I learning about it just now, in my last year?
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me - told her in The Telegraph.
The lesson, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as the improvement of general prosperity.
Paul Baraira, professor of Psychiatrics at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, stated that the university decided to include the lesson when it was found that students were lacking sleep within the week to a significant extent.
The mature course includes a series of interactive work.
In a section there is the image of a student dorm, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is influenced by sleep lack, as well as the importance of sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
A university map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it will not change the behavior of students directly.
We believe, however, that they have a right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke - Professor Chisler added.
The culture of pride because you studied all night, he said, adding that modern technology and constant pressure to students means deprivation of sleep is a problem healing.
Adequate sleep, good quality, should be the Rhystic weapon - students in fighting stress, depletion and stress, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as withdrawal of sleep puts the brain in a starvation state, resulting in a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond Sha, a 19-year-old California who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Chisler design his lesson, after attending one of his ranks last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson all over the campus.
The next step, hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar project before starting their studies in this highly competitive educational establishment.
Professor Chisler advised students to regulate a notice for the time they should go to bed, as well as an alarm clock for the awakening times, and to know the harmful effects of the Roble light - emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disconnect the circadio rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores Jerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad defeat from the outside, as Doli Menga's set led the dismantled side of Steven Jerard to be defeated with 1-0 at Livingston.
Aimprox's team sought to mark her first victory off of the February triumph by 4-1 in Saint-Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team created Jerard's second defeat in 18 games as coach, leaving the group eight degrees behind Charts, which is the first to rank the Ladbrokes championship.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-year-old and the Rangers' uninitiated roster seemed unable to return.
While Rangers is now falling into the sixth place, Livingston goes up to the third, with just a goal of the Himperinian premier.
And Rangers can expect more trouble, as supervisor Kalom Spence had to get first aid for injury to the head caused by an object that was thrown out of the platform.
Jerard made eight changes in team composition and depressed Aer to the semi-finals for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition, Levi 11 -- that took a grade from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well - toned machine was able to drown out every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should've scored in the second minute, when Menga's first farewell all of him sent Scott Pitman into the area of Alan McGregor, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep free kit of Kegan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halckett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow all he could do was send the ball away from the dorm.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed he should have won a penalty in 15, as he was confronted with Stephen Loules, but referee Steven Thompson ignored Colombian complaints.
Rangers only had two shots in the area in the first half, but former terminal guard of Improx, Liam Kelly, had nothing to worry about from Lasanah Kulibalie's head and Ovi Ezzar's subtonal shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race Livi was clearly less than anticipated, no one can deny that it deserved victory for the effort alone.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher overloaded the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and found Menga, who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half-yearly by pulling Kullibali and putting Ryan Kent in. The change almost immediately, as the extrem had the ball over to Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure the guests in the style of the game that she knows and enjoys, with the Lithgou and Hulket to remove one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgo's attempt by the korner.
The Rangers substitute, Glenn Midlton, had another phase for a penalty to the end, as he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson ignored it again.
Almanak: The Inventor of Metropolitan Giger
A page from Almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BALLE ... the day that in Germany was born the future natural Johann Velhelm Rhans-Gigger.
Gaiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, and this invention eventually led to the device now known as the Gaiger meter.
Cylon of science since then, metrometer Geiger passed into the pop culture, such as in the 1950 movie called Bells of Coronado, the protagonists of the unlikely cowboys scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
- What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Guiger meter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of the people who are caused by radiation to metallic components;
Evans: Look, he's acting crazy!
Hans Gaiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention of his name continues its work.
New anticancer vaccine teaches immunosuppressive to see - troubled cells
New anticancer vaccine teaches immunosuppressive to see - troubled cells and kills them
Vaccine teaches immunosuppressive to identify problematic cells in the course of treatment
The method includes the export of immunocytes from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
They canxet - a protein that is common in various types of cancer and then reinvented.
A tested vaccine has promising effects in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the problematic cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the patient's extraction of immunocytes, their modification to the laboratory so that they can re-examine a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Ja Berzovski, from the US National Cancer Institute in Maryland Bethesda, said: “The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands...
As Professor Berzovski explained, HER2 protein is the driving force behind the development of several types of cancer -- such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lungs and fat bowel.
A similar approach in which immunocytes are extracted from patients and are then Treated - how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kane West defended Trump's, wearing a hat with the MGA's motto, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kaye West was disapproved in the studio during a Saturnday Night Live after an interrogated interview with US President Donald Trump who said he was going to run a candidate for the elections in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again (Leave America great again), he gave resilience to the Democratics and reiterated his support to Trump.
- A lot of times I'm talking to a white man and he says to me, - How do you like Trump?
If racism were to worry me, I'd have been out of America for a long time, he said.
SNL opened a sketch at which Matt Damon, with Hollywood's star dividing Bret Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Cristine Blasie Ford's alleged sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's delirium went up to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to dismantle West by means of this suspension.
Also, West protested to the public that he wasn't being treated well in the background because of his hat.
- I got bowling in the background.
They said, R-Don't go out with the hat--
They made me bowling!
And they say that I don't know what I'm doing-- he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: - I don't know what I'm doing? I'm gonna wear the superman cap, why so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love —
His comments were disapproved at least twice by the public and SNL factors seemed to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with a person saying in the magazine: \"In the entire studio there was a dead silence,
West was called as a replacement for the last moment of the singer Ariana Grant, whose ex-boyfriend, Ruper McMiller, had survived a few days earlier.
West mistaken several when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West argued to Kadas Terner, head of the TPUSA conservative team, which tweeted: -Towards one of the courageous spirits: IN THE WORLD REALLY WAS BEFORE THERE
However, the show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just himself and that's wonderful.
- But I choose not to reward someone ( buying his music or clothes or supporting Rotech) who believes that he is ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we -- she added.
Prior to the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now the one who was previously known as Kane West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Deddy's steps, also known as Pafe Dandi, Pafi and P. Deddy.
Raper Snoop Dog had changed his name to Snoop Lyon and of course the music legend Before had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince (The artist once known as Pres.).

Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, criticizes toxic indifference
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Rhymson John Snow in the violent medieval series of HBO, the Game of Thrones.
However, the actress, 31 years old, is judging the stereotype of a mass hero, saying that these roles in the screen go through to small boys the message that it should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking of The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that Rit goes wrong; and he wondered how to fight the problem of toxic irrigation in #MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married his co-star at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having a strong view of the matter.
Where did we make the mistake with maternity?
- What do we learn to men as they grow, about the problem we see now?
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic indifference due to the male promising characters.
Continue: - What is innate and what is being taught?
What is being taught on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they must display such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people.
In the interview he also admitted that he did not intend to play in a prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones after the end of the series next summer, saying: Rest in the battles and horses;
Since November, Kit will be staring at the revival of Sam Sheppard's True West project, which tells the story of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a robber.

The couple married in June 2018 to Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
In their vast majority, new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus was rapidly spread to some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV was almost zeroed, as Chinese health sector leaders said at a conference in Yoon province.
However, compared to last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men with sexual intercourses with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to drugs against HIV, in an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters forfeiting that strain leaked Republican senator data, condemns Reciprocal lies -- and conspiracy testicles --
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters has discredited claims that a member of her staff has posted personal information from three Republican senatories on the Wikipedia pages of the law.
Los Angeles' Democratic Member argued that the claims were promoted by Racra's commentators and websites on the right;
lies, lies, and even more terrible lies -- Walters referred to her statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the residence addresses and the phone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham, South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Houts, Utah.
The information was displayed on the Internet on Thursday and appears to be published by an unknown person in the environment of Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Committee on alleged sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as the Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifys the source of nights was associated with the Water Office and published the details of a member of Water's staff, said The Hill.
- This unfounded claim is completely unrealistic and flagrant lie - continued Waters.
The staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false claims, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely unsatisfactory and flagrant lie;
Water's statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleiser.
- This disdain is full of anger, Fleiser wrote.
This shows that he does not have the courage to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't be impertinent.
He must not question the motives of the man who blames him.
He must be calm and peaceful;
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats about Judge Kavano, who was accused by his critics that he seemed very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, candidate of the Republicans seeking to depress Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
- It's huge if it's real-- tweeted.
In her statement, Walters stated that her office had notified the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations;
- We will do everything to find the responsible -- continued, - and account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for any and all of my staff;
Criticality of the film O Johnny English Recurring - a subtonic spying film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film of British character, and this seems to be true in this revival of franchise action films with heroes from Johnny Inglis, which started in 2003 with the Johnny English film and came back in 2011 with the Johnny English film: The Return.
Can this humiliating self-satisfaction be about how obvious we are to become the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Inglis with the purled eyes could renew his license to do it handkerchief for the second time. His name states that it is a wider comical creation designed for non-English-language cinematographic spectators.
It is, of course, the anointed secret agent who, while pretending to have the glow and ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of Rothyris Bin -- and something from the guy who played a single note on the musical topic of the film The Roads of Fire at the beginning of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the traveler and international mysterious man who at one time has been impersonated by Atkinson in the most forgotten television advertisements of Barclaycard, soaring the chaos in his way.
There's one or two nice moments in this last JE movie.
I liked it when Johnny Inglis approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armour and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, humor is quite a subtonic and strange parasites, especially the moment that Reserres-embled franchises such as 007 and Dangerous Send now include several comic elements.
Humore seems to be talking to children rather than adults and, in my opinion, Johnny Inglis' mad steaks aren't as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's escaping shells for Bin's walk.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyber-haker has penetrated the super secret online spy network in Britain, making the identity of all the agents in Britain who are on mission, to the greatest disappointment of the agent in service, who is suspected by Kevin Eldon, to a unfortunately small role for his optimization.
It is the last drop for a prostitute and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse due to political complacency: Emma Thompson is doing the best with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario is not very helpful.
Information advisers inform her that, as every active spy has been revealed, it should bring back a detachable person.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who now works as director at a master of a master's school, but gives informal courses for secret agents: here there are some nice scenes, as Inglis offers an academia of spy type A School of Very Rock.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for urgent information and rejoins with Buff's former and passive partner, which Ben Miller's retreated.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role to which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin of the Globe for His Majesty's Secret Service are returning to action, meeting the beautiful and fatal benefits of Bouletova, which Olga Kirilenko suspects.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously excited by the gifted billionaire technology that claims to solve Britain's technological suffering: the threatening Jason Volta, which Jake Lacey is likely to solve.
Inglis and Buff begin their odyssey: disguised as waiters, set fire in a chilled French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to board illegally the luxury yacht of Volta, and Inglis causes anarchy as it attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize themselves with Volta's home.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and pheasant as they are, it continues to remind a little bit of child television.
Medium things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really will grow up with his talent?
Workmates say they're considering a plan to work for the British four-day, but to be paid for five-days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to look at a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for a five-day job.
The party, according to information, seeks the company's bosses to channel the savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AAA) to employees, giving them an extra free day.
Thus, employees will enjoy three days of a weekend without a reduction in their wages.
Sources state that the idea is in line with the economic agenda and the party's plans in order to return the scale for workers.
The change in a four-day week was approved by the Labour Association Congress as a way of benefiting workers from the changing economy.
Top source from the Labour Party told the newspaper The Sunday Times: - It is expected to announce a policy change before the end of the year.
-It will not happen in one night, but the four-day working week is a ambition aligned with the party's approach to re-balance the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's overall strategy for industry;
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general electoral campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the working party.
Labour Party spokesman stated: \"The four-day working week is not party politics and is not addressed by party;
The secretary of the shadow government, John McDonnell, used the Works conference last week to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from the Russian spokesman directors -- and the Rokerdoskophos -- to the state of general interest.
The drawings of the secretary of the shadow government also mean that today's shareholders in water supply companies may not take their entire share back, as a potential Labour Government could take up repercussions - because of suspected irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans for the placement of employees to the boards of companies and the creation of mutual funds for participation in order to give 10% of private sector companies to officials who will receive annual dividends of up to 500 acres of England.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking to the 60-Minutes show about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bret Cavano delayed his final vote on the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the service could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview with him on Sunday, Scott Peley, a 60-Minute correspondent, asked the Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could undo anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
- Yes, it's true. Kennedy said.
- I said by going to the hearing, I talked to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly: \"Did you do it?\"
He was immovable, determined, accusing --
However, Graham's vote seems not to change.
- I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and I'm gonna need an explosive charge to change my mind - he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it; he added Graham, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
- And whoever has named it, he can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new to change.
What is Global Citezen Festival and how much has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the eradication of world poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are planned to shrink to the Great Lawn of Central Park in the context of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi Bey and Son Menad, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of active fighters against it.
To ensure free ticket to the event (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or actions — as volunteers would say, send an email to a world leader, telephone or find other substantial ways to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while still 12 years are left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert the right way to persuade our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called Rclikativism - when some feel they actually make the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million Effects -- than its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped the leaders of the world to announce commitments and policies that correspond to more than 37 billion dollars, which are going to affect the lives of over 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least EUR 10 billion have already been disbursed or concentrated.
The group estimates that secured funds have so far directly influenced nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and realisers, who have made a commitment - help children fully exploit their potential - promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
- With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community such as you, we can make the social injustice of hyposimism a footnote in history - says Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following the 5,000 actions which the UK called on to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced to finance a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, addressed to 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In answer to the question - what makes you think that we can eliminate extreme poverty? - included in the frequent questions of the website,
A member of the Global Citizen responded: the road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the major movements on human rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we unite more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Menda, Cardi Bey and Janelle Monasteries are some of the artists who will appear in this year's New York edition, which will be presented by Deborah-Li Farnes and Hughe Jakman.
U.S.A. can use the civil Navy for Radical Exclusion — preventing Russia's exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington can turn — if needed — to its Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from being placed on the markets, including the Middle East, as the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, where he is acting on the invitation from the legitimate government, is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
I think the reasons why the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and southern Europe, are saying according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
The United States has the possibility, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that the Russian energy will not be placed on the market — he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees in an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group characterised by the Energy Consumer's Prayer - in the United States.
It compared Washington's approaches to address Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, briefly, the utilization and replacement of fuels - he told Russia about the characterisation of Ronnie that only knows one trick - as he has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made as Trump's administration has undertaken to strengthen the exports of American liquefied gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the most cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Rack to work for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that, according to Trump, will make Berlin's Rachamulato, Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is going to double the existing pipeline capacity in 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's firm resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want to choose; Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has caused Germany's reaction, which emphasised its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
- I have a major problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply - said Dter Kebf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider any candidate for the Presidency in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday he would seriously consider proposing a nomination for the presidency following the interim elections.
At a meeting in the Town Hall of Hollow Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility.
- It's time for women to go to Washington and rectify our problem government, and that's why a woman on the top said according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will examine the possibility of a nomination for the Presidium;
Warren criticised President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he's driving the country in the wrong direction.
I am so worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our republic, he said.
Warren didn't chew her words on Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that, of course, an FBI investigation before the vote is needed;
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that it should run for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the reef - Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run for him, according to a survey of the Superfolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% was in favour of such a candidacy.
The poll has shown more support for a possible nomination by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% being in favour of a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other popular names of the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible nomination for 2020 are of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Byden said he would have formally decided by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Track Palin's Metat Disorder at the Donald Trump Concentration
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruit in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening
-With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families who live with the effects of the Transtraumatic Stress Disorder and the injuries carried by our soldiers when they return home - he told the public in the context of a concentration for Donald Trump in Tulesa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a Rama bomb ready to explode, and she said about her son and other veterans that -- they return a little different, return harder, wonder if there is any respect for what soldiers have done for the country, the airborne and any other member of the army --
He was arrested on Monday in Gusila, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, referring to domestic violence and armedness while in drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Guisila police department.
18 states and the Columbia region support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region are supporting a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the region submitted an amicus curiae report on Friday in Washington supporting an asylum applicant to question the policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace against Session filed by the American Civil Liberties Association (American Civil Liberties Union) in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She stated that her mate, Ro and his violent sons who are members of a gang, however, abused US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
He was held in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which a large number of asylum seekers are coming from the United States as countries that have severe gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Committee of Appeals on Migration (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants leaving domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Prosecutor of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy Ragnes the entire decades of state, federal and international law;
In accordance with federal law, all requests for asylum must be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the request; such a breach infringes this principle — when reporting amicus curiae.
The lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy that refuses entry to migrants damages the US economy, highlighting the claim that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and be a necessary workforce;
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Session ordered the immigration cases to refrain from giving asylum to victims who are trying to escape situations of domestic violence and gangs.
The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political view; the Season stated in his statement of 11 June on politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to relieve all problems (even the most serious) faced by people daily around the world.
Renowned rescue efforts in Paphos, as the number of dead doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly getting worse.
- It's very intense - said the 35-year-old mother Riza Kosuma, trying to relieve her baby that had fever in an evacuation centre that was set up in the damaged city of Palau.
- Every minute, the ambulances bring other bodies.
The fresh water is sorghum;
Some residents tried to return to their damaged homes and gather their belongings through the waters, trying to salvage what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-range earthquake in Richter, were unable to meet the needs.
Some injured, such as Duy Harris, who suffered a fracture of the middle and shoulder, stayed out of the Palos Army Hospital, where the first aids were given to the countryside because of the continuing strong transfusions.
tears flooded his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake to shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel sharing with his wife and daughter.
- There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the wall -- Harris said in Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
- I heard my wife yelling for help, but then she prevailed silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe --
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for Rephericism -- with Propaganda Advertisements --
A week after official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a daily US newspaper overshadowing the mutual commercial benefits between the USA and China, US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to disperse its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the payment of China Daily's enclosure, which appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Haiova, after accusing China that it seeks to be involved in the Congress elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to get involved in the American elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it is a new phase of the escalated campaign that Washington has evacuated to put pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited by foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalated trade war and have imposed reciprocally different import duties.
The Chinese tariff retaliatory at the beginning of trade war aimed at hitting exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, reported Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brandstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of a long term term in Iowa, a state that is an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit the workers, farmers and US enterprises.
China, as Brandon wrote in an opinion article on Sunday Des Moines Register, has been handed over to this kind of intimidation by posting pre-marital ads in our free press --
In the effort to spread this propaganda, the Government of China exploits the valuable tradition of freedom of speech and of the free press of America, posting on payment advertising in Des Moines Register — was branded.
In the Beijing pavilion, you will find little different voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are under the control of China’s Communist Party -- he wrote.
He added that Rome of China’s most important newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article, although he did not reveal which.
The Republicans alienate women voters in the face of intermediate elections because of the fiasco with Cavano, the analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Brett Cavano Supreme Court despite complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially by women in the next interim elections.
The sentiments on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have said that they would like to move forward with the vote.
These things can't be restored - Grant Rier, professor of Political Science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill, about an article published on Saturday.
Ryer doubts that the move of Senator Jeff Fleik's last moment to ask for investigation from the FBI will be enough to attract an angry voter.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget about it tomorrow, and they will certainly not forget it in November; Karin Jean-Pierre said on Friday, the senior consultant and national spokesperson of the MoveOn progressive group, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters were bragging the motto -November - in the Senate corridor as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee gave the green light for the candidacy of Cavano, despite Dr. Christine Blazi Ford's testimony, Mic said.
The excitement and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels -- Stu Rodeberg said, a endless political analyst, on the news site.
They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of indebted women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who, while opposed the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described in detail her complaints about sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court, the analysts had predicted that there might be a reaction if the Republicans proceed with the anointing.
- It's a huge chaos for the Republican Party - Michael Steel said, former chairman of the National Republican Commission, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about the vote in committee or the final vote or about whether Kavano will be put out. It has to do with how the Republicans handled the matter and how he was brought to her - Guy Sesil, director of the USA Priorities Group to help with the election of the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Fort and Kavano's deposits, slightly more in favour of the second.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said she definitely or probably believed Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied to his statement, while just 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Fleik's move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford's complaints and at least one more complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Last week, Ford filed an oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavano attacked her when she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her genitals when they were at a party when they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Historian plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berner's Lee, the world's inventor, begins a startup in order to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new powder of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on the open platform Solids of Berners Lee.
Solid platform allows users to choose where to store their data, as well as who will be able to access and to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berner's Lee was joking that the intention behind Inrupt is PGC sovereignty --
- We have to do it now - he said about the statup.
- It's a historic moment.\"
The application uses the Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own personal computer data storage area — or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, desk lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify being all available in a browser and all of this at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal electronic data storage area is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this possibility — personal empowerment via data —
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is composed of Berner's Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of contracted programmers who worked in the project and a community of volunteers coded.
From this week on, technology programmers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berner's Lee said he and his team don't talk to Rhodes Facebook and Google about whether to make radical changes, overthrowing business models in one night.
- We're not asking for permission.
In a post in Medium released Saturday, Berners Li wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of the Solid platform --
In 1994, Berner's Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute (MIT).
In recent months, Berner's Lee has been a strong voice in the conversation about Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berner's Lee will remain the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
- I am extremely optimistic for the next era of the Internet - Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: Price Tax in a clergyman who received Victoria Cross in World War I
The unique clergyman of the Anglican Church who has received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Deputy Colonel Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had seconded the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday they became the revelation of a commemorative plaque by his two grandsons, accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said they were highly symbolic -- the plaque’s revealing was made just 100 years after his grandfather’s heroic act for which the medal was taken.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Van led his order to the Canal of Saint-Kenten in a very dense fog while he was getting powerful fires from combat weapons and machine guns;
Later, he rushed into the front line and with Dexual Male -- led the line forward before he hit himself with a three-mile weapon.
Col. Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said his grandfather's heroic deeds were Roth that I know I could never get there, is something that makes you feel unrestricted,
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wreath after the parade led by the friendly young Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van stated that he was given a great honor to participate in the parade, and added that the maid of a genuine hero proves by the support he has of many people;
MMA fans were updated to attend the Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Wurunaki.
Think of the following scenario: you are late to watch the fascinating Bellator 206, but you are deprived of the joy of seeing this unique sport event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six in main card, and would be shown live in the UK by Channel 5 in the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Musicsey and Rory McDonald were about to get into the ring, the spectators in the United Kingdom remained syllable when the show changed to Pepa the Grunaki.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the first morning hours for the game.
A Twitter fan described the show of the children's program as a Root of a sick joke;
In accordance with the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6:00 in the morning, so the children's programme had to be presented; it said Dave Schwarts, the senior vice president of marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
Pepsa the Warnaki, in fact...
The President of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were going to work on the programme to include UK spectators in the future.
- If we think about the rolls, I think we can do it-- Coker said.
- But there's 6:00 a.m. Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it by Sunday, or Monday.
But we're trying it out.
Believe me, when the change took place, a lot of forward and no friendly messages were exchanged.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you that next time this is not going to happen.
We'll limit it to the five struggles instead of for six, as we usually do. We've tried to offer more to the lamps and bypassed it.
It's an unpleasant situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has felt a lowly, because of his sexuality.
Olympiac in diving, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling less than the others because of his sexuality, however, he encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school, he wasn't all like me.
Speaking to the first Desert Island Discs presented by Loren Lavern at Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give the others Repelpida-
He also said that since he became a parent, he has been less interested in a victory in the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the known radio broadcast, was on a disease-free basis for several months.
As invited to Lavern's first show, Daley said that he felt reckless -- compared to others when he grew up, because he wasn't so socially acceptable to anyone and the boys and the girls--
He said: \"Mahri and today, these feelings of infertility and diversity gave me the strength and will to succeed\"
He wanted to prove that he was a rocket, he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally knew about his sexuality.
The two times bronze Olympianikos is a superb defender of the rights of the LGBTKI community and took part in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to proceed to the decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak, because he was lucky to have lived openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give to others.
The three times world champion said it was a surprise -- when he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar Dustin Lastin Black, who was 20 years older, but argued that the age difference was never an issue.
- When you spend so much time at such a young age - (It was the first time in Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) - it is difficult to find a constitutive who has similar good and bad moments;
The couple took a son in June, Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said he changed his perspective.
- If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal. - He said.
But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
- I couldn't tell him, \"Dad, you won't be around us to sit in the front row\" - he said.
I used to hang his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible, he said.
The following year, Daley fought in the 2012 Olympics and won the copper medal.
- I knew it was all I dreamed of my whole life, fighting the diving of the Olympic Games in my homeland, there was no better feeling, - he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song, the Proud of Heather Small, who was attracted to him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and even gives him creeps.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts to BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The off-form Mickelson will sit on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will write a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time (number recorder) in the struggles organised every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furk to sit on the bench for the Fourballs and the Foursomes of Saturdays.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it is used to the United States, the five times the winner lasted the day to be amazed by the lines and to Rhodes -- his game hoping to correct his troubles.
Without having ever been the directst Driver even at the basement of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the narrow stadium of Le Golf National, where far too often are problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the court, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, is facing Francisco Molinari, the champion of British Open, who works with the first-time ensuing Tommy Flitwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the beginning of the 12 singles, can get the lead with a good start, Mickelson's game can be critical.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
- He fully understood the role he played today, hit me friendlyly on the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow-- Furick said.
- He's got a lot of confidence.
His name is in Hall of Fame and has offered too much to these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we had to go.
He wants to get out there, like everyone else--
Mickelson is going to get over Nick Faldo's record for most of the Sunday matches in the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that didn't get to the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half, although Furice said his presence had benefits for the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make plates and he's excellent in the group's room, he explained.
I think younger players would also enjoy being teased this week.
His contribution isn't just in the game --
The leader of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big head can soon be lost
Thomas Byorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a big head starts from last day's singles to the Ryder Cup can easily be converted into defeat.
The Dane did his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team head of Sheve Ballesteros managed to gain five degrees over the Americans, but just when he managed to pass the final line with a boob difference, winning 141-2-132.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big head start in Valderrama, we had a big head start in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just barely-- Byorn said, in the picture, after watching the generation of 2018 wins 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show to me and all members of the team that this is not over.
We're going all done tomorrow to give it all.
We'll go out there and play right.
Nothing's over until you see the grades in the painting.
We've got a target to win this trophy, and that's where we're focused.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know very well that in the other team there are just as good players - the best in the world --
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Byorne adds: -I wouldn't be in such a hurry to precipitate the result.
Tomorrow's another beast.
Tomorrow's what counts individual performance, and that's something different.
It's wonderful to be on the field with a composer when things are doing well, but when you're out there on your own, then you're trying to top your skills as a golf player.
This is the message that you need to pass on to the players, how to get their best of themselves out tomorrow.
You leave your teammate back and we need him to give it all up and show his best shot at it.
Unlike Biorne, Jim Furick from the rival team will ask his players to have better personal performance than they had with their teammates, except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three points.
Furice himself has experienced both the extremes of the overthrows of the last day, as he belonged to the victorious team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
I remember every ramble of his word -- he replied when asked how Ben Crensha, the leader in 1999, had smashed his players for the last day.
We have 12 major games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like Medinah.
When we get this momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the intermediate struggles.
We decide on our order accordingly and play with the order that suits us, we will try to make our magic tomorrow
Thomas has undertaken to lead the race and faces Rory McKillroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the series.
- I went with this group in this order because I think it covers the whole route - Bjorn said, justifying his choices for singles.
New postponement for the new German warship
The new German Navy franchise should have been put on duty in 2014, to replace the ageing warships of the cold-war age, but they will not be taken until next year, at least because of defective systems and the costs to be incurred, say local means.
The post at the service of the French franc Rheinland-Pfalz, the ship commander of the brand-new francs class Baden-Wuertemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which invokes a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with delivery have been decisive for the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships classed Baden-Wuerttemberg that ordered the War Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen fugitives.
They will carry a strong cannon, a series of anti-air missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as new francs can be used for up to two years outside German ports.
However, constant delays mean that although warships are considered to be the last technology that will enable Germany to show its power abroad until it is finally put to service, it will already be over, notes Die Zeit.
The poor F125 franchise became headline last year when the German Navy officially refused to pick up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship after delivery.
There have not been much known information on the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of important faults with software and hardware -- which would have been unusable by the warship, if used in a battle mission.
The problems of the software were particularly important. As the ships of class Baden-Wuertemberg have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of it compared to the oldest Bremen fugitives.
It was also revealed that the ship has much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be twice as high as the ships of similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from defective equipment, the cost for the whole project (including crew training) has also been a matter.
It is said that it reached the mere figure of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) and the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems faced by new francs are particularly important since Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament defensive committee, admitted that the Navy will soon have no ships for missions;
The official said that the problem was increasing over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but there are no more ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fugitives could join the Navy.
National Trust hides the secret lives of bats
New survey conducted on a land in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting their food.
The findings will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the design of future environmental protection actions.
The study by National Trust scientists for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nannyter and hood, as well as the octopus café and the Dobenton nest in the Invewe Gardens gardens, at the Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all records by experts will verify the frequency of bat calls, as well as which kinds have this behaviour.
Then there will be a map of the habitat and a report to develop a detailed picture of their local behaviour.
Rob Duar, Adviser for the Natural Environment Protection for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which sites of the habitat are more important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of biotopes, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the whole United Kingdom have decreased significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by building work and development projects that affect the places where they surf and destroy their living areas.
Steam generators and lighting also present a risk, as well as adhesive strips for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because they chase at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their hunting.
They're using an advanced soundtrack technique to detect insects and obstacles in their flight course.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers nights very important.
It has ten trained experts who conduct regular investigations inspecting the places where bats are tired and sometimes rescued.
The organization has also created the first and only shelter in Scotland exclusively for bats in the Threve estate, Dafris and Galloway, where they live eight of the ten kinds of bats in Scotland.
The land manager, David Thompson, states that the estate is the ideal ground for bats.
-Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats - he said.
We have old buildings, many large trees and an ideal habitat.
There's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here but elsewhere will help us get better to understand what they need to raise their populations.
Points out that it is important to first check for bats before each maintenance work in residentials, as the destruction of a single nest with small one could kill up to 400 female and small, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and are prohibited from killing them, harassing them or disturbing their quiet, or destroying their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, member of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said, \"We have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our kinds simply do not know about the evolution of their population...\"
Ronalto refuses complaints of rape, as his lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Renalto described the complaints of rape against him as Rofake News; saying that some Renault want to be self-imposed — taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The aggression of National Portugal and Yuventus is accused of raped by an American named Catherine Mayorga in the room of a Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
According to the complaint, she allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking of a live video at Instagram in his 142 million followers, Ronalto, 33 years old, characterised the Refake News Reports --
- No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news -- said the five times the Golden Ball winner on camera.
They want to self-protected and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine -- the player added smiling.
Rhealto's lawyers are preparing to sue Deer Spiegel for the allegations he made, which they described as a Reaper report of reputations touching private life - according to Reuters.
Cristian Skerch said the player will seek compensation for Rethymmetric damage of the seriousness of the breach, probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years;
The alleged incident is said to have happened in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After their acquaintance at a nightclub, Ronalto and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where she was alleged to have raped despite nature according to documents submitted to the City Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronalto fell into the knees after the alleged incident and told her that it was against a 99 percent -- a Ralk guy -- but he betrayed the other Ronalto.
The papers say that Ronalto admits they had sexual intercourse, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to an unjustified settlement, because she feared the possibility of counter-existence -- and was concerned about her Roman humiliation --.
34-year-old says she's trying to overturn the settlement, as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome because of the alleged incident.
Ronalto was on the verge of transferring to Real Madrid from Manchester Juunitt at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to the Italian Juventus, ensuring an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will regret the loss of motor vehicles
The United Kingdom - will forever regret - if he loses his reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was Rary - that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
We need a deal; Mr Clark said.
The Japanese car industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where the models Auris and Avensis of Toyota produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, from which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in late March, production will be stopped in our factory, Marvin Cook said, Toyota CEO in Bernaston said.
Other automotive industries in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of exit from the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to risks in the supply chain according to the automotive industries in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line follows just-in-time. The spare parts reach every 37 minutes by suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on request.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a lack of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep out of stock beyond one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU was in particular attempting to resolve the issue of cross-border controls;
We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity; said to the BBC Radio Today show 4.
The data that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is essential to ensure continuity of supply chains;
Toyota was unable to say how diamonds would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional cost would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsukalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been Unitede's trade union officer at the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: -From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
Government spokesman said: We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU;
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, announces the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be finalized another week -- as the dispute is continuing for the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Inquisitor Robert Muller, who is investigating Russian intervention in the elections, Tub's aid links with Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump would fire the deputy Attorney General, endangering Mueller's independence, fuels Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a wire in order to record his talks with Trump and allow the President to be removed on the basis of 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then held at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting delayed in not complicating with the hearing before the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs in which Kavano and one of the women accused of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford filed.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week about claims against Kavano, thus delaying the vote by the Senate Plenary.
Sarah Sanders, a Tub press spokesman, appeared on Fox News Sunday TV show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: \"There is no yet a date, maybe this week, but perhaps another week will be passed on from all other cases concerned by the highest court.
But we'll see, after all, I like to always inform the press...
Some journalists objected to this claim: Sanders has to make press briefing at the White House since 10 September.
The anchor Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of updates was not due to misery to the Redemption movement of television journalists, although he stated: -I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown -
Then let it mean that it would increase or direct communication between Trump and the press.
The President gives more interviews than any previous president, he said, adding without giving any evidence: we looked at these numbers;
There will continue to be briefings, said Sanders, but if the press is able to address questions directly to the President of the United States, this is inconceivable better than talking to me.
We are trying to implement it often and you have seen that we have often applied it over the past few weeks and will take the press release where you will be able to speak to the President of the United States.
Trump often asks questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Individual type interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and biasing appearance before centralised journalists.
The Minister for Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System via Brexit fears
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain after the United Kingdom has left the European Union.
Gene Friman, Member of Scotland, sent a letter while less than six months were left to leave the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of requesting a permanent resident status (Psettled status) for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Friman wrote in her letter: - During the summer negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal and are heading for expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of non-accordance.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each official regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here--
Christon Abercrobi is undergoing emergency surgery following a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrobi was subjected to emergency surgery after a head injury where Tennessee State Tigers were defeated by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as posted by newspaper journalist Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reid's main coach told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-year-old.
- He came to the counter and just collapsed there - Reid said.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercroby oxygen to the counter and then put him in a truck and transferred him back for further evaluation.
A tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV TV station in Nasville, Tennessee State, that Abercroby got out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added there are still no data on the type/expansion of the injury; and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, a second-year student under limited participation status (Redshirt), travels his first season to Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made five talents in total, on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching 18 taclins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged at a higher rate of paper on the acquisition of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged at a higher rate of paper on the acquisition of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will be used to assist homeless, according to new Tori projects.
The measure will eliminate Corbin's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the paper fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects to gather up to 120 million UK pounds a year - to help the unscrupulous people.
Foreign buyers will start to impose a higher paper charge on the acquisition of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will be used to assist the unscrupulous ones, as Teresa May will be announced today.
The measure will be regarded as an attempt to eliminate the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more economic housing and to target high-paid people.
The increase in the paper fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will enhance the government's campaign to combat housing shortage.
The surcharge, imposed at the current paper fee, together with the higher tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second residences and dwellings for rent, may be 3 per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to generate up to DKR 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly-built real estate in London are purchased by people not resident in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for purchasers to enter the first home market.
Many wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become towns-bangs - because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend their most time outside the country.
New policy is introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the paper fee so that more young people can have their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of holding the prices of real estate high, gaining land without, however, using and inviting Ms. May to remove plaques into economic homes in order to restore the Rostagic trivial tribulation — Britain.
Mr Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms including rent controls and a ban on landfills;
He also wishes to give greater powers to the councils in order to build new houses.
Mrs. May said that I would devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for each new generation.
This means repairing the broken property market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, to work and to build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and foreign-based companies to buy homes as easily as hard as hard-working British nationals.
For too many people the dream of property has now become very distant and the undignifiedness of housing shortage remains exist.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to train the Scottish team --
Sanderland's leader, Jack Ross, says that his absolute ambition is to become the coach of the Scottish National Team at some point.
42-year-old Scots are excited with the challenge of resurrecting the group of North-East England, which is currently in the third place in the Class of England's Football Category (League One), three degrees below the top.
He moved to Light Stadium in summer, after returning St. Miren to the Scottish Championship of the previous race season.
I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team, and this was- Ross told the Scottish BBC on Sportsound radio show.
- But I grew up watching the Scottish team in Habden all the time with my dad as a child, and that's something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have a success in group training;
Among Ross' predecessors in Sanderland are Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paul Di Kane.
The former coach of Aloa Athletics reports that he was not feeling awe when he was called to take so well established names into such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipsch Town.
- Is this the success for me to be measured on the basis of the answer to the question - can I bring this team back to Premier Ligg?
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it definitely belongs to Premier Lig R said.
-It's not an easy job to get to there, but I'm probably gonna consider myself successful here only if I can bring the team back there.
Ross started his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a while as an assistant coach in Dabarton and a 15-month interval on Hart's coaching staff.
Then it helped Aloa come back from subjugation to the third category and led St Miren from the lip of the subjugation to conquer the Championship the next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartblel, Folkerk, St Miren and Hamilton Acadamal.
It was probably a real crossroads -- he said, reminding us of the position of coach Aloa.
I really believed that I could be a coach more than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making decent money out of it, and I had reached quite high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having difficulties with the stress and pressure of work, but my coach's work fits perfectly.
I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've felt with myself all my adult life.
You can hear the entire Sportsound interview on Sunday 30 September, Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time
The best time to beer is at 5.30 pm Saturdays, according to investigation.
The summer burner strengthened the profits for Britain's tested pubs but brought more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 per cent, as the numbers revealed.
Peter Martin, from CGA's counsellor company, who gathered the data, said: “The continuous sunshine and the greatest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with last month, in June, where pub's profits increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even greater blow.
The reduction of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenue in June merely worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that serve alcohol made them much better, with the corresponding data from previous years upwards as the corresponding data from restaurants fell.
The pubs serving food also suffered sunny days, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all manageable pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent;
Paul Newman, from RSM's recreational and hospitality analysts, said: -These results verify the trend we found since the end of April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting events remain the greatest factors in terms of sales to the outside market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to find difficulty, but the drop in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have occurred at a worse time for businessmen in the catering area and time will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a long-lasting extension;
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade names.
The sales index Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK Pub, bars and restaurants collects and analyses profitability data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of more than 9 million UK pounds and is the established point of reference of the industry.

Eilid Doyle will be the athletes' Rance -- at the Scottish Race Board.
Eilid Doyle was elected as non-executive advisor to the Scottish Council at the annual general meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most promising Scottish stroller and President Ian Bitti commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from its extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
- Eilid enjoys infinite respect throughout the entire Scottish, British and global track community and we're sure that the Scottish track in Scotland will have a huge benefit from her entrance to the council - Betty said.
Doyle said, \"I'm excited to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help to guiding the sport in Scotland\"

Pupil advertising that compares mothers with cows disperse online public opinion
A mammals producer has divided online opinion with an advertisement comparing mothers who are sucking on herds.
In order to locate the assumption of the so-called World Restless and Build Trainer, the consumer technology company Elvie released a humorist advertising inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom offered to breast-feed mothers the new puncture.
Four real mothers dance within a barn of cows full of hay, with a song that includes lyrics such as: - Yes, I take myself away, but you don't see any tails; and - If you didn't notice it, these are not breasts, they are my tits;
The chorus continues: - Pull it, pump it, feed babies, draw it, draw it, draw it, take care of my ladies.
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised online confrontation.
With 77,000 shows and hundreds of comments, the video has taken mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it does not take Rofriki — the milk industry seriously.
-Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies steal them a few days after birth; someone commented.
Elvie's nipple fits discreetly into a nursing bra (Elvie/Meater)
Someone else commented: - seemly traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise mothers for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: - An advertisement entirely out of reality --
Others defended the ad, while a woman admitted that her song seemed Rexcardic --
- I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a pedestrian if I was still hungry.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I haven't been able to over-analyse it.
It's a brilliant product -- someone wrote.
Another commented: It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who draw breast milk (commonly at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not a trade advertising that praises or criticises the milk industry;
At the end of the video, the team of women reveals that they all danced with the discreet pedestrians in their brass.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who draw breast milk with a hunter say they feel like cows.
The Elvie nurse, however, is completely silent, has no cables, no tubes, and separates discreetly into a brass, allowing women to move, keep their babies and even get out during the pumping.
Anna Balarien, a collaborative and executive director of creative in Mother, commented: “The Elvie native is such a revolutionary product worth a bold and provocative lansamentation.
By making a parallel between the nursing women and the dairy cows, we wanted to put the focus on raising breast milk and all its challenges, while at the same time showing in a fun and related way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new hunter will bring.
It's not the first time that the Elvie mall becomes a front page.
During London's Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the passarella for the fashion designer Marta Yakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children fled quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of persons in detention has reached heights, although monthly border disputes have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to match children with dependants.
Traditionally, most keepers are themselves immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to go ahead and ask for a child and thus endanger their own possibility of staying in the country.
The risk was intensified in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential conservers and other adult members of their household should give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior official of the Immigration and Customs Department, testified before Congress that the agency had captured dozens of people who claimed to maintain unaccompanied minors.
Later the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had a white criminal record.
Roughly 80 percent of those who are either sustainers or members of the caretaker household are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to pursue these individuals; Mr Albens said.
By targeting a quicker handling of child cases, the responsible have introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before court within one month of the beginning of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously applicable, according to workers in shelters.
Many will appear by means of a dactyloscopy, in the position of self-personal appearance, in order to develop their claims for a legal regime before the judiciary responsible for immigration.
Those who consider that they do not fulfil the conditions for exemption will be expelled immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely it is to get nervous or distressed, which can lead to violent breaks or escape attempts, according to the workers in shelters and reports that have been taken out of the system in recent months.
The lawyers said that these concerns are increased to higher facilities such as Tornijo, where the indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely to be unconscious due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children into the tent without giving sufficient time to prepare children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends may exacerbate the trauma with which they are already struggling.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish Governments to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces are illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and -- they will be treated properly --
They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally; they told the convention.
Mullem insisted that the war against terrorism is almost over - in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been thrown out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue Rena gives this sacred battle until we kick all Syrian terrorists out of both terrorist groups and every illegal foreign presence --
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the country destroyed by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions are good for their return and accused Restricted Western countries - about the Perseverance of inconsistent fears - that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these refunds - he said.
They are making a political issue that should be purely humanitarian;
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria if no political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarised zone in the last major fortification of the rebels in Idlib created the opportunity to promote political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extended attack by Russian-speaking Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had Russian deadlines -- and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including the warriors associated with Al-Qaida Front Newsra, who would be dismantled;
UN special envoy Staphan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for the elections.
Mullem set the conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be restricted - in the revision of the articles of the current Constitution - and warned that no interventions should be made.
'Cause Trump's gonna win a second term.
With this logic, Mr Trump will regain the 2020 elections unless, as probably hopes, many liberal spectators, the motion of censure and the scandals end his presidency early.
Something that would undoubtedly be - the most dramatic final of the presidency of all time!
So far, there are no signs of spectators tiredness.
Since 2014, high-temperature television numbers have been more than doubled, reaching 1.55 million to CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News TV averaged 2.4 million viewers in the high-television area, while four years ago it had 1,7 million, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's show-up, The Rachel Madddow Show -- has scanned the TV numbers on satellite TV, with 3.5 million TV viewers on important news nights.
It is a fire to which people are attracted because it is something we do not understand; Neal Baer said, producer of the dramatic ABC-Designed Survivor (Hunger of the Next Day) where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran writer comedy series and author of the book titled PJust the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club -- has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi journey to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her driver said she was going to vote for Mr Trump.
She asked, why?
- She said, \"Because she makes me laugh.\" - Mrs. Scovel told me.
You can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, contrary to what happens to television series, the scripts that come out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy vs. Wade case, if immigrants' families will be able to reinvent the health of the world economy.
The change of frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of informed citizen when you are for six hours to monitor a team of experts to discuss the use of a multitude of interviews in the background; by Bob Woodwood about his book -- (Rhovos), Paul's Bomber jacket of an ostrich skin worth $15,000 (Double tires full of hybrids) and the consequences of the glacial descriptions that Stormi Daniels made about Mr. Tramp's anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
- What he does and what makes you feel like the reality show is that he gives you something every night - said Brent Montgomery, CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the television project -Pawn Stars - about the constantly changing actors and the daily overturns in the plot of the Tramp performance (spring with N.F.L., praises Kim Young Won).
You don't have the luxury to lose an episode, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the northern coast of Cowai, but he was closed inside seeing MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn't unleash, not when Brett Kavano was going to attend the Senate Committee of Judicial Affairs and the future of the Supreme Court was hung by a thread.
I remember doing those crazy shows before and people would say that would mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization -- Mr. Flyz told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right at last...

Outside money infiltrates the most marginal resonance for intermediate elections
It is no surprise that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania in Congress receives a flow of money, thanks to the re-enactment of the election districts of Congress, which has set two active members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This newly-designed suburban region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected in another region in special elections last spring.
Lab has as an opponent another active representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the former 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which coincides largely with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a judgment by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which held in January that the old regions were manipulating anti-constitutional in favour of the Republican people.
The electoral reassessment in the new 17th constituency has launched a financial competition campaign between the largest financial parts of the parties, the Democratic Campaigns Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after reaching a boundary victory in a special election held in March, for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania in Congress, which was followed by a lot of people.
This post was held Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the region for 20 points.
Politic analysts give light to the Democrats.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, but did back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with Panama Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017, and he was maintaining a hotel in Panama until the associates had taken over the administration team of the Tramp.
The officials of the State Department decided to recall the Americans head of diplomatic missions by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the recent decisions no longer recognize Tavan -- as Heather Nauert, the press spokesman of the service said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were examined only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received almost USD 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The sanctions proposed, including reductions in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings developed, officials from North and Central America uploaded a high-tech conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, as a result of a corresponding concentration that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent refugees from going to the United States.
In the middle of September, however, senior management made it clear that they wanted to move the conference to an end, thereby putting an end to the allegations of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Penz is going to address the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance the concentration on administration, as the diplomats have said.
All three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr Bolton's spokesman for the White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next strike may be the report by Special Adviser Robert Muller on the decommissioning of justice by Mr Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is rumoured that Mr Muller also turns his investigation into the possibility of coexistence between the electoral campaign by Mr Trump and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr Trump will be accountable to this body, as he is preparing to reclaim the presidency in the next elections and perhaps ultimately before an oathing court.
Rahn-Rhan is a lot and I do not imply that the fall of Mr Trab, or his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that all of us need to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The age of history revolves around such a turning point and the intransigent course of democracy accelerates or slows.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr Trump dismisss Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Resenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he was written in that paper that last year he suggested that he should be recorded secretly and that he was considered inappropriate for the president’s position.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the version adopted by Times is inaccurate.
How do we answer whether the recently requested investigation by the F.B.I. about Bret Cavano is not complete or fair, or whether it is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the bare charges for sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress who will put Mr Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I took in the realm, I think we will not fail.
My mother was Czechoslovakian Jewish who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, migrated to America and 60 years later he sent me to light up candles of the Jewish Sabbath at that table with the swastika.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the fight with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain and Vijareal earlier this month, will give her many chances of qualification from the 7th Europa League Group.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season to the garlic of 2-2 with Viyareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a brain for greater successes.
- It was a good time for us because Viyareal is a good team -- the 31 year old man said.
We got into the game thinking we could achieve something and we got out to a certain degree.
Perhaps we could get away from the end, but, in general, the balance was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Welcome to things, we can take three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought a good result to their last game, but, with the world in the platform, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the group itself, but there is a positive sense now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let's hope that we can do our best now, leave behind last season and succeed.
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of pension saving
Although research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive treatment, few were discussing it with their family.
Almost half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they were discussing with their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken about this to their children.
People want to take care of them by their family, but they do not take any initiative to have this conversation -- said Holly Snider, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
Start this.
Speak to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term financial choices can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a takeover price to help you cover these costs or security with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a proxy on health care issues to define a trusted person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes if you are not able to contact.
Also, consider making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to take on your behalf decisions on financial matters and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you become helpless.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent faces an extraordinary health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Indicate these details in a written design so that you are ready.
- Aren't only the financials, but who are the doctors? - Martin asked.
- What's the drugs?

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications stopped, humanitarian aid forces have not managed to obtain information from Dongala, an area in the north of Paphos, which is closer to the centre of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In the Older than 16,000 people were removed after the outbreak of the disaster.
Here are some important data about Palou and Dongala on the island of Sulauzi:
Paphos is the capital of the province of central Sulauzi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulauzi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a counter-reference that extends along more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the island of Sulauzi.
The opposition, a tier of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main foundations of the Central Sulauzi economy and especially in the Dongala Sea region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is more found in Morulia, on the opposite coast of Sulauzi.
Palou and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Restoration Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Fire Fleet Seismo in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most recent earthquakes and tsunami are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on December 26, caused tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, while over half of them were in Acheh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead in the island of Nicara, near the shores of Sumatra.
2006: Reichter's magnification of 6.8 degrees hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing tsunami that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: a 7.6-degree earthquake of the Richter scale centred near Pandang city, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake of the River scale hit one of the Meditau islands, near Sumatra, causing a ten-mile tsunami, that destroyed dozens of villages and cost life to some 300 people.
2016: Low focal depth earthquake hit the Piddyja region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the destruction that the killing earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed from buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence.
Truck Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin was arrested for attack.
29-year-old Pylin, from Guysila, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect for domestic violence, obstructing a complaint for domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a woman's girlfriend attempted to call the police to denounce the crimes he allegedly committed, she grabbed her phone from her hands.
Palin is temporarily detained at the Mat-Su temporary reservation store with a guarantee of $500, as mentioned at the KTU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared Resigra, innocent -- when he was asked, as the network says.
Palin faces charges for three class A floods, which means that a sentence of $250,000 can be imposed on him by one year and a penalty of $250,000.
It is also accused of a category A flood, punished by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal proceedings are being persecuted against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before Alaska's Veterans' Court of Justice.
In January 2016, charges for domestic violence were imposed on him, obstructing a complaint on the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while in drunken state.
His partner claimed that he was bled to the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when it connected her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulauzi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake in the Richter scale caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been stopped, and the number of dead is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulauzi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The social media have been using videos since the time of the catastrophic event.
Hundreds of people gathered for a holiday on the beach in Palau when tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutors request the rarely imposed death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
Federal Prosecutors in New York demanding the death penalty on Saiflo Saipov, the suspect for the terrorist attack in New York, which cost the lives of eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, he's supposed to use a company's rental truck Home Depot to attack a bike along the West Side Avenue in Kato Manhattan, drifting pedestrians and cyclists found on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify condemnation to death, prosecutors should prove that Saipov killed the eight victims — with intention — and caused serious physical harm — in intention of saying the intention of enforcing the death penalty, which was deposited at the South District Court in New York, according to the statement of intention to impose the death penalty.
Both charges involve the death penalty, according to the same document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury body confronted Saipov with the indictment of 22 points of class, including eight charges for homicide for criminal organisation, a tactic commonly applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a charge for violence and destruction of automobile vehicles.
The attack called for Rational design and premeditation; the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov was attacked as a Reatropie, hard and grievous --
“Sifulo Habibulaevic Saiposov caused distress, damage and loss to the families and friends of the Diego Enrique Enrique Enhelini, Nikolas Clives, An-Lor Dekad, Daren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernaen Feruchi, Ernaen Diego Mentosa and Alekandro Damian Panukos, as stated in the statement of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been decades since the last time the South York District Court tried to prosecute a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Halind Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually a life sentence was imposed in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed for a federal federal case in New York was in 1953 for husbands of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being conspired for conspiracy for the execution of a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, seemed unrepentant during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the interrogators that he felt satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack by ISIS videos he saw on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to put the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, according to the police.
He's innocent about the 22 charges recorded in the indictment.
David Paton, one of the federal public lawyers representing Saipov, said they were Reaganly frustrated -- with the prosecutor's decision.
We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of acceptance of the guilt declaration for life sentences with no chance of release will merely extend the trauma caused by the events for all involved; Paton said.
The Saipooff defence team had previously called on prosecutors not to demand the imposition of a death penalty.
Member of the Tories says that YITZEL FATZ should be set head of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage sworn to rocket the populace army today during a protest gathering at the Tories conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party (UKIP) said the politicians had to challenge the pressure - by the Eurosceptics, as one of Teresa May's Members said he should be head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Boone told the protesters at Birmingham that the UK should have already come out - if Mr Farage was the Minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May is facing in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was highlighted by the fact that overseers of staying in EU Torris participated in a separate conflict of protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain the Chekers compromise project under control through attacks by Brexit defenders, EU and EU proponents.
The allies insisted on going ahead with its attempt to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and inducing Eurosceptics and Workers to choose between her package and Rechaos;
Mr. Boone said at the Lave Means Leave protest (Departure means Departure) in Solihal that he wanted to fly the Chekers project --
He said that a title of nobleness had been awarded to Mr Farage and his powers had been granted to negotiate with Brussels.
- If we were in charge, we'd already be gone now - he said.
The Member from Weddingboro added: I'll support Brexit but we need to throw the Checkers project.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight world wars to become miners.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Boun rejected the allegations that public opinion had been changed from the 2016 vote: -The guess that the British people have changed their minds and wanting to stay is completely inappropriate -
Brexit member of the Toris Andreas Jenkins was also in the protest and told journalists: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checkers project does not have the acceptance of the broad public, the Anti-Polivism will not vote for it, does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who are coming down to the streets and at the bottom of us are elected.
Please leave the Checkers Plan and begin to listen.
With a sharp message to Mrs May, he added: \"The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises\"
Mr Farage said in the protest that politicians must be forced to challenge the pressure - if they are prepared to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the class of our politicians - he said.
- They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them - we won't let you get away with it if you do this--
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the class of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We're recognizing this country's people's army that gave us victory with Brexit and we'll never be quiet until we're an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom --
Meanwhile, the proponents of staying in the EU protested in Birmingham before taking a two-hour gathering in the city center.
Few activists were rewarding Toris banner against Brexit after the team gathering this weekend.
A member of the Labour Lord Adonis flew the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with an application of the party at the start of the conference.
They are the same people who tell us that the information systems and all the technological means needed for the E.R. agreement with enrichment, the uninterrupted borders, free trade with frontiers in Ireland, have added.
- It's an absolute fiasco.
It does not mean good Brexit — he added.
Warren plans to take seriously the possibility of holding a candidate for the Presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider a candidate for the presidency following the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during a city hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticises President Donald Trump, claims to be re-election in November, with Republican State spokesperson Jeff Del, who co-founded the Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly thought that it can be reassessed with Trump in 2020.
The afternoon of Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters using the town hall structures since Trump's term started.
One compiled person asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren said it's time to go to Washington women to make our broken government, and that means a woman has to be on top of the ridge.
Synopsis about the deadly shooting of the LSU Simms basketball player
The police at Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the fatal shooting of the LSU Wade Simms basketballer on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyton Simpson, 20, at a press conference on 11am (Additional Time Zone).
They had posted a video of shooting Friday, asking for help in identifying the man shown in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot deadly near the Southern University area early on Friday.
- Wade Simms suffered a bullet wound in the head, which led to his death-- the police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports web.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the spot having possession of the gun and confessed that he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and is detained in the Eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
Three-year-old Sims student at a height of 1,98, who grew up in Baton Rouge played at 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a key player last season, with an average of 17,4 minutes, 5,6 points and 2,9 ribounds per match.
Gran Pri of Russia: Louis Hamilton goes for a world title, as the instructions of his team gave him victory over Sebastian Fedel.
It was clear from the moment that Valerie Botas walked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the game.
On the start, Botas had a good start, and he almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position on the first two curves and called Fetel to attack his oyster.
Fell went first and let Hamilton run in the tail of the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit a round later and came back from Fellel, but Hamilton went out front after a wheel with a wheel, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly abandon the internal cause of danger in the breach of the double movement to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstapen started from the last place and was seventh at the end of the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he remained first for a large part of the race, as he kept his tires, aiming to end quickly and move ahead from Kimi Raconen in the fourth position.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round, but he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raconen came fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valerie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team went great and did one-two-- Hamilton said.
The body language was so bad.
President Donald Trump flew Senator Diane Fainstein at a gathering on Saturday for her insistence that he did not leak Christine Blazi Ford's letter, in which he accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the statement that Ford gave before the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs, in fact commenting that the documents in the Senate proved that people are Russian-sucking and terrible and liars-
- The only thing that could also happen to this beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate in the last few days, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and ill-preserved and lousy and liars - he said.
When you see posts and leaks, and then they're telling you, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you're the one who broke the document-- oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it through.
Well, hold on a second.
No, we didn't break out... add a imitation of the senator.
Fainstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Kavano in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Finestein refused that the leak was made from her office.
- I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't break through her story, - Feinstein told the committee, as it says in the Hill newspaper.
He asked me to keep her classified and kept her classified as she asked me to.
But her denial did not seem particularly convinced by the president, who commented during the Saturday gathering: -I'll tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen--
Continuing defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women for sexual harassment, the president made it clear that the Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
They are determined to take power back by using any necessary means.
You see malignancy, sport, they don't care who they're hurting, who they have to trample to take power and control -- the president said according to the Mediaite news website.

Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of airplane passengers from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero, as he has lost his life in trying to ensure the safe take-off of an aeroplane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing because of a great earthquake hit by the Sulauzi island on Friday, causing tsunami.
Powerful migrations continue to affect the area and many have been trapped in pale in the city of Palau.
But, although his colleagues ran off to save their lives, the 21-year-old Antonio Guuan Agung refused to abandon his position in the control tower swept, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Paos.
He was in position to make sure that the 6321 flight of Batik Air, which was in the take-off corridor at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was falling down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Johannes Shiret said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as he transferred Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Bilipaban to Kalimandan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he got to Padu the helicopter.
- We're shocked about his death -- he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster response service says that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutong is limited.
The number of dead is believed to increase, as many bodies are still under ruins, and many of them we haven't managed to get them.
Waves that reached the six meters have destroyed Palou, who will finalize a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Resa Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News:Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water's too short.
Minimarkets are plundered everywhere.
Jean Gelphant, President of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said at CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What has happened is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Wido arrived in Palou on Sunday and told the country's army: PSAN, I ask you to work at the night to bring to an end any evacuation related work.
- Transfer CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which cost life to more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man is missing after an aircraft crash in a lake.
The airline that crashed on a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini has stated in a press release that since the afternoon of Saturday it is not able to trace the traces of a man passenger.
The airline said she was working with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to track the man down.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Vessels in the region helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after impacting the aeroplane on water as they tried to land at the airport of Chook Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was sailed to the lagoons outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought the plane crossed the landing corridor.
The American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down very low.
- That's great. - Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to move through the water that reached them as the waist to the outlets of the deep-frozen plane.
He said aerosols were panic and shouting and he suffered a slight injury in the head.
The U.S. Marine Navy reported that some seamen working there near to improve a quay were also helped in rescuing using a puffed boat to carry people to the shore before the ship was sinking at about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in conflicts of airline companies registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these conflicts were involved with Air Niugini.
Analyst quotes the schedule of the night when a woman burned alive
The accusing authority completed her speech Saturday in a repetitive trial of a man accused of killing a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett has submitted for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
Explain to the jury how she used cell phone files to put the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Telelis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location records from various cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, noting his previous claims, as the Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' phone the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to speak to Sunford.
Sunford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the accusing authority asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sunford said, Rex was lying because my truck was in Nasville R.
One more contradiction was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile records showed that they knew only one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Telis deleted the messages, calls, and Chambers' contact details from his phone.
- He erased her from his life, said Hale.
The defence is about to start on Sunday.
The judge said he appreciates that later that day the trial will be brought to the jury judge.

A hip hop trio wants to question the negative view of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and addressing social issues.

Artists like Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
Danda in New York sues a couple who fired her after she received a Practical message
A New York nanny treated a couple for racist dismissal after her accidentally sending her a message where her last complained that the nanny was like another black man.
The couple refuses to be racist, contemptuous to Revival treatment,
Linse Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny Jesseel Morris was black, just the last one appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
Mr. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband a message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Morris, and twice did.
Once she realised her galaxy, her embarrassing now Mrs. Plasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done no good work and was waiting in her place for a Filipinoza, according to New York Post.
Mrs Morris received a reward for her one and only day working and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mrs Morris has filed an action against the couple seeking compensation for dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 class a day for the six-month term of work as an internal nanny, for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
- I want to show them that, look, you can not do such things - he told Post on Friday, while he added - I know this is discrimination -
The couple contradicts the claims that they are racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared they couldn't trust her again after they insulted her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist; he told Post Post, husband Joel Plasco.
- But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had insulted, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
Using Revival treatment like this, Plasco said his wife had just born two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
- Would you be chasing someone who's in this situation?
It's not so kind - the bank investor added.
While the legal case is under way, the public court has rushed to condemn the couple in social media, condemning them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not be interested in a bear speaking, as it reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a little after the book was accepted, said about the letter: It's hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before his extradition.
It's a lot fun when you know what we now know about Paddington's huge success...
She said that her father, who worked as a pictor at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book from a stone bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book was Roglupikaris, as her father left the life last year.
Regarding Paddington, which he describes as; a very important family member; added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
He was a quite quiet man and he wasn't superstition, he said.
- But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who manages something: you're proud of it, even if it's not your featuring reality.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by the phone.
After landing, her daughter was transported to the hospital at Louie Paster 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
- Nad was calling me all the time, telling me it was really bad, that she didn't have a lot of hope to do, said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
- Sometime Nad called me to tell me he'd die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive gradually diminished and came out of her body.
He had already died a while ago and that time, and now it's all gone.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm--
Finally, Mrs. Edan-Laperouse, who so far mourns her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, ignoring the test she was passing.
- No one knew it. - He said it.
I had my head down and ran tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I had a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her.
Women who mourn their own lives hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones from suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a Wales bridge with excitement messages and phone numbers that anyone can call to receive support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
- I don't want no parent to feel the way I feel every day - he said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
- Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was burning his room--
However, he left his job before he died, as he was in a very bad state...
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had put an end to his life.
Mrs. Davis said: — I am quite concerned that there will be an impact;
Mrs. Davis has created the Ravi cards to inform the world that there are people out there where you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk -
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, just after the death of his mother.
He didn't say that he felt convinced or upset or something like that -- he said.
A few days before Christmas we observed a change in his behavior.
He had bottomed on Christmas Day - when children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes -
He said his death caused them a huge trauma, but they have to overcome it: He solves the family.
He's crushing us.
But we all have to continue and fight.

The future of Brett Cavanaugh is uncertain as the FBI starts researching
I was thinking that if we could actually achieve something like what it was asking for - a limited and limited research - perhaps we could bring a little section - Mr Fleke said on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee would be dismantled in the middle of entrenched party deadlocks.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance is due entirely to the timeline.
The interim elections are in only five weeks, and if, as expected, the Republicans are not doing well, they will be weakened significantly in their efforts to achieve the election of the person who wants in the country's highest court.
George Walker Bush calls to Senators, begging them to support Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI's report has been presented?
We will vote in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavano can get at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would enable Mike Penns, Vice-President, to take the majority and to confirm his appointment at the Supreme Court.
The number of apostates in North Korea falls under the authority of Kim
The number of apostates from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young Eun came to power seven years ago, according to a lawmaker from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said that 1,127 distillations occurred last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges for migrants were crucial.
Pieying hasn't made any public comments.
In the vast majority of the apostates from North Korea, the citizenship of South Korea is eventually offered.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the severely protected Destroyed Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the apostate illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often deports them by violence.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still at war, have improved considerably over recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pionyang to discuss the negotiations on deforestation, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young Won in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to cooperate in the decontamination of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Reim Jung Il accused American sanctions about the lack of progress ever since.
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we disarm our country unilaterally first - Mr Rim said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozi calls Brett Cavanaugh Rysteric -- she says she's inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
The Democratic President of the Nancy Pelozi House called the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano-Tysteric, and said he was self-confidence unsuitable to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelozi made these comments in an interview Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
-I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted like this, they would call her Rysteric -- - Pelozi commented about the statement of Cavano to the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with intense emotion, refused the charges that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening outburst, Cavano was deeply moved, sometimes almost yelling and his voice shaking as he was talking about his family and his school years.
He also declared unequivocally condemning the Democrats in the committee, describing the accusations against him as the Rotterdam and coordinated political assassination of character, organised by liberals angry with the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections of 2016.
Pelozi said that he believed that Cavanaugh's testimony proved that he cannot serve the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
I think he ruled himself out with these statements and in the way he was accused of Clinton and Democratic -- he said.
Pelozi reacted when asked if she would try to make a complaint against Kavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if the Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives, they will have a confirmation of it.
-I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he serves right now - Pelozi said.
Kavano is a judge at the Columbio Regional Court of Appeal (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh about the Law on Accessible Care Act (Affordable Care Act) or in Roy vs. Wade as it is considered conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions if certain judgments of the Supreme Court were to prevail.
- Isn't it time for a hysterical, prejudicial man to go to court and wait for him to say it's not wonderful?
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of wrath overflow and can't get it out of it without crying.
Dr. Stenem told me 45 years later.
- I don't think it's unusual, do you?
He kept saying - he helped me very much, a woman who was a executive somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique that when he was angry and started crying, he said to the person he was talking about - You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry--
So he just kept going.
And it seemed amazing.
The tears are allowed as an outburst of rage partly because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my most intuitive memories of an old job, in an office where men dominated it, is once I cried out with imaginary wrath and grabbed me from the neck a bigger woman - a cold director I've always been slightly afraid of - and pulled me into a ladder.
- Don't ever let them see you crying, he told me.
- They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they broke you up--
Patricia Schrender, then Democratic senator from Colorado, had cooperated with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught to have an unconscious relationship in a vessel called Monkey Business (Bromourhood) and abandoned the struggle humiliated, Mrs Srender, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of holding the presidency.
- It wasn't such a wise decision - he told me laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven more candidates on the race and the last thing they needed was another candidacy.
Someone described the situation as a Snow Snow White and the seven dwarfs.
Because the campaign had already started for some time, he was back in funding, so he swore he wouldn't get into the election race if he hadn't collected $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
They think I have a discount?
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very strongly charged with emotions - gratitude for people who supported it, disappointing her, with the system that made it so difficult to gather money and target voters instead of representatives and anger with sex - who felt a knot in the neck.
You would think I was having a nervous breakdown -- Mrs. Schreder remembers about the press's reactions against her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my gravestone?

How commercial war between the United States and China can do good in Beijing
Greetings of the trade war between the USA and China were obsolete and while the battle still has to end, a break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump dropped the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The greatest escalation evolved this week, imposing new duties on US$ 200 million items (150 million) in fact with the taxation of half of all products imported into the USA from China.
Beijing returns fires in kind every time, and recently imposed customs duties of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to return the American fires and the second largest economy in the world is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to make Washington retreat, it should stick to their demands, but pilgriming in public in the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jinbong, the president of China.
But according to experts, if Beijing could play its cards properly, American pressures in the war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a rushing political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is in fact far more dangerous than the observers have been admitted in the past; said Abigail Grace, a research partner with a focus on Asia, at the Center for New American Security (Centre for New American Security), a reservoir of thought.
Syria is a ready-for-all for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the destroyed seven-year-old war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walin Al Mualem said that the conditions in the country are improved.
Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore regularity.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their everyday lives and their livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians left the country since 2011 that war broke out.
Others six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Mualem said that aid to rebuild the destroyed country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the Rider 2018 Cup, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 on the Le Golf National Golf Course outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated six times on European soil and has won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the first place again, as the Danish leader Thomas Byorn arrived at 14.5 degrees they needed to defeat the United States.
The US team's Star Phil Mikelston, who fought hard during the longest tournament, threw his shot into water in the par-3 16th hole, granting Francisco Molinari victory.
Italian golf player Molinari shined in all his rounds, so he became 1 of the 4 players who achieved 5-0-0 since the present form of tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was defeated on 5x4 from the lowest on the European team's rating, Danos Thorbjorn Olsen.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson succeeded 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last game in a Rider Cup.
The Spanish veteran of eight Cybers Raider, Sergio Garcia, was crowned the most victorious European of all time in the tournament with a total degree of 25.5.
-I'm not always crying, but today I can't hold on to it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy we got the cup back.
Everything is about the team and I'm glad to have been able to help -- Garcia said moved after the European victory.
He's giving the dogma to John Ram's compatriot, who defeated his American golf club Tiger Woods 2 &1 in an individual game on Sunday.
I feel incredible pride to defeat Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy -- said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record at Cup Rider Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics on one of the greatest players of all time, who have conquered 14 important titles, and only Jack Nicklaus has surpassed him.
The US team had a tough time this weekend finding a target, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
American leader Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, and I'm proud of these kids, and they fought it.
Some moments this morning we've had enough pressure on Europe.
We played hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big chief.
And the 12 players played very well.
We will reconstruct, cooperate with the US PGA and the Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit that.
They were better than us.
