The first economic reforms were carried out by Deng Siaoping's leadership.
Since then the economic dimension of China has been broadened by 90 times.
For the first time last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the USA as the largest market in this industry.
China's GDP may exceed the United States equivalent within two decades.
The tropical storm, Daniel, the fourth storm that was named at the time of the Atlantic hurricanes of 2010, was formed in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm of about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has winds of maximum stability that reach 40 miles an hour (64 km per hour).
Scientists of the National Hygiene Center predict that Daniel will be strengthened by taking the hurricane form by Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from land, it remains difficult to assess the potential consequences of the United States or the Caribbean.

\"One of the jams eventually collapsed and began to leave the void,\" said Frankish Cowal.
The stars emit light and heat as a result of the energy generation during the merger (or fusion) of the hydrogen atoms among themselves to form heavier elements.
Scientists seek through their work the creation of a reactor capable of producing energy in the same way.
However, this is a problem that is difficult to solve and will spend many years until we see the construction of useful fusion reactors.
The steel needle floates over water due to a surface voltage.
The surface trend is reflected as the molecules of water on its surface are attracted strongly, more than they are attracted to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible cortex on the surface of water that allows objects such as the needle to float over water.
The oil of a modern ice globe has two extremes, among which there is a gap that forms a curve inwards. The two extremities allow better support to the ice, even when they are in a slope.
Because the base of the knife has a small curve, when the blade moves to one or the other side, the point that touches the ice also makes a curve.
This makes the ice-cream to turn. If the ice-creams are full to the right, the scatter turns right, while if they fill the left, it turns left.
In order to get back to the previous energy level, it is necessary to exempt from the additional energy pumped from light.
This is possible due to the effluent of a microscopic light particle called “luminum”.
Scientists call this process of \"exhausted radiation\" as individuals are stimulated by the intense light, and cause the emission of a photon of light, and light is a form of radiation.
The next picture depicts people emit photons. In fact, of course, photons are much smaller than in the image.
The illuminations are even smaller than the particles of which the people are composed!
After too many hours of use the filament rope in the lamp is burned, and the filament lamp is no longer working.
The lamp must then change with a new one, it is important to watch out when you change the lamp.
Initially, the lighting switch shall be closed or the cable shall be disconnected.
This is because the electricity flowing at the point where the metal part of the lamp is located can cause you tight electrocut if you touch the inside of the plug or the metal base of the lamp while still at some degree in the plug.
The main part that takes blood on the cardiovascular is the heart muscle.
Blood leaves the heart through ducts called arteries and turns back into it by means of other vein - called conductors. Cheroids are the most tiny tubes.
By his bit, the triceratops broke pilgrimages, traverse branches and rims.
Some scientists believe that the Triceratops were eating cysts, a kind of plant that was common during the Cretan period.
These plants are the appearance of a small palm that has peaks, stiff leaves.
A triceratops could remove the leaves with its strong backbone before eating the torso.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that a dinosaur would eat, although in our day the bracelets and other animals such as parrots (which are descendants of dinosaur) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you were standing on the surface of Ius, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 pounds) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 pounds) in July. Therefore, apparently, your gravity is less attraction.
The Sun has no cortex over which you can stand like Earth. The sun as a whole consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes more and more thin as you move away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part that we face when we look at the Sun is called \"lightball\".
After about three thousand years, in 1610, astronomer Galilee, who came from Italy, used telescope and discovered that Venus has phases as well as the Moon.
The phases are made because the side of Venus (or of our moon) is light, which shows to the mother star. The phases of the first strengthened Copernicus's thinking that planets are turning perimeters of our mother star.

Germany, having ended the battle for France, began to get ready to invade Britain.
Germany gave the attack the name \"Natural Lion\" code. Most of the heavy artillery and commissions of the British army were lost when they left Dunkerk, and therefore the army was weakened enough.
But the Royal Navy was still far more powerful than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could destroy any invasion fleet.
However, few ships of the Royal Navy had their base near possible invasion trails, as the Admirals feared they would sink the air strikes of the Germans.
In the first place, what were Italy's plans, Italy was mainly the \"small brother\" of Germany and Japan.
Her pedestrian and navy were weaker, even though four new ships had just been built before the beginning of the war.
The main aims of Italy were Africa's countries, to understand these countries, had to have a military launch camp so that troops could sail in the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
Thus, they had to get rid of Britain's bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these movements, Italy's shores had to do nothing else.
As far as Japan is concerned, it was a island country, like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel under water and stay there for a long period of time.
At that time they were very slow and had a very limited field of firing.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but as the radar began evolving and having more precision, the submarines were forced to enter under water so that they would not be perceived.
The German submarines were called U-Booats. The Germans well knew how to navigate and operate their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans in battles with submarines, after the war they are not allowed to have much of them at their disposal.
Yes! King Tutankhamon, sometimes called \"Kasilis Tout\" or \"The Boy-Kasilian\", is one of the most famous kings of Ancient Egypt in modern times.
Interestingly, it does not rank among the most important of ancient times, while it was not recorded in most lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 is the one who made him a recognized celebrity. While many of the graves of the past were plundered, this one remained virtually intact.
The largest number of species placed in the grave with Tutankhamas are well maintained, including thousands of artifacts made in hand by precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the irradiated wheels made the tanks of the Assyrian lighter, faster and more prepared to overcome the soldiers and other tanks.

The cavalry is an army fighting on horses, the saddle was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the naked backs of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. The most popular, possibly, nature of this civilisation is Homer, the notorious blind poet, who wrote two literary masterpieces: Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes continue to be popular authors of the theatre and their works are part of the world's most important works of literature.
A famous Greek is also a mathematician named Pythagoras, who we know about his famous theorem about the relations of the sides of rectangles.
There are various estimates of the volume of Hindi-speaking individuals. It is estimated that it is between the second and the fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of natural speakers in the language varies depending on whether the very relative dialects are measured.
It is estimated that speakers are ranging from 340 million to 500 million, while about 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but different writings; in everyday conversations speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
In the 15th century, northern Estonia was in Germany's sphere of cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to bring God near the people of the area, so they designed the Estonian basic dialect.

To learn to create interactive means you need to have conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools that you have perfected in interactive lessons (painting scenario, sound processing and video, narrative of stories, etc.).
Interaction planning requires the reassessment of your assumptions on media production and learning to think non-linearly.
The interactive design requires the components of a project to be connected with each other, but also to make sense as separate entities.
The disadvantage of variable focus lenses is that the complexity of the focus and the amount of elements of the lens needed to achieve a range of focal distances is much higher than for steady focal distance lenses.
This is now a smaller problem by achieving higher standards in the production of lenses than lens manufacturers.
This allowed the focusing lenses to produce images of which quality is comparable to that achieved with fixed focal distance lenses.
Where the zome lenses also lack the fact that their upper diaphragm (speed) is often smaller.
This makes it difficult to use the economic lenses in low lighting conditions without flash.
One of the most frequent problems when converting a film into DVD form is overscanning.
Most televisions have been manufactured in such a way as to satisfy the general public.
For this reason, whatever you see on television had the limits cut to the top, the bottom and the sides.
This ensures that the screen is covered by the image as well as as as as overshooting.
Sadly, when you make a DVD, the frames of the picture can be cut, while if the videos were subtitles close to the bottom, they will not look whole.
The traditional medieval castle from the past inspired fantasy, creating icons of conspiracy, symposium, and Arthurian cavalry.
Even standing between ruins of thousands of years, it can bring to your mind the sound and odor of battle from the depths of time, can make you hear the noise from the armed stones and smell the fear that rises from the depths of the bendrums.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were they built castles from the outset? How did their design become and how did they build them?
A characteristic of the period is that Kirby Muxloe Castle is more a fortified house than a true castle.
His windows with the big windows and his thin walls would not be able to resist a filthy attack for a long time.
In the 1980s, when its construction began by Lord Hastings, in the country prevailed relative calm and defensive demands were only for small gangs of evil.
The balance of power was a system through which European states sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The basic principle was that all European states had to seek to prevent a state from gaining great strength, and therefore national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance.
The Spanish War of the Association marked the first war, where its main cause was the equilibrium of power.
This marked a major change, as the European forces would no longer prejudge religious wars. Therefore, the Trinity War would be the last war to be occupied in religious wars.
The Temple of Artemidus in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. by arson committed by Herodratus.
The Ephesians, angry, announced that the name of Herodratus was never to be recorded.
The historical Strabon, from Greece, later recorded the name, which is known to us today. The temple was destroyed on the same night of the birth of Alexander the Great.
Alexander as a king offered to cover the expenses of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was not accepted. The temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E., after his death.
You make your hand as relaxed as possible while you play all the notes right — you also try not to make too much moves with your fingers.
So you will tire as much as possible to yourself. Remember that you do not need to press the keys very hard to increase the intensity as in the piano.
To obtain extra tension in the accordion's sound, you use the bubble with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communication, identity or the conscious perception of absolute reality, divineity, spiritual truth, or with God.

The culture of the Indian Valley belonged to the Chalkian Age and was located in the north-western peninsula, which contained the largest part of modern Pakistan as well as certain areas of North-West India and North-East Afghanistan.
Culture developed at the mouth of the Indian River from where it took its name.
Although some academics consider that since culture was also in the basins of the most destabilised Sarasvati river, it should be called the right culture in Indus-Sarasvati, while some call it culture Harapa, the first of the places that came out in the light of excavations in the 1920s.
The militarist nature of the Roman Empire helped develop medical achievements.
The head of the August empire began recruiting physicians who created the Rome health service for the first time to take action at the end of the wars.
Physicians had knowledge about various tranquilizers, such as morphine from poppy seed extracts and chocolate from herbs.
Attitude to amputations to save patients from gangrane, as well as the use of haematological epistaxis and arterial arteries to limit blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire has made considerable contributions to the medical industry and has made a large part of the knowledge we have today.
Pieurland origami is the kind of paper-driven type that has the limitation that only one diploma can take place at the time, that more complex diplomacy such as the reverses are not allowed, and that all the qualifications have clear positions.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help infinite diplomats or those with limited kinetics skills.
Children realize quite little the concept of race and racial stereotypes that affect behavior.
For example, children identified with a racial minority subject to stereotypes such as not having good performance at school, tend to have a good performance from the moment they learn about their race-related stereotype.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and has 54 million profiles at the moment.
These websites have received special attention, especially in the educational environment.
There are positive elements on these websites, such as the easy formation of a teaching page, with blogs, videos, photos and other possibilities.
This page can be easily accessed by providing only one web address, making it easy to memorize and typing for students who are difficult to use the keyboard or spelling.
It can be adjusted to easily be reading as well as to contain the desired amount of colour.
The lack of care ‘is a neurological syndrome whose three characteristics include impulse, distraction, hyperactivity or excessive energy’.
It is not an inability to learn, but a learning disorder. \"The 3-5 percent of the students, probably around 2 million American children, has the disorder\".
Children with Lecture Vision Disorder (ADD) are difficult to focus on activities such as school work, but can be concentrated on activities that enjoy such as playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing suggestions without signals.
These children tend to face many problems because they are \"inflicted on risky behaviours, involved in battles and challenge power\" in order to stimulate their brain, as it is unable to stimulate it by normal methods.
The Elimination of Care affects the relationship with peers, as the other children do not understand why they act as they do or why they write as they write or that their level of maturity is different.
As the ability to learn and acquire knowledge changed in a way like the one mentioned above, it also changed the basic proportion of learning.
The approach to obtaining the information was different; there was no longer the pressure on individual revocation, as the revocation of text was more the focus.
In fact, Renaissance significantly changed the approach of learning and knowledge dissemination.
Unlike other capitals, men no longer use hands to move or lift weights or hang in trees.
The hand and foot of chimpanzee are similar in size and length, and mark the usefulness of the hand in carrying weight during the quadrant walk.
The human hand has a shorter length than the leg and a more straight line.
The age fossils dated 2-3 million years before showing this change in the use of the hand by facilitating movement in manipulation.
Some feel that experiencing many artificially conscious dreams often can become very humiliating.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the expansion of the time of sleep with quick eye movements (REMs) causing the clear dreams.
Through less REM every night, the situation in which you experience your real sleep and your body recovers is not happening enough often to cause trouble.
This is the same exhaustive as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The results depend on how often your brain tries to have clear dreams every night.
Since the beginning, things were not going well for the Italians in North Africa. In a week after the declaration of the Italian war on June 10, 1940, the 11th of the British Fortress had taken over the Capuzzo fortress in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardiya, the British captured the archaic of the Italian tenth Army, General Lastucci.

The modern sport of fencing takes place at several levels, from students learning in universities to professional and Olympic games.
The sport is conducted mainly in the form of a fight, as one swordman fights with the other.
Golf is a sport in which players use spades to hit balls so that those enter holes.
During a normal round, 18 holes are played, with players usually start from the first field hole and end up in the tenth eighth.
The player who makes the fewer hits or the moves of the seings at the club to complete the round is winning.
The sport is played in grass, and the grass around the hole is narrower and is called greyn.
The most common type of tourism is probably what most relate to travel: recreation tourism.
It is the case that people go to a place that is very different from their usual everyday life to relax and have a good time.
The places where leisure tourists go are the beaches, thematic parks and the camping areas.
If someone visits a particular place with the aim of getting to know the history and culture of this place, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Guests can go to several attractions of a state or simply choose to go to a single place.
Having seen this activity, the settlers had also called for aid.
The troops that strengthened the front guard included the 1st and 3rd constitutions of New Hampshire with 200 men, under the Colonels John Stark and James Reed (the two later became generals).
Stark's men were placed along the fence at the northern end of the courthouse's position.
When the ampoule created a gap along the Mistian northeastern river of the peninsula, they quickly created an extension to the fence with a short stone wall on the north which ended at the edge of the water of a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake around 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered no shooting until the tactics passed him.
The American plan was based on the coordinated attacks on three different points.
General John Cadvalant would expel a diversion attack against the British guard in Bordertown in order to prevent any backup.
General James Ewing would lead 700 soldiers to cross the river in Trenton Ferry, occupy the bridge over the Assanpins and prevent the escape of any enemy troops.
The main strike team of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two teams, one with Green head and the other led by Sullivan, in order to launch an attack before dawn.
With the change from the race of a quarter of a mile in half a mile, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course a first half-mile runner, a man who can surpass the two minutes, must have plenty of speed, but he must certainly cultivate his endurance.
A little abnormal road running during the winter, combined with the training of the top of the body in a gym, is the best preparation for the period of the track races.
On their own, good nutritional practices are unable to produce high performance, but they can have a positive effect on the overall well-being of young sports.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, exercising effective hydration habits and understanding of the various aspects of supplementing exercises can help athletes to improve their performance and to increase the pleasure of their athlete.
The medium distance paths are a relatively economic sport, however, there are many misunderstandings about the minimum equipment required to participate.
The product market can be carried out on the basis of the needs, but most of them will affect the performance of the minima or even even at the same time.
Sporters may feel preferable for a product even if it does not give them real benefits.
A person can be considered one of the fundamental construction units of all matter.
It is a complex existence that consists of, as the simple model of Bor, a main core around roaming electrons in orbit, and reminds planets in orbit around the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The two molecules that form the core are neutrons and protons.
The protons have a positive electrical load while the neutrons are neutral.
To control the victim, the first thing you'll do is investigate the point to make sure you're safe.
It is necessary to observe the location of the victim as it or approach it and any automatic warning signs.
If you are injured while trying to help, you will only contribute to getting the situation worse.
According to the results of the investigation, depression, fear and destructiveness have increased in the relationship between pain and disability to people who suffer from pain in the middle.
Only the effects of catastrophe, not depression and fear constituted the conditions for regular weekly structured physical conferences.
Participating in regular activity requires more support for negative incidence of pain by distinguishing differentiations of chronic pain and feeling troubled by normal physical movement.
Vision or visual ability are directly interwoven with the visual system or eyes sensors.
There are various eye structures, which are complex according to the requirements of the organization.
Each structure has different possibilities, is sensitive to different wavelengths and has different degrees of acidity, while at the same time requiring different import arrangements and different numbers for optimum operation.
Population is all the organisations of a particular species within a certain geographical area.
They are said to have one form of people in a population where they are almost homogeneous with regard to an individual appearance.
When individuals present a number of variations of a specific feature, it is multi-morphic.
Also, the colonial campaign ants go in line and build their nests in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, the quince ants go through the night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony enters a migration phase when food is reduced, as long as this phase remains, colony creates semi-solid accommodation that changes the next day.
These violence or marches in the south lasted about 17 days.
The word cell owes its origin in the word ‘cella’, namely ‘small room’ and was invented by a microbiologist, who was examining the structure of a cork.
The cell is the main building unit of all living organisms, consisting of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and important for the study of life, which is often referred to as a 'doric unit of life'.
The nervous system maintains the homostasis in the body by sending everywhere nervous pulses that keep the blood flow continuous and undisturbed.
These nervous stimuli can be sent at high speed throughout the body, which helps to protect the body against potential threats.
The wind turbines hit small areas compared to other filthy storms, but they can destroy everything in their readings.
The wind turbines rip off trees, divert boards from buildings and lift cars up in the air. The strongest 2% of the wind turf lasts more than three hours.
These monstrous storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s, 300 mph).
People have been building and using flashlights to grow up for thousands of years.
However, the first truly telescopes were created in Europe towards the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to bring close and maximize long objects.
The greed and selfishness will always come to us, and so it is the nature of cooperation that, when the majority benefits, there will always be more gain in the short term if we act selfishly.

Many dream about the day that man can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some wonder what's out there, while some think there are aliens or other forms of life on another planet.
However, if that happens, it will probably happen after a long time. The stars are so scattered in the space where there are trillions of distance between \"great\" stars.
Perhaps someday, your disciples are in an alien world and wonder about their ancient ancestors!
The animals are made of many cells; they consume their food and make the digestion process inside them. Most animals have the ability to move.
Only animals have brains (though not all, for example, median does not have a brain).
Animals are scattered at every spot of the planet. They break into the ground, swim in the seas and fly in the sky.
The smallest structural and functional unit of a living body is the cell.
The word cell (cell) comes from the Latin word cella, meaning a small space.
If you look at any living being through a microscope, you will see that it consists of small blocks or balls.
Robert Hook, English biologist, observed small blocks in cork with the microscope.
They looked like rooms, for the first time someone was looking at such close dead cells.
Chemicals and chemicals have the ability to change from one form to another and not turn into something else.
The nitrogen gas still has the same abilities as the liquid nitrogen, its form as liquid is more dense, but molecules still are the ones that were.
The chemical compound consists of transtormal hydrogen and monoatomic oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is in gas, liquid or solid form.
Although its physical condition may be altered, its chemical condition remains the same.
Time lies everywhere around us and affects everything we do, and yet it is difficult to understand it.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific experts thousands of years now.
We are experiencing time as a series of events that are going through the future through the present in the past.
Time is also the method of comparing the duration of events.
You yourself can note the passage of time by observing the repetition of a circular event. Cycladic event is happening repeatedly on a regular basis.
The computers nowadays are used to download images and videos.
Computers can create complex animated designs, and this kind of animated design is increasingly used in television and movies.

For a long time during the tenth and twenty-century period, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maoris, who were hunting huge birds called alone.
Then, according to the theory, the idea was developed that the Maoris migrated from Polynesia with the \"Greek Objective\" and occupied New Zealand by the Moraris by establishing a rural society.
According to new evidence, however, the Moraris constituted a group of Maori of the inland that migrated from New Zealand to the Chatam Islands by developing their own special and peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe in the Chatam Islands which was Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Morori, there were some conflicts, and after all the Moraris were eliminated.
The people who have been involved for so many decades helped us to understand our powers and passion by directly assessing the difficulties even the failures.
As we listened to people sharing their personal, family and organizational stories, we collected valuable information about the past and some of the personalities who exercised either positive or negative influence on the organisation's culture.
Although knowledge of history does not mean knowledge of culture, it helps the organization to feel even in the sense of where they are historically.
With the assessment of achievements and understanding of failures, people and all participants are more aware of the ideals, purpose and driving forces of the Agency.
In this particular case, invoking previous business cases and their successes, they helped people to be open to new changes and directions for the local church.
These successful events limited the horror of the modification, bringing at the same time positive slopes towards change in the future.
Different thinking patterns are strategies for addressing issues that unite different thoughts or sectors to achieve response.
This attitude focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as on data recognition, the re-implementation of existing techniques and the gathering of information.
The most important factor in this attitude is the following: there is only one correct answer; the answers you are thinking are only two, that is correct or wrong.
This way of thinking is correlated with certain scientific or formal procedures.
People with this type of thought have reasonable thought, have the ability to memorize patterns, solve problems and process scientific evidence.
Man is by far the most gifted creature in understanding what exists in someone's mind.
This means that we can successfully promote understanding, objectives, beliefs, knowledge and desires of our fellow humans.
Among these abilities, understanding of others' intentions is fundamental, allowing us to clarify possible doubts about physical movements.
For example, if you see someone break a car window, you'll probably assume he was trying to steal a foreign car.
You should judge him differently if he had lost his keys and was his own car what he was trying to leak.
Magnetic tomography (MRI) is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Parsel (by Harvard University).
In this coordination, the magnetic field and the radio waves cause people to broadcast very small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Dammantin, doctor and research scientist, set the foundations for the use of MRI as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later a patent was issued, which was the first world granted to the Magnetic Tomography sector.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian ended the creation of the first magnetic scanner \"all of the body\", and gave him the name \"Indomitable\".
Communication without synchronisation promotes time to reflect and react to someone.
It gives pupils the opportunity to work at their own pace and to check the pace of teaching information.
Furthermore, with flexible hours of work, time restrictions are being reduced. (Bremer, 1998)

Students can also ask questions to teachers at any time in the day and expect relatively quick answers and do not expect until the next meeting.
The post-modern approach to our learning releases from absoluteness, there is only one way to learn.
In fact, there is nothing good to learn. Learning takes place in the experience gained between the learner and the knowledge provided.
Our experience with all television broadcasts based on learning, construction and information provision has clearly shown this topic.
Many of us are getting ourselves to watch a TV show that provides us with information about a process or experience that we are never going to share or apply this knowledge.
There's no way we can make a general service in the car, nor build a crash in our courtyard, we won't make a trip to Peru for research into ancient ruins, nor will we renovate to the neighboring house.

Some thousands of staff live here this summer on about fifty bases that are located mainly in these areas.
The inland of Antarctica consists of a desert altitude covered by 2-3 km ice.
Occasionally, experts plan to fly inland, to climb or to approach the Pole, where a large base is located.
