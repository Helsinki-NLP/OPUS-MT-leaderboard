Welsh Members are concerned that they will be confused by the "muppets"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the House of Wales).
This concern arose in connection with the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Wales Parliament.
Members throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour Party MEP said his prolongation was concerned that "it would end up with the words Twp and Pwp".
For non-Wale readers: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "hawk" and the word "pwp" means " feces".
A Plyde MEP stated that the party as a whole was unsatisfactory and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open-minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w pronounced similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire in letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which currently drafts the draft law establishing the name change, stated: 'The final decision on any name to be called by Members will of course be a matter for the Members themselves'.
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the parliament as a Parliament in Wales.
As regards the title of Members, the Commission supported the name 'Member of the Wales Parliament' or 'WMP', but the choice of MWP is the one that received greater support during the public consultation.
Members obviously propose alternatives, but trying to reach a consensus may be a difficult matter for Parliament's President, Eline Jones, who is expected to submit the bill on changing the name within the next few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the way the parliament operates, including rules of deduction from the Member's post and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the question of their name in the debate on legislation.
Macedonians are coming to the polls on the country's name change referendum
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's vote was called for in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbour hides territorial views and has repeatedly opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, president of Macedonia, fought for the referendum on the name change, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change is simply the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells have been silenced as the churches in Harlem disappear
"The older people I spoke with, they say there was a bar before and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing in a different way today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood 'salon where the world regularly hangs."
As for the churches, it is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the responsible "and sooner or later will return to where they started".
The congregations, he added, may be replaced by houses filled with people who will not be willing to help the areas of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said," he said, and therefore they will speed up the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches prior to becoming Harlem metropolis black - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist Church left in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby took possession of the building.
The occupation of St Martin’s building took over a black church under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who proceeded to boycott the stores on the 125th Street, a basic commercial street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners took over the reconstruction and ordered the carving.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's church, proudly called the knellion "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carigon in July described it a little differently: "cultural treasure" and "replaced instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany Inn from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carg in the world played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carigon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has been happening over the past few months in St. Martin is a complex story among architects and contractors, some of whom have been hired by church leaders, while others from the bishop.
Commissioners - the governing body of the parish, made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter to the bishop in July on their concerns that the bishop 'would have sought to transfer the cost' to the College of Commissioners, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark attack on 13-year-old dive for lobsters in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during diving for lobster fishing in California, on the first day of the lobster age, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach beach in Ensiitas town.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV to San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of the kid who asked for help and approached by rowing with a team to get it out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought they were just screams of excitement because he caught lobster, but then he realized he was shouting "something bit me!
Something bit me!"
The whole clavicle had opened him up," Humel observed when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water, "There's shark in the sea!" He added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Lifeguard Larry Giles stated in the press report that the shark had been located in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim is severely wounded at the top of the torso.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Pondo Bis in Kasabland to Swaamis in Ensinita for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The Sainsbury's projects put pressure on the UK's cosmetics market
The Sainsbury's are mixed with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams placing shelves of cosmetics respectively with those of the stores, staffed with specialists.
In the context of the major rise in the UK cosmetics market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household goods are falling, the largest shelves of cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and will be spread to more stores if the project succeeds.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as the supermarkets look for a way to replace the space on shelves that once occupied TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their offer of cosmetics to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also provide more space with shelves with the logo of the company, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket regains its own Boutique makeup so that most products are vegan - which younger consumers increasingly demand.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to sell its products to two Sainsbury's stores, one that opened in Crointon, South London, last week and the other in Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend of buying small quantities of food daily in local minimarkets means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make people visit.
Mike Coop, CEO of the Sainsbury's, said the outlets would be more and more like the stores, as the supermarket chains try to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more non-food services.
Sainsbury's put outlet shops in hundreds of stores, while they also imported some Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported sales of grocery stores and made them more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a Boots consortium in the early 2000s, but the cooperation came to an end after a dispute about how to allocate profits from pharmacy stores to the chain supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy company with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, compared with £ 125 million three years ago.
It stated that Lloyds would play its own role in the project, adding a wide range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sensation of our seams in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for cosmetics that challenges traditional purchases."
Peter Jones: mad after Holly Willoughby's departure from the 11 million-million-dollar agreement
The protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is outraged after the departure of telegrapher Holly Willoby from the 11 million-million-dollar agreement with the firm Lifestyle, in order to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoby doesn't have time for the Truly apparel and accessories company.
Their business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old presenter of the show "This Morning", announced to Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoby made the starring Dragons Den, Peter Jones, out of profitable business at the last minute, in order to focus on its new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden TV girl admitted during a meeting full of tensions on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that because of his new contracts - £ 1.5 million - he would no longer have enough time to place on the Truly apparel and accessories company.
The company was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and seems to have doubled Willoby's property estimated to amount to £11 million.
After the announcement of 37-year-old Willoughby in Instagram that he's going to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain into some of his country houses.
According to some sources: "Truly was a long way from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was for its long-term future, its source of revenue for the coming decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a storeroom full of products at the headquarters in Marlowe ready to be sold."
Experts estimate that the departure of the "This Morning" show, which is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost millions to the company due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothing, as well as further delay in its presentation.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been keeping close friendly relations with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Wiloby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Couples spend their holiday together, and Jones keeps a 40 - percent share in Baldwin’s television producers.
Willoby is going to become the main person in the M&S campaigns and replace Ad McPartlin in the presentation of the show "I'm A Celebrity" at ITV.
A source of Jones's narrow environment said last night "We wouldn't want to comment on his business affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He was joking about the criticism he received from the media about his comment that some would consider that it is inappropriate to a president and his attitude so positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said, imitating the style of a telepurpose.
"I didn't give anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards the decommissioning of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear decommissioning have been delayed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's leading North Korean diplomat Rai Young-Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "equivalent response" from the United States after North Korea's premature disarmament.
Instead, he stressed, the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump held a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We almost had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim have yielded positive fruit - ending missile tests, release of hostages and returning the rest of the American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual attitude to statements on his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a presidential style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia scan an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their path
In the wake of the Lombock earthquake, for example, it has been announced that foreign non-governmental organisations will not be required.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lobok population was displaced, no national disaster was declared necessary for the development of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international aid, so it is quite difficult," said Mrs Subung.
While the Save the Children organization is preparing a team that will travel to the Old, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national natural disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in the Old to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the seismic vibrations that often hit Indonesia, the country remains relentlessly prepared toward nature's anger.
While shelters have been built for tsunami in Ace, the same is not the case on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of alarm siren for tsunami in the Old, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are even more complicated by administrative care.
A floating hospital that had parked in Lobok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards the Old, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Jocko Winddo had the focus of his election campaign on improving Indonesia's disorganised infrastructure and made simple money available to build roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding is afflicting Mr. Joco's administration before the re-election next year.
Mr Jocko is also under pressure from the persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets, using stabs, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Daniel Strange of Liverpool is a match against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal at the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sterridge accepted all of Sirdan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's finish with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and beat it in the back beam.
His effort was very high from the large area and reached the top right on the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to retreat her and entered the net.
"I was trying to get this position, get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as far as possible forwards, so I tried to earn as much time as possible," Sterridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cande come closer, I made a direct switch, I didn't think much about it, and I did the shot."
Chelsea had the head start with 1-0 in the half-time after the goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Enden Azar.
The blue aggressor gave Mateo Kovacic a heel to this game before giving a shot of head near the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defensive and completed sending the ball to the nets in the back beam with a left shot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight against Naples at the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. Wednesday in Stan Paulo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The tragic estimate of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is 832
The report of deaths following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832, according to statements by the country's natural disaster service, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 degree earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters, said the representative of the service, Sutopo Pouro Noungrocho at a press conference.
The city of Palos, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old suspect after murdering a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was discovered in Birkenhead, Merceiside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Muse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the residents who saw or heard something about it to testify to the police.
Officer Brain Oheagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone around the neighborhood around John Street who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the footage of the dashcam cameras to contact us as they may possess information that is vital to our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and found in a building.
This afternoon friends who believe that they might know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigations are under way as the police said they were in the process of informing the closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse, trying to get back to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants have been informed that they may need to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A policeman is alleged to tell a man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared with tears on the stage.
She's constantly repeating "it's horrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the police ribbon and one outside.
Police were standing outside the ribbon and watching the building.
Anyone who has some information please send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymously with Crimestopers line at 0800 555 111 on case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the quarrel about "writing history"
His extremism would be poetic justice for the Talibanist destruction of numerous cultural and religious works in England by its fanatical puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Creek's proposal as 'immunion' and 'trying to rewrite the story'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "In this debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable not to target the form of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's Palace.
Illustration of England's civil wars was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, a wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the acts of the ancestor of Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamos Thornnicroft is a characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an absolutely precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that conflicts in the mid-17th century have shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognizable personality representing one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also praiseworthy and memorable."
Murderer pig injured deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in South West China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose only name "Woan" was notified, was found with a cut artery in a blood pond near a pigsty in the market in Ljupansue in Guichow Province, in South China, announced Morning Post Sunday.
A pig-stage official is preparing to carry out vaccines in pigs on May 30, 2005, in Zining, Kinhai Province, China.
He was alleged to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found open the door of a neighboring pighouse.
He stated that there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth in the pigs.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crumbled," said the cousin, known as "Wu," according to Guyang's evening news report.
The security camera footage shows Uan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Uan or his cousin.
One market operator said in the evening news report that the pig has been placed in a cage to stop attacking anyone else, while the police collected the evidence at the attack scene.
The Uan family and the market authorities are alleged to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 295 kilos threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal to remove.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was devastated by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "rought".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants are going to bring extensive rainfall to the southwestern US
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest water masses of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rains in North Mexico and South-West America in the next few days.
The wind power of hurricane Rosa reached 85 mph, consisting of Hurricane Class 1, 5 a.m. Eastern time, Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Euhenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure wind region has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa approachs the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical humidity to the north in the southwest.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfalls of 25 cm in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity in combination with the approaching low wind pressure area will create extensive rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rains of 2,5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floods, flood flows and possibly desert landslides.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates that are close to 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour locally, in particular in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains of 5 to 10 cm are expected locally in the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Flooding is likely with rapid worsening of phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended that you avoid any footage in the desert in view of the threat to tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfalls can turn the gorges into cosmic rivers and storms will cause locally intense winds and sandstorms.
The low-pressure area will create some locally strong local rainfall on the South California coastline.
A total rainfall of over 1 centimeters is possible, which can cause small flow of crashes and slippery in the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropical boots will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and the first morning hours on Monday, before the phenomena expand slowly on Monday and Tuesday.
Powerful rainfalls will spread in Fort Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, a number of intense temperature changes will occur across the United States as the Arctic temperatures fall, but in tropical areas remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very intense temperature changes in nearby distances.
A typical example of the intense temperature differences between the central United States was noted on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 points between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moin, in Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistently high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern States, October is expected to start at high temperatures with 27 °C from the east to parts in the southeast.
Temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast of the weather, there are several chances of temperatures above average in the East until the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers attended Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million viewers attended the conspiracy of the US Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavanaugh on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blaise Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with television networks interrupting the normal flow of the last minute's programme: the agreement by Senator Arizona Jeff Fleek to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI in relation to the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that it was 100 percent certain how at a party while they were high school students Cavanaugh attacked her while she was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a charged statement, said it was 100 percent certain that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen’s measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers were attending the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average view on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures did not immediately make available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers attending a transmission from office spaces.
Let's see this TV show in its right dimensions, it's a common similar size to what's been watching a football game of the playoffs or the award ceremony of the Oscar Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Cavanaugh, preceded with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place, ABC is located with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS followed by 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high and after the hearing.
Flake became a protagonist in Friday's drama.
Following the statement by the Republicans moderate to vote in favour of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters disapprove him as he tried to enter the elevator for the hearing by the Senate Justice Committee.
He stood in a low glance for several minutes as they denounced him, live on television at CNN.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say to the Commission's hearing.
All cable and television networks covered live hours later, the vote of the Senate's Committee on Justice on the promotion of Kavana's candidacy in the Senate plenary for vote.
However, Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded following discussions with his friend, Senator of the Democratic Party, Chris Kuns.
Following discussions with Kuns and some other senators then, Flake ruled.
Flake's choice had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not collect the votes for Kavanaugh's approval without an investigation.
President Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa Mai accused the critics of the departure plans from the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Teresa Mai arrives for the Birming Party Congress in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her own in the newspaper headline, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson strongly criticised the Chekers Plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal to collect duties between Britain and the EU was 'extremely absurd'.
Wade Sims shot: The police arrested Suspect Dateon Simpson for killing the player in LSU
Police have arrested a suspect in the murderous shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball team of the LSU.
Diteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned in prison on second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have a video of Simms's involvement with Simpson, and according to police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Cops tracked the glasses at the crime scene and said they spotted traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the CBS-co-operating WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he admitted that he wounded Wade deadly.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by East Baton Rouge coroner released on Friday, cause of death is the bullet wound to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the police in Louisiana a special working party, the police forensics lab, the police forces of the South University and the people of the region to assist in the search for arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joy Alvais thanked the local law enforcement authorities for "strengthening investigation and the pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
Forward, 1,98 yards, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball team coach Weil Wade said the team was "dead" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
"We're always worried about incidents like this," said Owade.
Volcanic ash emissions to Mexico City
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popokatepetel volcano reached the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico's inhabitants on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, since the activity in the crater reached its peak, recording 183 emissions of gases and ash over a period of 24 hours.
The Center watched various indications and small seismic vibrations.
In social media images show car windshield covered with thin ash layers in neighbourhoods of Mexico City such as Sochimilko.
The geophysicists observed an increase in volcano activity at 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 kicks in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following a conflict of protesters in favour of independence with the restoration units of order, as thousands participated in the demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote on the break-up of Catalan that caused polarisation.
A group of masked protesters in favour of independence, which was held up by the restoration units of order, launched eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Complications were also noted later during the day with policemen using their clubs to suppress tactics.
For hours teams of supporters of Catalonia's independence shouted the slogan "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against protesters' groups in favour of the unity of the country calling "Have Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The tensions remain high in the region that supports independence a year after the referendum on 1 October was declared illegal by Madrid, which is, however, celebrated by the separatists Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence, although the turnout was low with those against independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, some 1000 people were injured last year, following the efforts of the police forces to stop voting in the polling centres in the region where violent clashes occurred.
Independence groups were camped on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support from the national police.
The protest took place others were forced to take a different turn.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the demonstrations in support of independence with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia's prospects to gain independence.
"We lived one of our brightest times last year.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they managed to vote for, but now the situation is stagnant," he said.
Although they took note of a victory of vital importance, although limited to regional elections last December, Catalan parties in favour of independence fought to maintain their dynamics this year, with many of their most well-known leaders being self-exhausted or detained pending their trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puts, a 42-year-old engineer, who on his cell phone recorded the protests in favour of the police, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is escalating increasingly," he said.
On Saturday, Oril Zunceras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were confiscated last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Lodonteri: Man Arrest After Car Conflict in Residence · Global Voices
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested following a repeated car crash in Londontree residence.
The incident was unfolded in Bolinagard Cressend on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blammings said damage was caused at the gates and in the building itself.
There may have been a shot in the car sometime.
Menga's hit gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone assured victory.
The projected Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Stephen Jerard his second defeat in 18 games as the manager of the Improx Group.
Dolly Menga's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Himpernian in second place.
Gerard's team stays without a win out of the championship this season and faces the Harts, who have an eight-point lead next Sunday.
Before this race, Rangers host Rapid Vienna at Europa League on Thursday.
Liveringston in the meantime continues her race in six games in her category, with the main coach Holt still having no defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities to visitors
Holt's team should've taken the lead long before he scores, with her prosperity embarrassing the Rangers.
Scott Robinson took the lead and almost reached the finish, but Alan Lithgow disobeyed his attempt to slip Craig Halckett's head off from the finish.
The hostes willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they were able to push visitors to free strikes and corners.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Rangers couldn't stop a hit, and Livingston opened the door, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who took it all and scored it from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the occupation of the ball, but they found the defense of the fieldmen impenetrable and the Terminal Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos removed the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was disgusted by the feet of the Rangers' closing guard Alan McGregor, and the Lithgo's pass came out to another free hit on Livingston.
There have been many vertical passes in the Liveston area and they have been continuously disproved, and two sentences have been demanded - after Haulket's claim against Glen Midleton's replacement player and one for hand - which they were rejected.
"Exquisite game" from Livingstone - analysis
Aladder Lamont from the Scottish BBC on Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
spectacular performance and results for Livingstone.
All of them were excellent, beyond expectations in this upward course.
The game style and personality changed little after they returned to top form, but the credits should also be given to Holt for the impetus he gave to the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halckett was excellent, recruiting an extremely organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrell on alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the contrary, had no inspiration.
No matter how good they were in the past under Jerard's guidance, they didn't respond to these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once managed to cross the defense of the hosts and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed feelings at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the Heads of State of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to restore relations with NATO's allies.
They had come to a break in relation to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
Police have ruled out the concentration of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have been able to approach to see their president closely.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish-German heroes and others as a dictator.
Car accident in Detfort: death biker after car collision
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street crossroads, a busy road in Detfort, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a biker, who lost his life on Tsilders Street, at a distance of about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are trying to identify the man and to inform their closest relatives.
The roads have been shut down and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six Officers were injured in clashes
Six policemen were injured in riots that broke out in high security men's prisons, according to statements from the prison department.
The riots broke out in His Majesty Long Lartin prisons in Warstershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still under way.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been recruited to cope with the riots, involving eight prisoners and manifested in one ward.
The police were hospitalized by minor injuries to the face during the contraction.
A prison representative said: "Specially trained personnel have undertaken to deal with the incident in His Majesty's prisons.
Six staff members were treated with wounds.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may carry out a greater penalty."
In His Majesty Long Lartin's prisons more than 500 prisoners are detained, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the prison manager was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October of last year, the class rehabilitation units were called to prison to suppress serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with balls of billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the areas with drought may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but that is precisely what is likely to happen in the beginning of next week, as the remains of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwestern parts of the desert, bringing floods to their pass.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued extraordinary warning sheets for flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right above Phoenix on Tuesday, where he will arrive late Monday by rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service pointed out on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometric situation less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the U.S. National Hurricane Center provide for rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in Mongolon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the Southwest, including the Central Brake Mountains and Grat Basin, rains of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with a chance of individual total rain volumes of up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk from flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing as the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the South-Western States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest type of drought," the weatherer.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the land on the Baha California Peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the hurricane, on Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with maximum winds 85 miles an hour, moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the land in Mexico with tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Extreme rainfall may occur in areas of Mexico, which will pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall volumes of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baha California to the northwestern Sonora, which are likely to reach up to 10 inches," according to Weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected by Hurricane Rosa or his residues is the very heavy rainfall in Baha California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern States of the USA," said the US National Tunnel Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and torrents of mud in deserts and landslides in mountainous soils.
Attack at Middleer Norton: Four arrests for attempted homicide
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old manslaughter were arrested as suspects of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old manslaughter who brought knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Mindsomer Norton Excelsior area, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was moved to the hospital, where he remains in a stable state.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old was arrested during the night in Randstock district, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are calling for anyone who may have recorded on their cell phone what happened.
Trump states that Cavanaugh has experienced the deformity and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outraged tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Willing West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "very experienced the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of being a candidate.
Cavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday, categorically denying Christine Blaise Ford's allegations that he sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also submitted to the hearing a statement of objections.
The President said Saturday that the American people saw the greatness, quality and courage of Cavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent public service course," he said to the multitude of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while he was talking about the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually it's like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first significant procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Kavana is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, CNN senior member of the Republican Party leadership told the CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is projected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were lured by the giant waves that swept off the coast, when big earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people had assembled for a festival on the beach of Palos on Friday, when waves of six meters hit the land, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
"When the threat to tsunami occurred yesterday, the world was still on the beach and did not run at once, when it was hit by it," said Sutopo Purgo Nugrocho, a representative of Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency, in an update to Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come on its own, dragged cars, wood, houses, hit everything on the land," Nougrocho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palos.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management service show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Metastases continued to affect the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) said in a communication that the energy released from the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have raised the size of tsunami, he said.
Nugrocho described damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels collapsed.
He said that bodies of victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugrocho said that the victims and damage might be larger along the coastline of 300 km north of Palos, in an area called Dongala, which is closest to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication systems "removed completely and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get worse," he said.
Great criticism was made at the Service on Saturday because he did not inform that tsunami had hit the Old, although the waves according to officials had reached the time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, it sounds like a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic trying to warn people down on the road to the tsunami coming.
Within minutes, a water wall impacts the coast, dragging houses and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great deal of power cut, which stopped communications in the wider region of the Palos, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army started sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but displaced people still need desperate food and other key types of emergency.
The city airport was only opened again to contribute to aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Jocko Windondo's visit to the evacuation centers in the Old Sunday.
The victims of tsunami in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to reach the city of Palos, where the workers found shelter in mussamad accommodation set up in their courtyard, they passed devastated scenes along their path, Mr. Doceba said.
"I was told they saw a lot of damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have taken on the sad task of starting the process of relief for the affected, some denounce that foreigners, particularly experienced workers in the field of aid to travel to the Old.
Under Indonesia's regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be started if the place of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can apply for international assistance, but there's still no decision."
As the second day passed in the Old after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less grim.
On Saturday, a little boy was recovered from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman trapped under debris for two days next to her mother’s dead body.
Genton Subadono, coach of Indonesia's national parachute team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, who were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Maddagji, were his students.
"As old as the sport of the parachute slope, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Genton told us how when news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was released to the community of paratroopers, he started sending desperate messages of whatsApp to his opponents in the Old who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the indication next to his messages was a gray symbol "n", instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves extracted $26,750 during the refuelling of an automatic take-off machine in Newport and Levi.
On Friday morning, thieves extracted $26,750 from a Brink employee refueling an ATM machine in Newport on Levi, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver had evacuated an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the announcement.
While he was busy, another man " came running behind Brink's clerk" and stole a bag of money destined for surrender.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the spot, according to the announcement, but the police did not determine the number of persons involved in the event.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport Police, calling 859-292-3680.
Kane West: Rapper's changing his name to Ye
Rapper Kane West is changing his name to a son.
Announcing a change in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The who is officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been listening for some time to the petty son and used this nickname as a title in his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grante, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Besides being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word is of religious significance to him.
"I think the word "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," West said earlier this year, in a conversation about the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kane, which means "the only" to a son, who is just a reflection of the good, the evil, our confused self, everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who've changed their name.
Shin Cobbs is known to be names like Puff Dandi, P. Deedy, or Deedy, but this year he has announced that he prefers the names of Lab and Brather Lab.
A former West partner, JEY-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's elected President swears he won't use the army against civilians
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military violence against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody student suppression.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in the Plaza Square that he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when the left student movements gained roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the area of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes into addition to communications from various parts of the US Government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not have a comprehensive official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented last year its plan to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence issues by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all the other countries are so far behind in the United States and we are seeking to make the next important discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (the superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) was released this month from the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Managing Director of Sinovision Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American Otello player, and later he was executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's annex to China.
Lee recognised the importance of previous US Government technology competitions, such as the Challenge of Robotics of the Advanced Defence Research Plans Service (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would be held to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not China that gets the best of academic space, it's the companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university authorities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be offered automatically to doctoral diploma holders in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the Artificial Intelligence Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Institute of Physics provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government organisations respectively share money with American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, to which partners from business and academic world will be joined, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Institute of Sciences in the United States today invests more than 100 million dollars a year in the field of artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made for months in US law to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian citizens are holding a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The Macedonian people participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed to "North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece that had blocked the country's candidacy to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether participation will reach 50 percent to make the referendum valid.
The question on the list was: 'You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece'.
The proponents of a name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that Macedonian youth can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because all our lives will be safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of the vote in order to become final.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for a name change.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, participation only reached 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when it gave the present 66 per cent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and Dusko's son voted in the referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union membership of the country in Stromika, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring long-distance investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaf said after voting.
He said a positive result would be 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, the referendum will take place from 30 to 43 per cent of voters, which is less than the required participation.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telema TV station, 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote positively.
For the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy, since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes Brighton's entire defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling completed Brighton's defense by winning a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etichad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed scores easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian aggressive received it in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He went through three Brighton defenses before he went through the open space.
Aguero was later found surrounded by four green players.
He shook me through one defensive, then escaped from several others at the edge of Brighton's big area.
Then he gave it to his left, finding Sterling.
Anglo Forward made his first move in the area returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg to defeat the Brighton Matthew Ryan's finalist, scoring the right side of the nets.
"Aguero is facing some problems on his feet," the reporter of City, Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored goals at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the blues the original advantage in the battle of Premier Ling.
That goal came to the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into the Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and led Sterling to the rear beam.
The Blue Ford kicked the ball in the net just before he got out.
City faces Hoffenheim at the Champions League teams on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. on the Rin-Nekar Arena Stadium in Sinsem, Germany.
Serzer wants to beat the Rockies.
As the Americans were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try and make another start.
But the always competitive Serzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies in the playoffs, as they are preceded by a game of Los Angeles Dogers at the National Ling West.
The Rockies have gone to the playoffs with their 5-2 victory over the Nazis on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first place in their charge.
"Although we have nothing to win, at least we can play in the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and the other team will probably be a game of the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight such a game?"
The Nazis haven't yet announced who's gonna be the original shooter on Sunday, but they're allegedly tending to let Serzer throw the ball.
Serzer, who's going to start his 34th, did coaching shots on Thursday and play on Sunday, which is normally a rest day for him.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his selected candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavanaugh in his speech on the importance of the Republican participation in the interim elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
This is a very important moment, and I am not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am, and, for this reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: "You see this disgusting, disgusting radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to exterminate to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give them them."
Democrats, he said, have undertaken a 'resistance and obstruction' mission.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angered and bad, wretched and liared."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary by name to Senator Diane Finestein, a petition that was accepted with strong disapproval by the public.
"Remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
That was a really ugly use of the body language, the worst use of the body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
It is not tolerant of those expressing their opinion
I was not surprised that Momentum activists in my local group voted to exercise my reproach.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Party Members to whom they have said that they are not welcome, precisely because we are of our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, has had a similar attitude because he has strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticised because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, strangely, for similar issues to those for which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The call for the Nottingam East Workers' Meeting on Friday said "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation".
Most of the eight years that I am a local Labour MEP, the meetings of the General Commission on Friday night were just like this.
Unfortunately, today, it is not this tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'more merciful, more compassionate' policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever really been implemented.
It is obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This started a little after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I thought we had similar political views began to wait for me to turn 180 degrees and adopt opinions with which I would never agree, whether they were national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke in public, regardless of what I was really saying, I listened to a social media scissors, where people asked for my rejection, renounced the centre's policy and said that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues, as the comments that have been made to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face a torrent of sexist or racist offenses every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how insults are now considered normality.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every motion of censure or a change in the rules of choice, the party's limits are too narrow.
I've been advised a lot in the last two years not to stand up, not to talk a lot and that everything will be okay.
But I didn't get into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a disciple, due to the neglect shown by the Thacher Government, which has literally led to the failure of my entire class, my intention was to defend better public services for those who need them the most, whether as a member of the local council or as a government minister.
I never hid my policy and did the same in the last elections.
No one in Nottingam East could have been confused in any way with my political views and my points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who promoted the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is facing a Brexit that will hit households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, indeed, my only message is not to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political feasibility will prevent me from acting as I believe it is in the best interests of all of you.

Ir - Melrouse: 38 - 17: Invincible Ire climbs to the top
Two retarded goals may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ire deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining game of the Tenned Championship today.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only invincible group of ten.
Eventually, it was her upper defense, as well as the best use of opportunities, which raised the balance for the benefit of the lawmakers, and coach Peter Murci had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrouse said: "Congratulations to Ire have taken advantage of opportunities better than we do."
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, with the conversion of Frasier Climo, brought Ire forward, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage, and Jason Bagot noted a goal without conversion.
Climo increased Ire's lead with a penalty before he scores, right in the half, a goal with conversion, leading Ire to the locker room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started her second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Bagot's conversion, reduced the lead to five degrees.
There was a long waiting due to a serious injury by Ruride Nott, who was removed by a stretcher, and, after the restart, Ire increased the difference with a Starfleet McDonal goal, with Climo's conversion.
Deputy Chief Blair McFherson then took a yellow card and Melrose reused the arithmetic advantage with Bruce Colvin's goal without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The hosts came back, however, and, when Struan Hutchinson took a yellow card on the climax without the ball, from the pendant line, McPherson scored a goal at the back of the attack Ire's unleashed.
Clima made a conversion, as he did almost again since the reset, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's kick and sent out Extrem Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the hosts.
Stil Game protagonist starts a new career in focusing
The protagonist of the Stille Game Ford Kirnan series seems ready to move to the focus sector, after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of an licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the popular BBC show, which he's been co-chairing with his partner in Greg Hebfield for years.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle would be the last of the show, and it seems Kirnan is planning his life after Gayegland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although a source of Scottish Sun implied that Kiern wants to deal with the "mainstream industry of the focus" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": The enclosed Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Seamen are patrolling at the Navy Headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they are flying blue flags.
At the bases of the navy from Lake Titicaka to the Amazon, the motto is written: "Our sea is rightfully registered.
It's our duty to take her back."
Throughout the enclosed Bolivia, the memory of Chile's coastline after a bloody conflict in the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have been further developed today than ever, for decades now, as Bolivia has been awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the dynamics, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course awaits the result positively," said Roberto Kalzantila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be following the ruling of the International Court on large screens throughout the country, hoping that The Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim for Chile to be forced, after decades of unstable talks, to negotiate to grant Bolivia a dominant exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia, who gives a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has a lot to win or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that even if they did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued only six months after the presentation of the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated," Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law, said.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's goals, the last four years may have undermined them.
"Bolivia's current government has usurped the question of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood in Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velje, a Bolivia spokesperson in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court ruling was unusually rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will acquire "an excellent opportunity to inaugurate a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "endow an end to differences of 139 years with mutual benefits," he said.
Kalzantila also refused that Morales, who is still one of Latin American most popular leaders, is using the matter of going out to the sea as a political junction.
"Bolivia will never deny her right to access the Pacific Ocean," she added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament if you cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the leaders of the two states.
Ri made these comments while US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeau, seems ready to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy that had come to an end, three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Young Eun.
Ri states that the view that the ongoing sanctions and the US refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point force the North to "fly" is a summer night dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pyongyang does not first make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and the American president, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is broad skepticism about whether Pyonyang is seriously thinking of dismissing an arsenal that the country considers most likely to be the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyonyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trab Summit.
Paris Fashion Shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available at a shop near you
If you want to raise the hat collection you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring-Kellory 2019 collection that stole the performance at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Excellently uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and the designers sent their impressive creations to the passarella.
The part that distinguished from Valentine was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide wing with wings completely covering the head of models.
Among other super sizes accessories were displayed watermelons decorated with stones, a wizard hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to high sewing fashion.
One creation brought to mind complete breathing equipment and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a crucible.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach the main shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats quickly made their appearance after La Boba, the straw hat with the very wide one we've seen wear so many, from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The popular farm that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent another great creation to the pasarela, a sandy beach bag almost as big as the model that carries it in his swimsuit.
The dark orange shelves bag, decorated with shelves and a white leather handle, was the part that distinguished from the collection La Riviera Spring-Kay 2019 of Jacquemus at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous stylist, Luke Armitaz, stated in FEMAIL column: "I expect to see large hats and large beach bags at the stores next summer, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a prehistoric history in academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with a further series of excellent results in the exams, which were only further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent School Council (SCIS), are struggling to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher educational levels, the professional career they will choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum on demand, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable lesson of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you're talking to someone in a language that understands, then what you're talking about comes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder of the fact that we cannot just rely on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's examinations, we find that the languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in the independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved a degree in A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a degree in Mandarin A, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French and 63 percent of students in Spanish also had A degrees.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as a selection course, are considered as important as courses relating to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
Research by the UK Committee on Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that as far as the reasons why employers had difficulty in covering job vacancies were concerned, 17 per cent concerned a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require linguistic knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you will choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill that you can use throughout your life.
If anyone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language to speak a double-digit percentage of respondents (15 per cent).
That is why investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially of the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find jobs with meaning.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK in 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose in the independent schools, which have qualified teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools in Scotland provide with dedication a learning environment that children prepare and equip them with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future holds them.
One cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturality and excellence for Scottish young people.
They have to.

Lebron's gonna do his debut to the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of fans who are looking forward to seeing Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has come almost to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first game before the season against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been decided yet how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James asked about his plans about the six toy program that the Lakers have to give before the racing season.
"I don't need a game of preparation at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's gathering in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of gatherings, starting in West Virginia Willing.
This is the first of five scheduled concentrations of Trump next week, including tours in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his choice for the Supreme Court on standby, Trump seeks to strengthen popular support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch her online?
The gathering of Trump in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's concentration in West Virginia online below through a live YouTube stream.
Trump is likely to refer to this week's hearings about the candidate for the post at the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanaugh, who were held in a tense atmosphere because of the allegations of sexual misconduct, with a vote to confirm the Senate that has been put on hold for up to a week while the FBI's investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help Republicans facing a dubious outcome to the November elections in order to gain some potential.
Thus, the staff of President Trump's campaign said that these five gatherings next week are intended to "mobilise volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so critical of its agenda, that the president travels to as many states as possible, as we travel to the busy period of the campaign," he told Reuters a representative of Trump's campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The scheduled for tonight's gathering at the Wesbanco Arena of Willing could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state that won by far over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republicans candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low in polling.
"It is no good sign for Morris that the president should come and try to give him a push towards the polls," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the courage to fight while keeping hopes alive as it marches on Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday's fours this afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating momentum is a completely invented sporting idea, but players believe it deeply, especially in such controversies.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were six degrees ahead, and now they're in front of four, so I guess we have a little momentum," Jordan Spith said when he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of leading four points and staying twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air in their sails" and have a lot to encourage them, such as the twin Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and everyone got three degrees out of four.
Spith was deadly from tee to green and he sets an example.
The voices of the celebrations became stronger as he continued his round, reaching a critical blow to get the game all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The blow by which they won the game on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations showing his conviction that the American team is not out.
"You need to look deep inside and worry about your own game," Spith said.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more grades than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin in Europe has achieved four in four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but she also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which the energy seems to flow towards and from the noisy viewers, seals the fact that they are the players that will have to win on Sunday and there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time to different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Webson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, morning's Fourball's hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two double on the front nine, they had the Spaniard and the Swede so deep in a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there won't be anyone helping you out of your hole.
Fourball and Foursome are so exciting struggles to watch them closely due to the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played a better role as a team so far and has taken a significant lead in the last day, but this race Foursome has also shown that the U.S. team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its head start in the Fourball and Foursome Saturday with 10-6 against the USA.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari inspired two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far in four degrees.
The European side of Thomas Birne, who is trying to maintain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unfortunate American side in morning fourball with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted more in the Foursome, winning two matches, but they couldn't cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points from the 12 single races on Sunday, to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points, and with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a shocking weekend, is just the second twin to win four points in the first four races in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reid at the Fourball, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and the American newcomer Bryson DeSabo with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged to the two Saturday matches, showed occasional brilliance explosions, but has now lost 19 of his 29 races in Fourball and Foursome and seven rows.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning Fourball, returned to Henry Stenson's partner for the Foursome 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka, conquering the first and third place on the world ranking.
Not everything went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spring and Justin Thomas set the bat for the Americans two degrees on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory over John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the Fourballs and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory Mailroy 4&3 in the Foursome while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup could a team recover while losing four degrees in singles, though because he is the Tropical, Furik only has to achieve a tie to maintain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is out of their reach.
North Korea says it's not going to disarm unilaterally without confidence measures
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepen the sense of distrust towards the US and that his country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho said at the annual general meeting of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "major goodwill measures" in the past year, e.g. the interruption of nuclear and ballistic tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to start our disarmament unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage" approach to de-nuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it progresses progressively in the process, his statement was important that it did not completely exclude unilateral de-nuclearisation, as Pyonyang did in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Young Eun and Donald Trump's joint communiqué at the first summit held between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the "nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyonyang must first deliver its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The US insists on "first decommissioning" and increasing pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their purpose by blackmailing, even blocking "the end of the war," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can kneel us is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jain in the last five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of decommissioning was South Korea and not the USA, the decommissioning of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. inland with North Korean ballistic missiles was inevitable because the "Caccus President" Trump called Kim "missileman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who was threatening to "destruct" North Korea all over last year, has set Kim's voyage for his courage to go through with disarmament measures, but has said there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is demolished.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyonyang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pombeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and continuously until full, final and confirmed decommissioning is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to eliminate the funding of Pyonyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyonyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyonyang in July saying that there had been progress in denounced by North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea has committed to a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States has taken "respective measures".
He made it clear that Kim told him that the "respective measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and promoted normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students attend courses on how to get some rest
This year, a new lesson at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep longer in an attempt to combat the growing mass of culture in the whole night study by eating a lot of caffeine.
An academic found that students at 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, for example how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, Professor of Hypnosis, Harvard Medical School, and specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the lesson, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after a speech about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I just learning about this in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The first lesson this year explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving general prosperity.
Paul Barrera, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, stated that the university decided to include the lesson when it was found that students lacked sleep within the week to a significant extent.
The mature course includes a series of interactive work.
In a section there is the image of a student dorm where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of routine sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the student's behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chisler.
The culture of being proud because you studied all night, he said, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The enough sleep, good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as deprivation puts the brain in starvation, resulting in a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chisler draw the lesson, having attended one of his ranks last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar program before starting their studies in this highly competitive educational establishment.
Professor Chisler recommended that students set up an alert for the time they have to go to bed, as well as an alarm clock for wake-up time, and know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can decouple the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers One-0: Menga scores Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad defeat outside the building, as Dolly Menga's shot led Steven Jerard's disconnected side to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Improx's team sought to score its first win outside of the February triumph with 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as coach, leaving the team eight points behind Harts, which is the first in the Ladbrokes championship ranking.
Menga hit seven minutes before his half-time and his inspiring Rangers roster seemed incapable of returning.
While Rangers is now in sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third, with just one goal different from Himpernian that precedes.
And Rangers can expect more trouble, as Superintendent Calum Spence had to get first aid for head injury caused by an object that was thrown out of the platform.
Jerard made eight changes in the team composition and scared Eir into the semifinals for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Livi 11" that took a degree from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well-built machine was able to drown every attempt of the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the occupation, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when the first distant penguin of Menga sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's district, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep Keegan Jacobs free shot found Chief Craig Halckett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have won a penalty in 15 minutes, as he colluded with Steven Loules, but referee Steven Thompson ignored Colombian complaints.
Rangers only had two shots in the area in the first half, but Improx's former terminator, Liam Kelly, did not worry at all about Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovi Ejali's subtonic shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race Livi was well below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved victory for effort alone.
Rangers still failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball off to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and found the Menga who just completed the effort.
Jerard made half-time changes, taking out Kuliballi and putting Ryan Kent on the line, and the change turned out almost immediately, as the extremist took the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with Lithgos and Halcketts, to remove one distant ball after the other.
Holt's side could've increased the difference to the end, but McGregor treated Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt at the corn.
Rangers' deputy, Glen Midlton, had another pencil phase toward the end, as he colluded with Jacobs, but Thompson ignored it again.
Almanac: The Inventor of Guiger Counter
A page from the Almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BALE ... the day that in Germany the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hance" Guiger was born.
Guiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to the device that is now known as a gigger counter.
Style of Science since then, Gaiger has been in the sphere of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a gigger counter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of people caused by radioactivity in metal components."
Evans: "Look, she's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention of his name continues its work.
New anticancer vaccine teach the immune system to see the problem cells
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune system to see the problem cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells in the treatment
The method includes the export of immunocells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and then reinject them
One vaccine under trial has hopeful results in patients with different cancer types.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the troubled cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of immunocells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory to "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then the reinjection of the cells.
Professor J. Berzovski, from the US National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzovski explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach to which immunocells are exported from patients and then "teached" how to target cancerous cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.

Kanye West was disapproved in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after another interview in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was going to run for election in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again (to make America great again), he gave a recital against the Democratic Republican and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white guy and he says, "How do you like Trump?
If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL opened up with a sketch that Matt Damon played, with Hollywood's star trying to disguise Bret Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blazy Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's delirium video went up on social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to enlist West with this post.
Also, West protested to the public that they didn't treat him well in the background because of his hat.
"They've smashed me in the backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
They've been bowling for me!
And they say I don't know what's going on," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
I'm gonna wear the Superman cape, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were disapproved at least twice by the public and the SNL coefficients seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety said, with one person saying in the magazine: "All of the studio prevailed dead silence."
West was called as a replacement for the last minute of singer Ariana Grant, whose ex-boyfriend Rapper McMillier had died a few days earlier.
West got a lot mixed up when I Love It was sang dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West supported Candace Turner, head of TPUSA Conservative Team, who tweeted: "Towards one of the most courageous spirits:
However, the show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "hisself and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") who I believe is embodied and essaying ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the being that was previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and he's following in Dedie's footsteps, also known as Puff Dundy, Puffy and P. Deedy.
Rapper Snoop Dong had changed his name to Snoop Lyon and of course the music legend Before had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.

Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, criticizes toxic masturity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of swordmaker John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, the Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31, criticizes the stereotype of a bunch of heroes, saying that such roles on the screen pass on to young boys the message that they should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something goes wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masturbation can be combated in #MeToo era.
KlTT, who recently married his congressman at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to having a strong view of the subject.
"Personally now, I believe it very much, where did we make the mistake of masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up in relation to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the masculine characters it promotes.
Continue: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they should behave like this to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people."
The interview also admitted that it does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "the end of the battles and the horses".
Since November, Kit will be starring at the revival of Sam Shepard's True West project, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with his wife Rose is the best he gained from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in a row, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose played Hygrite, John Snow's erotic repellent, the character that Kit plays in the Emmy-winning Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China Report Increase 14% on New Events · Global Voices
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, signalling a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly to some parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infected people in this way was almost zeroed, as officials of the China Health Sector had said at a conference in Yunan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decribed in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual contact with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are caused by insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines in its efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters disguises that a member leaked Republican senator's data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, US spokesman Maxine Waters disproved claims that a member of her staff published three Republican senators' personal information on the Wikipedia pages of the legislature.
Democrat member of Los Angeles argued that the claims were promoted by commentators and websites of "the right-hand side".
"Lies, lies and even more terrible lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information is reported to include the residence addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsay Graham, South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and seems to have been published by an unknown person from the environment of Capitol Hill during the Senate Committee's hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill said.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and blatant lies," continued Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false claims, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and blatant lies."
Waters' statement quickly criticised the Internet, including the former White House secretary Ari Flaiser.
"This denial is full of anger, writes Flaiser.
"This shows that he does not have the courage to be a member of Congress.
When someone's being accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be cowardly.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and quiet."
Flaiser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democracies' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of being very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republicans candidate seeking to depose Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," tweet.
In her statement, Waters reported that her office had notified "the competent authorities and enforcement authorities of these false claims".
"We will do everything to find those responsible," he continued, "and accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff."
Review of the movie Johnny English reruns - a subtonic spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film with a British character and this seems to apply to this revival of action-community film with a hero Johnny Inglis, which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and returned in 2011 with the movie Johnny English: Return.
Can this humorous self-sacrificing lighthouse about how obviously a mess we are to make the nation's new export chance?
In any case, incompetent Johnny Inglis with his wretched eyes was able to renew his license to screw up for a second time. His name states that it is a wider comedy creation designed for non-English-speaking film viewers.
It is of course the unspeakable secret agent who, while pretending to have the glow and ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouse, with a dose of "master bin" and something from the guy who played a single note on the film's musical theme The Roads of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the traveller and international mystery man once played by Atkinson in Barclaycard's most forgotten TV ads, sowing the chaos in his path.
There are one or two nice moments in this JE's last movie.
I liked it when Johnny Inglis approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propellers beat his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, humor is quite hypotonic and curiously paradox, especially when "serious" film franchises like 007 and Dangerous Mission now contain enough comical elements.
Humor seems to be directed to children and not to adults, and, in my opinion, the crazy retreats of Johnny Inglis are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's style sketches for Bin's Persian.
The eternal central issue is that the Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cynicker has penetrated Britain's super secret web spy network, pulling the identity of all British agents on a mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in a service that Kevin Eldon plays in a sadly small role in his range.
It is the last drop for a splendid and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse due to political anti-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing the best she can with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario is not very helpful to her.
Information consultants inform her that as every active spy has been revealed, it should bring back someone decommissioned.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who now works as a director at some aristocratic school, but he gives informal courses for secret agents: here there are some nice scenes, as Inglis offers a press espionage academy A School of Very Rock.
Inglis returns to Whitehawk for urgent information and reunits with Buff's former and passionate partner, which Ben Miller is playing again.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role to which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin of the Gafa for His Secret Service of Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful and fatal Beneficial Beneficial Beneficial Benefits of Bulletova that Olga Kirilenko plays.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously fascinated by the gifted billionaire technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's technological problems: the threatening Jason Volta, which Jake Lacey is playing.
Inglis and Buff start their odyssey: disguise as waitressers, set fire to a high-french restaurant, cause chaos as they try to board illegally on Volta's luxurious yacht, and Inglis causes anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as adorable and troublesome as it is, it keeps reminiscent of children's television.
Moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role where he will really grow with his talent?
Workers disprove that they are considering a plan to work British four days, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan for British people to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days of work.
The party reportedly seeks companies' bosses to channel the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers, giving them an extra free day.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources say that the idea goes hand in hand with the economic agenda and the party's plans to turn the scales in favour of the workers.
The four-day change was approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way of benefiting workers from the changing economy.
Top source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a policy change before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one night, but the four-day working week is a ambition aligned with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow government secretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "personal managers" and "profit-holders" to the utilities.
The shadow government secretary's plans also mean that today's shareholders in water companies may not get their entire share back, as a potential Labour Government could 'restraint' due to suspected irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans for the placement of workers on the boards of companies and the creation of mutual funds in order to provide 10% of private sector companies with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could affect some Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday, Scott Peley, a correspondent on the 60 Minutes show, asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could unravel anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy showed up more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, absolutely," Kennedy said.
"I said that by going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him straight: "Did you do it?"
He was unmoved, determined, unequivocal."
However, the vote of Graham seems to be not going to change.
"I've decided on Brett Cavanaugh and he'll need some explosive charges to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett strongly refused it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
"And whoever has named, can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything changing."
What is Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also a equally impressive mission: the eradication of world poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are expected to flow to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Son Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting against it.
To ensure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as volunteers declare, send an email to a world leader, call or find other substantial ways to help raise awareness about their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a reward with a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "clicking" when people feel that they really make a difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" than its supporters, promoting a number of different targets.
He says these actions helped the world's leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to over 37 billion dollars, which are going to affect lives of over 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team reported 390 commitments and communications as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the insured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and developers, who have undertaken "to help children make full use of their capabilities", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate malnutrition, having received more than 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project called The Power of Nutrition, which is aimed at 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate the extreme poverty?" included in the site's frequent questions,
a member of the Global Citizen community answered: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the major human rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are united more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who are going to show up at this year's New York organized by Deborah Lee Farnes and Hue Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to "exclusion" by blocking Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can turn "if necessary" on its Navy to prevent Russian energy being placed on the markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where he is attempting at the invitation from the legitimate government, is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I think the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States, with the support of the Navy, can ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees in the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group characterised as the "people's voice" in the USA.
He compared Washington's dealings with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, little or no less, the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "the pony that knows only one trick", as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as Trump's administration has undertaken to strengthen US gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from Moscow's "inappropriate" project on Nord Stream 2.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing pipeline capacity in 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong resistance to the project is economically motivated and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude caused Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Diter Kebf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider a nomination for the Presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would seriously consider a candidate for the presidency following the mid-term elections.
At a meeting in the town hall of Holliouk, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our problematic government, and that's why a woman at the top is needed," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine the possibility of a candidate for the Presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying that she "driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump does in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't chew her words about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course and an FBI investigation is needed before the vote".
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think they should run for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% was in favour of such a bid.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% being in favour of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other popular names from the Democrats that were discussed in relation to a possible run for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he'd have officially decided by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Pailin reported on Trak Pailin's Post-traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's gathering.
Trak Pailin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
Arrested and accused of domestic violence Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the consequences of the Post-traumatic Streat Disorder and the injuries that our soldiers carry when they return home," he told the public in the context of a concentration on Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pailin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode," and said of her son and other veterans that "return a little different, they return harder, they return wondering if there is respect for what soldiers, airmen and any other member of the army have done for the country."
Arrested on Monday in Washington, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, intervention in a report on domestic violence and armed occupation while in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Guasila Police Department.
18 states and the region of Columbia supports the question of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region supports a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted a report on amicus curiae on Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to question politics, NBC News said.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Ceción, who was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" abused her, however, US officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
He was held in Texas.
The lawyers of state supporters of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are coming, as countries that face serious gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Committee on Immigration (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Prosecutor General of the Columbia Region, Karl Rasin, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a barrier violates this principle," according to the amicus curiae report.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that refuses entry into immigrants harms the US economy, suggesting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "require the workforce".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges of immigration cases no longer to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape domestic violence and gangs.
"Aceda is available for those who leave their country of origin due to persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political view," Sesion said in his communication of 11 June on politics.
The aim of asylum was never to relieve all the problems (even the most serious) faced by people daily in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in the Old, as the number of dead doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse all the time.
"It's very intense," said the 35 year old mother, Rosa Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby who had a fever, to an evacuation centre that had been set up in the destroyed city of Palos.
"Every minute the ambulances bring more bodies.
The fresh water is scarce."
Some residents attempted to return to their ruined homes and collect their possessions through the water, trying to salvage what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were damaged by the 7.5-dimensional earthquake on the Richter scale were unable to meet the needs.
Some injured, such as Dui Harris, who suffered a fracture of the waist and shoulder, remained outside the Old Army Hospital, where the first aid was given to the countryside due to the continued strong intersections.
tears flooded his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake to shake the room in the fifth floor of the hotel sharing with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife shouting for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspaper published a four - page ad in a daily US newspaper in favor of mutual commercial benefits between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to disperse his propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's post in Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to get involved in the Congress elections on November 6th, a charge that China refuses.
Trump's accusation that Beijing attempted to get involved in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is not forbidden for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war and have imposed mutually various import duties.
China's trade war tariff retaliations were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa, supporting the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts reported.
Terry Brandt, US Ambassador to China and former commander with a long term mandate in Iowa, a state that is an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit the workers, farmers and businesses of America.
China, as Branstad wrote in an opinion article in Sunday Des Moines Register, "is serving on this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"In an attempt to disperse this propaganda, the government of China exploits the valuable tradition of freedom of speech and of the free press of America, publishing on payment advertising to Des Moines Register," said Brandt.
"On the contrary, in the pockets of Beijing, you will find few divergent voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on the problematic economic path of China, given that the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided offering to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
Republicans alienate female voters in view of the mid-term elections due to the cavannasian fiasco, analysts
As many leading Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, to the next mid-term elections.
Feelings on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be restored," said in The Hill, Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Fleek's last-minute move (R-Arizona) to seek an investigation from the FBI will be enough to attract angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will certainly not forget it in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson of the MoveOn progressive group, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "November coming!" in the Senate Corridor as the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission gave the green light for the candidacy of Kavana, despite Dr Christine Blaise Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," said Stu Rodenberg, an unbroken political analyst, on the news website.
"He says it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old who, while dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement in detail described her complaints of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court, the analysts had predicted that there can be a reaction if the Republicans proceed with the anointing.
"It is a huge chaos for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former chairman of the National Republican Commission, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about voting in committee or about the final vote or about whether Kavanaugh will be removed; it is about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they were brought to it," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA Group helping to elect the Democrats, pointed out to news channels.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the statements made by Fortn and Kavanaugh, slightly more in favour of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of the respondents certainly or probably believed Ford's statement, while 35% said that he certainly or probably believed Kavana.
In addition, 38% said that he believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his statement, while just 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Last week Ford swore to the Senate Court that Kavanaugh attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals while they were at a party when they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Web Inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Burners Lee, the global web inventor, starts a startup in order to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new spirit of this technology is Inrupt, a company based on the Berners Open Platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where to store their data, as well as who can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage space" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, outstanding lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the electronic data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this possibility "personal enhancement through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Burners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project and a community of volunteer code developers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said he and his team don't talk to " Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overthrowing business models overnight.

Bernard Van: A tribute to a clergyman who received the Viktoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church who has received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honoured in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, on the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had seconded the highest British military discrimination.
Saturday was the revealing of a commemorative plaque by his two grandsons, accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "exquisitely symbolic" that the plaque unveilings took place just 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act of the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Van led his order to the Saint-Kenten Canal in the middle of a very dense fog and while he was under heavy fire from combat guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "exquisite manhood" led the line forward before hitting himself with a battle gun three of the excerpt.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never reach is something that makes you feel unlimited."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wreath after the parade, led by the philharmonic youth Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great honor that took part in the parade" and added that "the masculine of a genuine hero is proven by the support he has from many people".
MMA fans stayed up late to watch the Bellator 206, but saw Peppa the Purunaki
Think of this scenario: you have stayed up to watch the fascinating Bellator 206, but they deprive you of the joy to see this unique sporting event.
The San Jose program included 13 matches, including six on main card, and would be live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mussashi and Rory McDonald were about to go out in the ring, the viewers in the United Kingdom were rewriting when the show changed in Peppa the Wurunaki.
Some were not happy at all as they had stayed up until the first morning hours especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described the projection of the children's program as "some sort of sick joke".
"According to legislation, this content was not appropriate for 6 o'clock in the morning, so the children's program had to be projected," said Dave Svarts, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the Purunaki, indeed."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they were going to work out the program to include UK spectators in the future.
"If we think about the relays, I think we can do it," Koker said.
"But it's six in the morning of Sunday there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our own time, or their own Monday.
But we're trying to.
Believe me, when the change took place, many messages were exchanged backwards and not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you next time, that won't happen.
We'll limit it to the five races instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to offer more to the fans and we overdo it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olympiacos in diving, Tom Daley, said that he grew up feeling inferior to the rest of the others because of his sexuality, however, this forced him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until high school that they're not all like me.
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern in Radio 4, she said she supported the rights of homosexuals to give the others "promise".
He also said that since he became a parent, he has been less interested in a victory in the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Yang, a regular presenter of the well-known radio broadcast, has been on leave for several months because of a disease.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He stated: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me the power and will to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they were finally learning about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympian is an occasional defender of the rights of the LGBTK community and took advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to move forward in decriminating homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he was lucky to be able to live openly, without repercussions, and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that "it was a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Award-winning Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, but claimed that the age difference was never a matter.
"When you spend so much at such an early age" (he participated in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a peer who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said that he "changed his whole perspective."
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted to do was win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years of cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you won't be around us to sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was now dead I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley played at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life, fighting in the diving at the Olympic Games in my homeland, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which inspired him in his preparation for the Olympic Games and even gives him a shudder.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts at BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's out of form will sit on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mikelson will mark a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time (number of records) in the matches organised every two years, was forced by chief Jim Furick to sit on the Fourball and Saturday Foursome.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it is used to in the United States, the five-time winner shared the day to inspire from the lines and "work" his game hoping to correct his problems.
Without ever having been the most direct drive even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the narrow court of Le Golf National, where the distant ones are often problematic.
And as if it were not enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, is facing Francesco Molinari, champion of British Open, who is working with the newly emerging Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mickeyson's game can be critical.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he plays today, hit me friendlyly on his back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's got a lot of confidence.
His name is at Hall of Fame and he has offered too much to these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't think of him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we should go.
He wants to get out there like everybody else."
Mickeylson's gonna get over Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday matches at the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup that didn't reach its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half, although Furick said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make plates and he's excellent in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players were also having fun tempting him this week, and it was funny to see it.
His contribution is not only to the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Biorne, knows that the great lead can be lost soon
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great lead that starts from the last day's singles on Ryder Cup can easily be converted into defeat.
Danus made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a team led by Sheve Balesteros managed to gain a five-point advantage over the Americans, but just managed to cross the final line with a breast difference, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You're constantly reminding yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," Biorn said, in the picture, after watching the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday and led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that this isn't over.
We're going all set tomorrow to give it all up.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the grades on the board.
We have a target to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that there are equally good players in the other team – the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Biorn adds: "I wouldn't rush to prejudicialize the result.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow counts atomic performance, and that's something different.
It's great to be on the field with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then you try your most of your skills as a golf player.
This is the message you need to pass on to players, how to get their best tomorrow.
You leave behind your teammate and he must give it all up and show himself the best."
Contrary to Biorn, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to perform better atomics than they had with their teammates, except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three grades of the four.
Furick himself has experienced both extremes of the overthrows of the last day, as he belonged to the victorious Brookline team before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every single word of it," he replied when he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader in 1999, had rallyed his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get this momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the middle fights.
We decide our turn accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has undertaken to lead the race and faces Rory McMilroy at the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it covers the whole route," Birne said justifying his singles choices.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The new freshness of the German Navy should have been put on service in 2014 to replace the oldest warships of the Cold War, but will not be received until at least next year, due to defective systems and increased costs, reports local media.
The position in the Rheinland-Pfalz fryer, the flagship of the brand new wells class Baden-Wuertemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which invokes a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with tradition have been decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen wells.
They will bring a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some Stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that maintenance work is reduced, as new wells can be used for up to two years outside the German ports.
However, the constant delays mean that although warships are considered to be the latest technology, which will enable Germany to show its strength abroad until they are finally put to service, they will already be outdated, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fryer became headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to pick up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned to a shipyard after delivery.
There has been no known information about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a series of important 'defects with software and material' that would disuse the warship if used on a battle mission.
The software problems were particularly important. As Baden-Wuertemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 seafarers, only half compared to the oldest Bremen class wells.
It was also revealed that the ship has far greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of Rheinland-Pfalz fryer is believed to have twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from defective equipment, costs for the whole project (including crew training) were also a matter.
It is said to have reached a glossary of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), while the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of new wells are particularly important since Germany's naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Barrells, head of the German Parliament's defensive commission, admitted that the Navy "will not have any ships for missions".
The official stated that the problem was exacerbated over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but there are no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg wells could join the Navy.
National Trust hears the secret bats' life
A new survey conducted on a farm in Highlands, Scotland seeks to reveal how bats use the scenery when chasing their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the planning of future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanomide and the micro bat, as well as Dobenton's cafeteria and the Dobenton mytle in the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations around the farm to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using hand detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings by experts will verify the frequency of the bat calls, and what kinds have this behaviour.
Then, a map of the habitat and a report will be created in order to create a detailed picture of their landscape-scale behaviour.
Rob Duar, a natural environment advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important for bats and how they are used by any species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve the bat forests and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by building and development projects affecting the parties where they are squeezing and destroying their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as well as flies adhesives and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They're using an advanced soundproofing technique to detect insects and obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, inspect the bats’ heeling places and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created the first and only refuge in Scotland for bats only in the Threave estate, in Dampris and Galloway, where eight of the ten kinds of Scottish bats live.
The land manager, David Thompson, says the property is the perfect land for bats.
"Here in Threeve we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many large trees and an ideal habitat.
There is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to increase their populations."
Points out that it is important to first check the existence of bats before any maintenance work in houses, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and small ones, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them or disturb their peace, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said: "There is still a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species we simply do not know about the evolution of their populations."
Ronalto refuses the complaints of rape, as his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine.
Christiano Ronalto described the allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to insult themselves" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The aggressive national Portuguese and Yuventus aggressor is accused of raped an American, named Katherine Mayorga, in the room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
According to the complaint, she's allegedly paid $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to 142 million followers, Ronalto, 33, described "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is make news," the five-time winner of the Golden Ball on the camera said.
"They want to provoke themselves and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and it's all right," the player added smiling.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they made, which they described as "unacceptable reports of rumors touching private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skerts said the player would demand compensation for "ethical harm in proportion to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting them at a nightclub, Ronalto and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her rather than naturally according to documents lodged at Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronalto fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that it was "99 percent" a "good guy", but betrayed the other "one percent".
The documents say that Ronalto admits they had sexual intercourse, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her wounds were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she was "afraid of retaliation" and concerned about her "public humiliation".
34-year-old says he's trying to overthrow the settlement, as he continues to suffer from a post-traumatic syndrome because of the alleged incident.
Ronalto was on the verge of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Union at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to Italy Yuventus to ensure an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will regret the loss of cars" · Global Voices
The United Kingdom "will regret forever", if he loses his reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain abandons the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car industry stated that the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where the models Auris and Avenues of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota Managing Director in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of exiting the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has declared that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to risks in the supply chain according to the automotive industry in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line follows the just-in-time. The spare parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured on request.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be border problems, resulting in delays and a shortage of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock beyond the day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Teresa Mae's plan for the future relationship with the EU 'is specifically attempting to resolve the issue of cross-border controls'.
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio Today 4.
"The elements that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that the continuity of the supply chains must necessarily be ensured."
Toyota was unable to say how much carpeting would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the trade union manager of Unite at the factory, said that the members of the club are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
Government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, the White House announces
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed another week", as the controversy over the candidate at the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanaugh, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Interrogator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility of Trump dismissing the Deputy Prosecutor General, endangering Mueller's independence, fuels Washington's gossip months ago.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire in order to record his talks with Trump and to allow the President to be removed under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House on reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "drop" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Justice Committee on which both Cavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford testified.
On Friday, Trump instructed the FBI to carry out an inquiry into the allegations against Kavana, thereby delaying the holding of a vote by the Senate plenary.
Sarah Sanders, a Trump spokesperson, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: 'No date has yet to be set, maybe this week, but perhaps another week will be postponed, given all the other cases in the highest court.
But we'll see, after all, I like to keep the guy up to date."
Some journalists objected to this claim: Sanders has had press briefings to the White House since September 10th.
Appearer Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the updates was not due to dissatisfaction with the moves of television journalists, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown".
Then let it be understood that there will be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The President is giving more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without quotes: "We have looked at these numbers."
Updates will continue, Sanders said, but 'if the press can ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to apply this often and you have seen that we have been applying this often in recent weeks and will take the position of press briefing where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled journalists.
Minister for Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System in the middle of fears for Brexit
The Minister for Health sent a letter to the EU citizens employed by the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and wish them to remain after the UK has left the European Union.
Jin Freeman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter while less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for permanent resident status (settled status) for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Friman wrote in her letter: "During the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued and go for anticipated decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of not reaching an agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of any employee who is independent of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrobi undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Christopher Abercrobi underwent an emergency surgery following a head injury in the Saturday race, where Tennessee State Tigers were defeated with a score of 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the newspaper journalist Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reid's main coach told reporters that the injury took place shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the bench and just collapsed there," Reid said.
Teachers and medical staff gave Abercrobi oxygen to the bench and then put him in a truck and transferred him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV TV station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrobi was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no "even data on the type/extension of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, a second-year student under limited participation ("redshirt"), is spending his first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made five of the clicks on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching the total of 18 tackins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher card fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher paper fee to buy real estate in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tories plans.
The measure will counteract the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the paper fee will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £ 120 million per year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will start imposing a higher card fee on the UK property market, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, as Teresa May announced today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more economic housing and to target high-wages.
The increase in the paper fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of housing.
The increase, imposed on the current paper fee, along with the highest rates of taxation introduced two years ago for a second home purchase and renting may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will bring up to £ 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and more difficult to enter real estate buyers.
Many wealthy regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "city-claps" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is only introduced a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the paper fee so that more young people could obtain their first residence.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of real estate high, but gaining land without using it and calling on Mrs. May to abolish the plaques in economic housing in order to restore Britain's 'damaging disgrace'.
Mr Corbin has announced a series of impressively proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on evictions of 'due fault'.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "I said last year that I would dedicate my Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And this means repairing the broken property market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and foreign-based companies to buy homes as easily as hard as hard workers British nationals.
For too many people the dream of house ownership has become very distant and the inconvenience of the lack of homelessness remains exist."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train the Scottish team"
Sanderland's chief, Jack Ross, states that his "absolute ambition" is at some point to be a coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of resurrecting the North-Eastern UK team, which is currently in the third place in the Third Class Football Category of England (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after bringing St. Miren back to the Scottish Championships the previous season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team, and that's what Ross told the Scottish BBC on the Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Hubden all the time with my dad as a child, and that's something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will come only if I have success in training teams."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sanderland is Dick Advocatt, David Moyas, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette and Paolo Di Canoe.
Former coach of Aloa Athletic says he didn't feel awe when he was invited to succeed in such established names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
"Now the success for me will be measured based on the answer to the question "Can I bring this team back to Premier Ling?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this group, it is undoubtedly part of Premier Ling's group," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach in Dabarton and a period of 15 months in Harts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Aloa return from subjugation to the third class and led St. Miren from the lip of subjugation to the conquest of the Championship next season.
Also, Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartpell, Fallerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said, remembering the taking up of Aloa's coach.
"I really thought it suited me more to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making decent money out of it, and I was getting quite high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with stress and stress at work, but my coach's work fits perfectly.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I'm doing it, I'm more comfortable than I've ever felt with myself in my entire adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30pm on Saturdays, according to research.
The summer heater strengthened the profits for the tested pubs of Britain, but it brought more pressure to restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 percent, as the numbers revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultancy firm, who collected the data, said: "The continuous sunshine and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as last month, in June, where the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants suffered even greater blow.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenue in June simply deteriorated in July.
The liquor pubs and bars have gone a long way, with the corresponding figures in previous years rising more than the restaurant data fell.
Food pubs also suffered during sunny days, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, the sales of beverage increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM company's recreation and hospitality analysts, said: "These results verify the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sport events remain the largest sales factors in the offshore market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to find difficult, but the drop in sales by 4.8 per cent annually will be particularly painful given the continued cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have occurred at a worse time for businessmen in the focus area, and time will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-considered extension."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade names.
The Coffee Peach Tracker sales index for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses profitability data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of more than UKL 9 million and is the established industry reference point.
One in five children keep secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents
As the survey reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years old - keeps secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents and teachers
Research of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake pages ("fake Insta") in Instagram
This news intensified the fears that sexual content was posted
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "principal" account to show their parents
One out of five children - even just 11 years old - create social media accounts, which they secretly keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake "fake Insta" accounts - is a reference to the Instagram photo notification website.
This news intensified fears that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a healthy "principal" account to show their parents, while at the same time they keep private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, identified a teenager who urged others to rape her ("rape me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awarness UK and the HMC in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted having kept secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are subject to the temptation to create websites where their parents and teachers cannot identify them".
Eileed Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Steam Council.
Eileed Doyle was elected as a non-executive consultant to the Scottish Steering Council at the annual general meeting of the management body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious athlete, and President Ian Bitty commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her broad experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eylind enjoys infinite respect for the entire Scottish, British and world track community, and we are sure that the Scots in Scotland will benefit enormously from its entry into the council," Bitty said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can actually contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, has won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischaemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether or not I would recover.
It was debilitating, but I got fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing motiveal exercises!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!"
Advertisement of a female female who compares mothers with cows divided online public opinion
A suckler cow producer has divided online public opinion with an ad that compares mothers who are breast-feeding with milk cows.
In order to take the so-called "globally first quiet and worn masturbation", the Elvie consumer technology company released a humorous publicity inspired by video clips to show the freedom it offers to nursing mothers the new so-called masturbation.
Four real mothers dance in a cow bar full of hay, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see any tails" and "If you didn't notice it, these are not breasts, it's my tits."
The choir continues: "Take it, draw it, feed babies, draw it, take it, milk it, milk my ladies."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 screenings and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the spectators, as many people say it does not take the milk industry seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, we need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth," someone commented.
Elvie's breast-feeder fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: "Seenly traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "An advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended advertising, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "speaking".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a so-called so-called so-called so-called nursery.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
Ad is a little crazy, but I didn't sit around and overanalyze it.
It's a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone commented: "It's a funny advertising aimed at mothers who draw breast milk (frequently in their workplace or in their toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not advertising that praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all danced with the discreet maids in their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who draw breast milk with a navel say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Fellowship is completely silent, has neither cables nor pipes and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, keep their babies and even go out during pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and Executive Creator in Mother, commented: "The Elvie Fellowship is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative slant.
By making a parallel between suckling women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on pumping mother’s milk and all the challenges it involves, while at the same time showing a fun and correlated way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new womb will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie browse becomes a headline page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the passarella for fashion designer Marta Jakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has reached their peaks, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the administration of Trump have made it more difficult to match children with conservers.
Traditionally, most conservers are themselves immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to go out and ask for a child and thus jeopardise their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was intensified in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential conservers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who were asked to support unaccompanied minors.
Later the service confirmed that 70 percent of the people arrested had a white penal record.
"About 80 percent of those who are either resident or members of the conserving household are illegally located in the country and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr Albens.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, operators have introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously applied, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, in the place of self-personal appearance, in order to develop their claims for legal status before the judge responsible for immigration.
Those who are judged not to meet the conditions for exemption will be expelled immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to get nervous or upset, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have been released from the system in recent months.
Counsel has said that these concerns are intensified in larger installations such as Turnio, where indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely not to be understood, due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving sufficient time to prepare children psychologically or say goodbye to their friends may aggravate the trauma they are already fighting with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "principal forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said in the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions of others have been rooted out of their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "give this sacred battle until we've thrown all Syrian terrorists away" from both terrorist groups and "each illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and informing both Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on its territory destroyed by the war of the country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions are good for their return and accused "certain Western countries" of "dispersing absurd fears" that led the refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politician an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarised zone in the last great revolutionary bulwark in Indlib created an opportunity to promote political debate.
The Russian Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "definite deadlines" and hoped that military actions would target jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaeda front Nousra, who will "neutralize".
UN special envoy Stafhan de Mistoura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to 'in the revision of the articles of the current constitution' and warned that there should be no intervention.
Because Trump's gonna win a second term.
With this logic, Mr Trump will regain the 2020 elections, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, the motion of censure and scandals are going to end his presidency prematurely.
Something that would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of all times!"
So far there's no sign of spectators tiredness.
Since 2014, TV viewing numbers in the high viewing zone have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News television has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-screening area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned the TV numbers on satellite television, with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
It is a fire to which people are attracted because it is something that we do not understand," Neil Bauer, a producer of ABC's dramatic series "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president following an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Skovel, veteran comic series script writer and author of the book "Just the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi journey in Boston before the elections in 2016.
Her driver said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked why?
"Respond "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Skovel said to me.
One can have fun even with chaos.
Of course, unlike the television series, the scenarios that come out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy case against Wade if the immigrant families can reunite the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of an up-to-date citizen when you're here for six hours watching a group of experts talk about the use of "very long interviews in the background" by Bob Woodward about his book "Fear" ("Fear"), the bomber jacket of Paulafort with a value of $15,000 ("a cloth full of hybrids", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the glazing descriptions that Stormi Daniels made on Mr Trump's anatomy.
Well, I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"What he does and gives you the sense of reality is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the TV program "Pawn Stars", about the ever-changing actors and daily overthrows in the plot of Trump's play (painfighting with N.F.L., praises Kim Young Eun).
You don't have the luxury of losing any episodes, or you stay back.
When I met with Mr. Fleis this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Kawai, but he was locked in by seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be dismantled, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to attend the Senate Court Committee and the High Court's future was hanging by a thread.
"I remember making these crazy shows back in the day, and people said, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

External money comes into the most marginal race for the mid-term elections
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania electoral district in Congress receives a flow of money thanks to the re-election of the congressional districts, which set two active members of Congress for the same position.
This recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburban region is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another region in special elections held last spring.
Lamb has as an opponent another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the former Pennsylvania constituency, which largely coincides with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old regions were being manipulated unconstitutionally for the benefit of the Republicans.
The election campaign in the new 17th constituency triggered a campaign of financial competition between the largest financial parts of the parties, the Committee on Democratic Campaign for Congress (DCCC) and the Committee on National Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamp became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a marginal victory in a special election campaign held in March, for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress, which he attended many people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political analysts give a slight lead to democrats.
The United States has examined the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but they have backed up.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the administrative team of the Trump Agency.
State Department officials decided to call on the American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions no longer to recognise Taivan", as Heather Nawert, the agency's spokesman, said earlier this month.
However, the imposition of sanctions was considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to receive about USD 140 million as US aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial support and targeted restrictions on passport visas, would be painful for the Central American country, with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings were evolving, the North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent the transition of refugees to the United States.
But, in mid-September, senior management made it clear that they wanted to move the conference forward, effectively putting an end to the thoughts of penalising El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Penns is about to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance of the concentration for the administration, as the diplomats have said.
All three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The spokesman for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the blockade of justice by Mr Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is rumoured that Mr. Mueller also turns his investigation into the possibility of co-responsibility between Mr. Trump's election campaign and Russia with regard to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr Trump will be held accountable before this body, as he is preparing to reclaim the presidency in the next election and perhaps before a sworn court.
'if' is a lot and I do not imply that the fall of Mr Trump, nor of his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices that we all have to make from both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of slaughter.
The term of history revolves around such points of turning and the inviolable course of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing enough of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr Trump fired Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he was in that newspaper that last year he proposed that the president be recorded secretly and considered him inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr Rosenstein said that the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
"How will we answer whether the recently requested F.B.I. investigation into Bret Cavanaugh is not complete or fair or is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the well-founded charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections on a Congress that will put Mr Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I took in the Things, I think we won't fail.
My mother was Czechoslovakian Jewish who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Jew’s candles on that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior executive in Brookings Institute, is the president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizen Movement for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) and the author of the book "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Centre in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorns of Rangers is an optimist for the battle with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with Viyareal earlier this month, will give her many chances of being qualified by the 7th Europa League Group.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorns from making his first appearance in the season until the scoreout with two or two with Viyareal, but he thinks that Rangers can use this result as a lead for bigger hits.
"It was a good time for us because Viyareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We got into the game thinking we could achieve something and we went to some degree.
Perhaps we could get away at the end, but, in general, the drawdown was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
All right, well, we can take three points, but it's gonna be a difficult game because they brought a good result to their last game, but, with the world on the platform, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and the changes made to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, training is good.
Hopefully we can do our best now, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of retirement savings
Although research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken about this issue to their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have this conversation," Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business, said.
Start with it.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your long-term financial options can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a buy-in price to help you cover these costs or self-security with your own property - provided you have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care proxy in order to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes in case you are not able to contact.
Also, consider doing a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make economic decisions on your part and to ensure that your accounts are paid in case you become helpless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are facing an emergency health problem and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Please provide these details in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin wondered.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan."
Man received multiple ammunition with a gun on Ilfracomb
A man took multiple fire with a gun as he walked towards his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove district of Ilfracomb in Devon County when he was shot at the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Summer Time as a "accident".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds he suffered are not threatening for his life and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have not been able to obtain information from Dongala, an area in the north of Palos, which is closest to the centre of the 7.5-point earthquake on the Richter scale.
In the Old more than 16,000 people were removed after the outbreak of the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palos and Dongala on the island of Sulawazi:
Palos is the capital of the province of central Sulawazi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawazi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a requisition that extends over 300 kilometres (180 km) of coastline to the southwestern part of the island of Sulawazi.
Regentism, an administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main supports of the economy in the province of Sulawazi and especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is found most in Morouli, across the coast of Sulawazi.
Paul and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Destruction Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit Western Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the earthquake ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the greatest recent earthquakes and tsunami are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on December 26, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, while over half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead on the island of Nia, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-point earthquake on the Richter scale hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-point earthquake on the Richter scale, centred near the city of Pantang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the islands of Medawi, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost life to about 300 people.
2016: A low focal depth earthquake hit the Pindi Jaya area in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as it brought memories of the destruction that the murderous earthquake and the tsunami of 2004 sprinkled in the world.
It wasn't tsunami this time, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Pailin's first-born son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Pailin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Pailin was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Pailin, from Guashila, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, blocking a complaint about domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to a report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a known woman attempted to call the police to report the crimes she allegedly committed, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Pailin is temporarily detained at the Mat-Su temporary detainee, with a guarantee of $500, as reported at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "surely, innocent" when asked, as the network says.
Pailin faces charges of three category A crimes, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to one year and a $250,000 financial penalty.
He is also accused of a category A attack, punished by one day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time a criminal prosecution has been prosecuted against Pailin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, blocking a complaint about the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon, while intoxicated.
His partner claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Pailin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawezi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 - grade earthquake on the Richter scale caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been shut down, while the number of dead is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the central Sulawezi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media circulate videos from the time of the catastrophic event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a celebration on the beach in Palos town when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the seldom death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty to be imposed on Saifulo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York, which has cost eight people a seldom punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to attack a bicycle road along the West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors should prove that Saipov killed the eight victims with intent and caused serious physical damages "with intent", according to the statement of intent to impose the death penalty submitted to the Court of South York.
Both of these charges bring the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov against the indictment of 22 indictment points, which included eight charges of homicide in pro-criminal organization, a tactic that is often applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a charge of violence and destruction of automotive vehicles.
The attack required "important design and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov attacked as "abominable, cruel and negligent."
"Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused pain, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Angelini, Nicholas Clives, An-Loor Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferruci, Ernan Diego Mendosa and Alejandro Damian Panuko," as stated in the declaration of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South York District Court had prosecuted a case that draws the death penalty.
The accused, Halid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 for husbands Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of a conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan national, seemed unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the interrogators he felt satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack by ISIS video he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to set up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to the police.
He pleaded innocent of the 22 charges recorded in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public lawyers representing Saipov, said he was "presumably disappointed" by the public prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty instead of accepting the declaration of guilt for life imprisonment with no chance of release will simply prolong the trauma that caused the events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand that a death penalty be imposed.
Member of the Tories says that YESJEL FARATZ should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians had to 'press the pressure' by Eurosceptics, as one of Teresa Mei Members said he should be the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bonn told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already have "been out" until now if Mr Farage was the Minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs Mai is facing in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MEPs was underlined by the fact that supporters of EU Toris' stay participated in a separate protest gathering against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain the draft Chekers compromise in the middle of attacks by Brexit defenders, defenders of EU and EU residence.
The allies have insisted on moving forward with their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and to force Eurosceptics and Workers to choose between her package and Chaos.
Mr. Bonn said at the Leaves Means Leave (Departure means leaving) in Solihal that he wanted to fly "the Checkers project".
He said that he should have been given a kindness title to Mr Farage and given authority to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we'd already be gone now," he said.
The MP from Wellingboro added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to fly the Checkers plan."
Voicing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in global wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The speculation that the British people have changed their mind and wanting to stay is completely untrue."
The champion of Brexit, a member of the Tories Andreas Jenkins, was also in the protest and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chekers project does not have the acceptance of the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and down we are elected.
Please let the Checkers plan go and start listening."
With a sharp message to Mrs. May, she added: "Privats keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the protest gathering that politicians should be forced to 'press the pressure' if they are prepared to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"The question now arises of trust between us - the people - and the order of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we're not gonna let you get away with it if you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the class of our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the proponents of EU stay protested in Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
Few activists were abducting Toris banner against Brexit after group gathering this weekend.
Lord Adonis slain Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with a party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the same people who tell us that they can put into operation the information systems and all the technological means they need for the EU-Canada agreement by enrichment, for the uninterrupted borders, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It doesn't mean good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously consider running the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts spoke of her future plans during a gathering at a West Massachusetts Town Hall on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticises President Donald Trump, claims to be re-elected in November, rival the Republican State spokesperson Jeff Dell, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly assumed that it can be measured with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was her 36th voter meeting using the Mayor's structures since Trump's term began.
One attending the meeting asked if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that means a woman needs to be at the top.
Arrest for the deadly shooting of the basketball player of LSU Sims
The police at Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday, announced the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of the basketball player of LSU Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11pm.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot deadly near the University of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wade Sims suffered a bullet in his head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to Website Network 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene holding a gun and confessed he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is being held in the Police Department of the East Baton Rouge district.
Higher student Sims, 1,98, played in Baton Rouge in 32 matches, with 10 performances as the main player last season, with an average of 17,4 minutes, 5,6 points and 2,9 rebounds per race.
Grand Prin of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is going for a world title, as his team's instructions handed the victory over Sebastian Fetel
It became clear since Valerie Botas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
At the starting point, Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called Fetelel to attack his holobe.
Fetelle went first to the pit and let Hamilton run in the tail of the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit a round after and went out behind Fetel, but Hamilton came out in front of a wheel fight, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly abandon the interior due to a risk of falling into the double motion to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstapen started from the last place and was seventh at the end of his first round on the 21st birthday.
Then he remained first for a large part of the race, as he kept his tires aiming to end quickly and to pass in front of Kimi Raconen in the fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Ryconen came fourth.
It's been a long day because Valerie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did excellently and did one or two," Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finestein at a meeting on Saturday to insist that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blazey Ford, to which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the statement made by Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, commenting instead that what was said in the Senate proved to be "baked and disgraceful and liar."
"The only thing that could happen to this beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate over the last few days, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and miserable and miserable and disgusting and liars," he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Finestein, did you do the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document... "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak," he added by imitating the senator.
Finestein received Ford’s letter containing details of the charges against Cavanaugh in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the leak was from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," Finstein told the committee as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep her confidential, and I kept her confidential as she asked me to."
But her refusal did not seem particularly convinced by the president, who commented during the Saturday gathering: "I will tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language in the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of three women for sexual harassment, the president let it be understood that the Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
You see the maliciousness, misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get power and control," the president said according to Mediaite news website.
Elite Ling: Dadi Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants across to Dante.
Dandy Stars was atonemented for her defeat at Friday's Elite Ling game by Belfast Giants, winning the 5-3 reunion in Dandy on Saturday.
The Giants got an easy head start with two goals with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviyer shots.

François Busar balanced for Dante and then two goals from Lucas Ludwald Nilsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat on Elit Ling in the season for the men of Adam Kif, who came with a 2-1 score on Dandy at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants getting the victory in the three previous races.

Air traffic controller loses his life to escape hundreds of airplane passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life trying to secure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are ignored because of a major earthquake that hit the island of Sulawazi on Friday, causing tsunami.
Strong metastases continue to damage the area and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palos.
However, even though his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonyus Gounawan Ang refused to leave his place in the control tower that was shaking, at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Pale.
He remained in place to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the take-off runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Shirett, said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as Australia's ABC News broadcast.
We prepared a helicopter from Balipan to Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in the Old.
"We're shocked at his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster response service says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutong is limited.
"The number of dead is believed to increase further, as many bodies are still under ruins, while many of them have not been able to achieve them," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purguo Noungroho.
Waves that arrived six meters destroyed the Old, which will be a massive burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Rosa Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
The fresh water's too little.
The minimarkets are looting everywhere."
Jean Gelphant, President of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Jocko Windondo arrived at the Old Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work nights to carry out any evacuation-related work.
Are you ready?" relayed CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which cost more than 550 people life.
Air Niugini crash in Micronesia now says a man is missing after an aircraft crash in a lake
The airline conducting a flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier he said that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the submerged aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release stated that since Saturday afternoon she is unable to find the trails of a man passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to locate the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Vessels in the area helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the crash in the water as he was trying to land at the airport of Chuck Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were left at the hospital on Saturday and the situation was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought the plane went through the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down very low.
"That's extremely good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to move through the water that reached them to the middle of the emergency escape exits of the submerged plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicked and yelled, and he suffered slight head injury.
The U.S. Warship reported that some sailors working there near to improve a dock also helped rescue using a inflatable boat to carry people to the shore before the sinking of the ship at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline collisions registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but in neither of these conflicts was Air Niugini involved.
Analyst cites the timetable of the night when a woman burned alive
The accuseing authority completed its speech on Saturday in the repeat trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Ministry of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlet testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used mobile phone records to set up 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and his 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlet said that he received location files from various cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, disguising his previous claims, reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers' phone the time he claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the accuseing authority asked him if Tellus was telling the truth he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "Say lying, why my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact details from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is going to start her speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he estimates that later that day the trial will be placed in the jury judgment.

Nanny in New York sues couple who fired her after receiving a "racist" message
A Nanny from New York is treating a couple for racist dismissal after a message that the mother accidentally sent her where the last complained that the nanny was "another black man."
The couple refuses to be racist, assimilating the treatment to "extortion".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new Nanny Giselle Morris was black, just the last one appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her gappa, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, now awkward, fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, had done no good work and waited for her place a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for her one and only day of work and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mrs Morris has filed a complaint against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and claims a $350 compensation daily for the six-month period of work as an internal nanny, for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he said to Post on Friday, and he added, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple contradicts the allegations that they are racist, saying that it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared they would not be able to trust her again after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had insulted, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Likened to "extortion," Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you be chasing someone in this situation?
It's not that nice," the bank investor added.
While the legal case is under way, the public court has rushed to condemn the couple on social media, condemning them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers wouldn't be interested in a talking teddy bear, as he reveals a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a little after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the place of someone who was reading it for the first time before he was issued.
It's a lot of fun knowing what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who worked as a pictor at the BBC before inspiring to write the children's book from a yellow bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweety," as her father left last year's life.
About Paddington, who describes as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a quite quiet man, and he wasn't arrogant," he said.
"But because Pantington was so real in his eyes, he was almost like having a child who's accomplishing something: you're proud of it even if it's not your accomplishment in fact.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he was a creation of his own and his imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital of Nice Louis Paster 2, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nade kept calling me and said it was too bad, she didn't have much hope to do it," said Ednan-Laperooz.
"Sometimes Nad called me to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Taci, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly declining and coming out of her body.
He had already died a while ago and at that time, and now it was all erased.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouz, who has so far lamented the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who were ignoring the test she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and they ran tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was inside the plane, I had a feeling of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who mourn the loss of their own people hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones from suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers one can call to receive support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she started to suffer from depression and killed herself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was lighting up the room."
However, he left his job before he died as he was in a very bad state.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had put an end to his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm worried that there will be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you need to speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, just after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt down or sad or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had toast on Christmas Day -- when the kids opened their presents, he wouldn't look at them in the eyes."
He said his death caused a huge wound to them, but they have to get over it: "He's tearing the family apart.
It's crushing us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain, as the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited and limited investigation - perhaps we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, while adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved in the middle of trapped party deadlocks.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to carry out an investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The interim elections are in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person they wish in the country's Supreme Court.
George Walker Bush calls senators, pressing them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report was presented?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still not clear if Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Penns, the vice president, to get the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of apostates in North Korea falls under Kim's authority
The number of apostates from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Young Eun came to power seven years ago, according to a legislator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, reporting from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1.127 distances last year, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges for traffickers were key factors.
Pyonyang hasn't made any public comments.
The vast majority of apostates from North Korea are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the severely protected Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the apostate illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often deports them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, typically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyonyang to discuss the negotiations on nuclear decommissioning, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Young Eun in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to cooperate to demolition the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jung Il accused US sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, we will in no way disarm our country unilaterally first," said Mr. Rim in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozi calls Bret Cavanaugh "later," says she's inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Democratic president of the Nancy Pelozi Parliament called candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavanaugh "later" and said he is self-sufficiently inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelozi made these comments at an interview on Saturday in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman were to behave in this way, they would call her "sterile" commented on the testimony of Kavana before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with intense excitement, denied charges that he had sexual assaulted Dr. Christine Blizzie Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes shouting, and his voice trembled as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats in the committee, describing the charges against him as "terrestrial and coordinated political murder of character", organised by liberals who have been angry at the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelozi said she believed that Cavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not serve the Supreme Court, as she showed that she was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he blocked himself out with these statements and with the way he succeeded against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozi reacted when she was asked whether she would try to reproach Cavanaugh if his appointment were confirmed and whether the Democrats were able to obtain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he is not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court to which he is currently serving," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge at the Regional Court of Columbia Region (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozi added that as a Democratic worry about Cavanaugh’s possible decisions on the Approdable Care Act or Roy v Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and say, "Not great?" Pelozi said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of rage, and she can't get it out of her inside without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was very helpful to a woman who was a stem somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
So he just kept going.
And it seemed great to me."
The tears are allowed as an outburst of anger partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my greatest memories of an old job, in an office where men were dominating, is once that I cried with unspeakable anger and grabbed me from the neck of an older woman - a cold director that I always feared slightly - and pulled me on a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they're gonna be happy because they broke your ass."
Patricia Schröder, then a Democratic Senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught having entered into an unmarried relationship on a vessel named Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs Schröder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of putting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision" she said to me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven more candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone described the situation as Snow White and the seven dwarfs.
Because the campaign had already started for some time, it was back in funding, so it swore that it would not enter the election race unless it had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men were giving her $250.
"They think I have a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives and anger with sexism - who felt a knot in the neck.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown" remembers Mrs. Schroeder about the press reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Has she cried?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can do good in Beijing
Greetings of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and while the battle has too much to end, a rupture between the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
American President Donald Trump dropped the first warning shot this year, taxing basic Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The greatest escalation has evolved this week, imposing new duties on US $200 million (150 million in England), in fact by taxing half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Beijing returns fire each time in kind, and recently imposed duties of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to return American fires and the world's second largest economy is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to make Washington retreat, it will have to give in to their demands, but to worship publicly in the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards properly, American pressures in the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic collapse in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have admitted in the past," Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, at the Center for New American Security (Center for a New American Security), a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to the Foreign Minister.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country's destroyed by the seven-year (more than) war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that hit their everyday lives and biopoverty.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Mualem said aid for the reconstruction of the destroyed country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe Locks Victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Winter Cup 2018, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 on the Le Golf National golf course, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now lost six times on European soil and has to win the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took first place again, as the group of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mikelston, who fought hard in the longest season of the tournament, threw his shot in the water in the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari victory.
The Italian golf Molinari player shone in all his rounds and thus became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spring was defeated on 5&4 by the lowest in the ranking of the European team, Danus Thorbjorn Olsen.
The best ranking player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has achieved 2 and 1 against Ian Pulter from England, who may have played his last game in Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia, crowned the most winning European of all seasons in the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we took the cup back.
Everything is for the team and I'm glad to be able to help," Garcia was moved after the European victory.
He's giving the bitch to John Ram's compatriot who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career record at the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and has only exceeded Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time this weekend finding a target, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American chief Jim Farik spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At some times this morning we pushed a lot on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Commission and move forward.
I love these 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
