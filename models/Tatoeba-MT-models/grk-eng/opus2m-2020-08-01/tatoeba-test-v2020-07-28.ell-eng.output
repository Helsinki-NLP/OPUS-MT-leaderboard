Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have any secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than I am.
Tom's living in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows everything about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you get on the exams.
I think two languages aren't enough.
Could you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should talk about them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three o'clock.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to know French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish is not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student, Jutsu.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is it all right?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you're working?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do this right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need fresh air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
Time and place of meeting have been closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
The garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want anything to eat.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What glows isn't gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
My phone's ringing.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
You're a journalist?
Tom's a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who he was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is that?
Tom forgot his suitcase in the train.
They killed our cattle.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie cove.
The water's hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was urgent.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come yet?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom's gonna live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canady?
People today attach more importance to people's culture than to the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you paint your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We might need some.
That's a proposition.
How did you spend the vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Oh, do we have a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find them for you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house is totally destroyed.
Tom got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who this is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her phone.
I wanted to die.
Same thing does to me whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not a question of money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like human beings.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust foreigners.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
Turn 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain has appointed us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her in love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
What do you call that?
Laurie's still in school.
My office is downtown.
She's got two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We spent three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom wears gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks French in vain.
I'm taller than you are.
Have you lost proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm unbiased.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom's your teacher.
News cheered him up.
We were enemies.
Who's got him?
We have no place to go.
How many blocks can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?
Tom's from Boston.
Tom drinks every day.
The cat's under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't see a TV at all.
I'm the coach.
Tom will be working this afternoon.
Who's that?
Dinner.
Convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the riddles.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll watch you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom pink painted the wall.
We're too busy.
Harder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Good!" cried out.
It worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm a homosexual.
You're easy to believe.
He's not a hero, Tom.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
That was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.
Russia is big.
Teacher's friendly.
You ruined her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for a long time.
I'm Harvard's graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I did what I was asleep on.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
Snow made visibility difficult.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now is your chance.
You can choose any book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom's not Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
Did you think I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I have not received an answer to my letter.
Can I borrow your gun?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I read him.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is a Turk.
Can you remove from ten o'clock?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
Tell her you'd like to go.
He's smart.
When are you going on a vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There's no salt left.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I broke out in tears.
He's talking like a truck driver.
When are you reading?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he doesn't tell the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could imagine.
It's gonna be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came and prepared me dinner.
I would like to speak all European languages.
Seven is considered a lucky number.
Where are your dresses?
I can't tell for sure what's going to happen.
Tom paid.
I'm not at all tired.
They're red.
He said something.
Since I got married, I haven't worked anymore.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a mare?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm kind of tired, too.
Are you sure you can't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking slowly.
Come with us.
Nobody wants to take responsibility.
His father's Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm in the middle now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
This would never have happened in Boston.
I like to play piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.
I have to read.
I want you to stay.
What are you reading?
We're not happy.
She's as smart as he is.
Where do you feed them?
Tell her to leave.
There's only three of them.
I have more money than he does.
He has Ukrainian citizenship.
The name of this song is "Only You".

I want you to come.
I need his name.
Can I stay in the car?
I have friends in Boston.
I don't speak Spanish.
Tell him to come home.
I can't keep up to see all the time.
Tom usually pays for everything in cash.
You're not gonna enjoy it.
Where's Tom sleeping?
He doesn't smoke.
Tell me the good news first.
You thought I was Canadian?
Tell them I'm ready.
I need pens and paper.
Open your eyes.
We'll see.
Tom has to stay.
I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
How about a drink?
And Greek worms eat fish.
They were cooperative.
No one encouraged him.
He dreamed he was kissing him.
What's the title of your new book?
We have each other.
He made the same mistake twice.
Tom heard Mary crying.
I saw him go out.
Tom will never let that happen.
Do you see me?
Tom bought a dog.
I like to eat pineapple.
He wants to go to America.

I really love you.
How about a drink?

My name is Sarah.
I can't drink tea without sugar.
Welcome to the team.
Please repeat what I say.
The library's on the left.
Are you awake?
Where are you talking French?
You know you're getting old when you have to explain to a Greek who Melina Mercouri was.
Who cares?
Tell me what you want.
First God
I know your older brother pretty well.
He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?
Is he Japanese?
Tell Tom I went fishing.
All right, try again.
Tom and Mary need help.
Kids look scared.
Tom took off his hat.
I want to see the streets.
Which one is mine?
Algeria is relatively safe now.
Tom's gonna help me.
You're very rich.
We don't have tea left.
All visitors are gone.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I'd been born Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I wasn't involved in the conversation.
Be careful: In English and we demolute the nationalities, the days of the week, and the languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril. I'm glad to meet you.
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is, you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's sleeping.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sami peeed and shit in Lila's toilet.
When I grow up, I'm going to be a pilot.
Do you have any sugar?
I went home.
Language is a living organization.
Can you help Tom?
Listen, I need to see you.

We laughed.
Take me with you.
I have to go to bed.
Both of them are alive.
They'll fix him up.
Tom flew from Boston to Chicago.
Help me get her up.
This country is very poor.

Tom will be there to meet you.
You made the same mistake again.
Kate's not celebrating her birthday almost ever.
How much do you want to get paid for?
Aren't you happy?
Forgive Tom.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
It's exactly what you need now.
I've been doing some research.
Do you feel tired?
It's still shallow, huh? My feet still lie on the bottom.
I left for London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid of losing your money?
It's cold. Why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
Birds are red.
Get me a glass.
I need more money.
They all speak French to them.
Whenever I hear this song, Tom comes to mind.
We've been in circles for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not illiterate.
I'm eating.
Your friend's here.
I'm over thirty.
Don't put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, admit it, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?
Tom's John's brother.
Are you sure Tom can do that?
He's got a lot of money.
You better be honest with me, or I'll tell our mother.

His money's in the bank.
I'm too shy.
I love my country.
We've been in a serious conversation.
They've come.
I guess someone likes Tom.
You're going to visit me?
"Why don't you go?" 'Cause I don't want to."
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the celebration.
As the phone rang, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary wore her best dress.
Tom's undecided.
Tom can speak both French and English.
Tom predicted Mary would do that.
I can't leave.
I'm an agnostic.
He wants to know how to cook.
I'll start with a tomato soup...
I need you.
Are you all right?
This book belongs to Paolo.
It doesn't seem like Tom's Canadian.
I don't understand any French at all.
They'll fix him up.

Can I try it?
You're much faster than I am.

Tom has a brother.
Who shot them?
She's been writing me less and less these days.
Put it on.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something down.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom pushed his nose into the window.
You're younger than I am.
She eats.
I need your car.
Tom thinks Mary killed John.
I'll get it.
I got here at 2:30.
You might be right.
Oxygen is essential for combustion.
Everything all right?
You're unbelievable.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thanks.
Only I can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom owed Mary money.
Tom doesn't drive fast.
His current attitude confirms what we guessed.
Tom told me he'd like to visit Boston.
Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
Harder.
Don't be so tough on your son.
Her question is very difficult to answer.
Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're vibrant.
You convinced me.
She's my daughter.
I was talking to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm shy.
We're going to make a visit to our friends.
I'm having a lot of frequency.
And speaking of genocide, today is Columbus Day.
Sami hired another maid.
I want some orange juice.
The entrance to the toilet is very dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to go now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our trouble.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary's answering the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I get drunk at least once a month.
I want to have some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't look for this word in the dictionary, I don't know the Arab alphabet.
Answer the question.
The problem is, you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I missed the last two lessons.
I'd like to have an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page 10.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room I could barely move.
He's going to visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom has blue eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.

We're here first.
I'm smarter than him.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I was eating something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is too small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everyone started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a good theory, the only disadvantage I think has is probably common to all the philosophical theories.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He's spending a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm so mad right now.
I thought you were Japanese.
It's too much trouble here.
Who saw you?
She's bigger than her.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
The tongue is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the highest of the three.
You asked them to wait?
He's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.
Is Tom going to die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain unanswered.
I like Irish music.
Give me a spoon.
What's your height?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a difficult language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I should have tea.
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Mary has a long hair.
I'm exhausted.
I know what's her name.
Thank you for coming, guys, I'll see you in the next lesson.
That's Tom's dog.
I know he's hiding something.
Tom moved his head.
I just happened to meet her at the store.
Tom's trying to learn French.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Don't you remember them?
I'm coughing.
Tell them I'll do it.
Do you have the source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
I'm sorry?
Where did you find the key?
Could that not be right?
Tom can't stand the hot and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, call me tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful that you don't need makeup.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as he could take his legs.
I like fishing.
I don't like these candy.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.
Tom ate an orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Yes, sir.
It's true!
Can I use your phone?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love mushrooms.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was so hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the paperwork.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I pretended I was asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary's being vigilant about strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Slow down.
Put the book on the others.
The bird's in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canaanese.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Can you text them?
Can I borrow a pencil?
We only have three options.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom snores.
Don't turn on the light.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously miserable.
You're not a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom insisted.
Thank you, you're fantastic!
Will Israel attack Iran?
I like to laugh.
I washed my shirt.
We'll talk later.
Eating more slowly will help you to feel more full.
I'm French.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Yesterday I got up early.
Tom's helping Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father's rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll make up my mind.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
French isn't hard.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
It always repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Stephen's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him.
They're Japanese?
Why does she hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
How long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay real estate.
That's a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a account.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father's gone.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's never been to Okinawa before.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus ride isn't boring.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first, I couldn't understand it.
I'm talking Esperado.
California's boring.
I'm happy!
All of them are Canadians.
You're not welcome.
She's a very pretty girl.
He's helping him.
Nothing's missing.
He started singing.
That's a menu.
I wasn't drunk.
She wants you to kiss her.
Tom was here a minute ago.
I had a rough day.
His mother speaks Italian.
I'll give her a tip.
Where are the girls?
You won't be alone.
Tell her I don't want to go.
I saw her take it.
I like sports.
I have money.
I was waiting for you at 2:30.
I don't think it's good for you to go out with him.
I won't tell anyone about you.
Tom sang some old songs.
