==La kumulativa incidence de coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases (COVID-19) figuran similar trends in European Union/Economic Area and United Kingdom and the United Kingdom confirmer that, at at a different stade dependend on the país, la pandemia COVID-19 progressive rapidement in all pays.
==Based on the experience from Italy, the pays, hospitals and intensive care units, purification of the COVID-19, purgando, determinados pacientes, COVID-19, purga, purga, intensiv cursor.
Den 31 december 2019, in Wuhan, Province Hubei, China, rapporto de un cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology.
1.1.1920, 1988, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a roman coronavirus, denominat now as sever Syndrome akuta respirator coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Sigaden, la maladie resultate de SARS-COV-2-infection is name coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
==Evidences today is that ca 80% of individus with COVID-19 have a left malady, t.e. a tract respirator infection with or free pneumonia, and the plumonia of these recuperation.
==In cas 14%, COVID-19 development in a severy disease que require hospitalization, mens residual 6% case existent critical maladies, necessariamente intensiv care.
==================================================================
==In this studio, nos evaluamos trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in cada European Union/Economic Area (EU/EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) and compare thes with the province of Hubei, China.
===============================================================================================================

COVID-19 subquenced to China, COVID-19 submetted ulterior geografic spriend and the dinamic of the pandemie of the COVID-19 in the rest of the World actually seguive the of this pays.
11:11.2020, le director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declarava a pandemia COVID-19.
====================================================================================================================================
==In EU/EEA, in the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed case blee rapported by France on 24 January 2020, in persons return off Wuhan, Province Hubei, China.
==Ant 15 March 2020, in all 30 EU/EEA-landes and the United Kingdom (UK), in all 30 EU/EEA-cases (United Kingdom), which between 31 december 2019 and the date included, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths has notificated, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy solo.
¶ Obtention of cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
==In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), notified COVID-19 case in cada worldwide, obtened only official sources, tal como le Ministerium of Health, national and regional sane and the WHO and the WHO, updated day at 8:00 a.m.
== Destinatariososos figures COVID-19 in EU/EEA and britain, adequated to the COVID-19, comparation to it in Italy.
== Proxy of the prevalence of active cases COVID-19, nos calculamos 14-days interrunted incidence cumulative of COVID-19 cases, solucionalmente, teknolojio la natural cursus de COVID-19, in cada EU/EEA and the UK, durante periode de 1 January–15 March 2020.

==This was drewing maximalment by the rapid augmentation of the number of cases rapported from Italy, but all alternative states EU/EEA and britain shows similarly crewing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplement material).

==Les trends observatives in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggestionen, que la pandemia progresa per una comparabilitativa velocità in alle países.
==This is understand the different stades, variations of national health responses, and potentielly different case definitions in the states and different protocols for selecting patients, which must are test for confirmation of COVID-19, inclusive catch-up test.
==Ancho March 2020 ==Doktors in the affected regions of Italy describe una situación in which ca 10% of pacients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions have already the maximum capacity.
== Data on admitting of COVID-19 cases in hospital and/o un intensiv care unit existing actually on EU/EEA level for just 6% and 1% cases, respectivamente (data non disponible).
Sin embargo, simultanea, de forma systematika, de recollectionary to complement current data de surveillance, que fokusează sur numero de cases rapported and the number of deaths.
==En studio realizado en 2010–11 visa un grande variation in disponibility of intensive care and intermedial care beds in Europa, variation of 29.2 in Germany tot 4.2 beds per 100 000 population in Portugal.
== Tastique========================================================================================
==Scenarios relativos à saturation de kapacite sanitaire, bina estimulations for cada EU/EEA-land and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalized cases COVID-19 associated with a & gt; 90% risk of over intensive care bed bed capacity, figuras in the sexte update of the ECDC rapid risk evaluation on COVID-19.
== Dans que des cases existes in certains regions in EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units of generally servies a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds were preferiblely disponible at the Nomenklature of territoriale units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) niveau.
* Experience des Italias and the current trends in the andere pays demonstrants that the pandemie COVID-19 progress rapidly in EU/EEA and britain.
==Cartes, hospitales and intensive care units should it se prepare selfs for a scenario of durable community transmission of SARS-COV-2 of SARS-COV-2 and un augmentation of the number of patients with COVID-19 the need salude, and particularly intensive care, som something the ocurred in the affected regions of Italy.
81. Tal como deklare in la recente evaluation rapid risk ECDC, es essential de un rapid, proaktiv and complete approxy for tarting the propanding of SARS-COV-2, bland annurament destinativos à un approximacion de reduktion, definition de rapid augmentation in numero de cases potest necessariamente proporcionar decisionsfactors and hospitals profitly time for comprension, acceptar and adapting their response conformely, if not implemented ante time.

Sin embargo, cee que intermedia host helped the virus cross the species barrier for infect humans, continua today unknown, and the transmission route is notly elucided.

Exception de 3 virus faktors ovan, interaktion viral avec host receptors es un aparte clave factor influencing on interspecies transmission.
==Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV sea current como un tipic exemplu, qui apresenta prova de positiv selection durante interspecies transmission events.
== Based on the comparative analyse between isols of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV es pensible que SARS-CoV submet rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
==Generalment, RBD in the S protein of a CoV interagis with the cellular receptor and is intensive selection by the host response anticorbos.
