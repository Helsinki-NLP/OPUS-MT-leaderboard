81 La cumulativa incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases (COVID-19) demonstra similar trends in European Union/Economic Area European European European European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom confirm that, when a different fase depend on the pay, pandemia COVID-19 progress rapid in total pays.
81 Base sur l'experience de Italia, lands, hospitals and intensive cure units, bør augmentera preparation of a support of a patients with COVID-19 which be need sains sains, en particular intensive care.
= 31 December 2019, in Wuhan, Province Hubei, China, rapportaron un cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology.
== 9 January 2020, The China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent som a roman coronavirus now name as severy akut respirator syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
{1} Sedan, SARS-COV-2-infection is name the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
81 Evidence today is that ca 80% of individus with COVID-19 has a blew disease, t.e. a infection tract respiratory with or non pneumonia, and the majority of this recover.
© In ca 14% case, COVID-19 developpet in a besoalisation plus severa maladi, quant que rest 6% case disparse kritic maladies, necessaire intensiv cuir.
81 La mortalidad de patients hospitalizate provocation de COVID-19 is ca 4%.
© In this studie, evaluarem les tendences in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in cada European Union/Economic Area (EU/EEEA) and United Kingdom (UK) in cada land European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with the province of Hubei, China.
81 We comparedem de numéro COVID-19 cases in UE/EEA and the UK with that in Italy in Italie in the 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA lands and the United States
81 Subsequent to China, COVID-19 promovió norme geografic diffeld and the dinamic of the COVID-19 pandemie in the rest of the World currently follow that of this pay.
© 11 March 2020, le director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declarou COVID-19 a pandemia.
81 In de 5 March de Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first European confirmad COVID-19 cases conforme a definition de definition WHO.
81 In EU/EEA, France 24 january 2020 right the first three confirmate case were rapported by the first confirmate case, in the persons return of Wuhan, Province Hubei, China.
© Samo le 15 March 2020, COVID-19-case era detekted in total 30 lands EU/EEA and United Kingdom (UK), which between 31 december 2019 and the date included, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have verified rapported, better 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths of Italy just.
■ obtinuant cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
© Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), le notified COVID-19 case in cada land globale, objected only official sources, talk of the pays Minister of Health, national and regional health of the WHO and the WHO, tie updated cada day at 8:00 a.m.
81 http://ec.europa.eu/euro.europa.eu/eA.C.E./europa.eu/e.europa.eu
© Come proxy of the prevalence of active cases COVID-19, nos calculamos la 14 day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, probablement teknoloze le covID-19, in cada land EU/EEA and the UK, in the 1 January–15 March 2020 periode.
81 We presente adequate the cumulative numero of cases notificate of cada pays, le 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m., comparated with that of Italy for period 31 January–15 March 2020.
} Trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
81 The tendences in the 14-day trunced cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK generally followed the province of Hubei (China) province (Figure 1) (Figure 1).
© For EU/EEA and the United Kingdom Completed, la cumulative incidence of COVID-19 encendula circa 21 February, através de 28 Februar 2020 (supplementare materiale) izanged.
{1} It's massimalyly provocated by the rapid augmenting in the numero of rapported cases of Italy, maar total other EU/EEEA lands and the UK presented similar cress thendens of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplement material).
81 figure 2 visa la cumulativa numero de cases COVID-19, in lands EU/EEA and the UK, comparated with that in Italy for period 31 January–15 March 2020.
́It undersights that, le 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 andere land EU/EEA and UK has reporte already total case comparable to the Italia of Italy just 3 week previous or menos.
81 Our resultates indika que number of notificate cases of COVID-19 cresce rapidmente in EU/EEA and UK.
81 The observate tendences in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggestiones, dass le pandemia progress a un comparable veloce in total pays.
:This is malgré pays existing at different fase, variations of national health responses, and possible different case definitions in lands and different protocols for select patients que mussin ser tests for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up test.
81 Principal March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy deskribe un situation in cui ca 10% de patients with COVID-19 necessited intensive care and media sources reports that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions has already accomplid our maximum capacity.
81 Data on admiting of COVID-19 cases in hospital and/o un intensive care unit now disponible at EU/EEA niveau for just 6% and 1% cases, respectivament (data non disponible).
81 Well, obe should to collected in a systematic mode for complementar current surveillance datas que fokus surveillances on the numere of rapported cases and the number of deaths.
81 Un studio provenit in 2010–11 a manifestaron a grande variation in disponibility of intensive care and intermedium beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany tot 4.2 beds per 100 000 population in Portugal.
81 Tali 意味着, ter territoire can have plus o menos ressources than Italia (12.5 intensive care and intermedia care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).
Derivate scenaries de modelling relating to saturation of saturation of sanitification of sanitification in sanitification, because estimulations for cada land EU/EEA and the UK of prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases association with a &gt; 90% risk of super intensive bed capacity, presented in the sexte update of the ECDC rapid risk evaluation on COVID-19.
81 Dafter cases has long clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally servis a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive beds intensive care beds, preferiorly sea display in the Nomenclature of territoral units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) niveau.
81 The experience of Italy and current tendences in andere pays demonstrant que pandemia COVID-19 progress rapid in EU/EEA and UK.
81 Pays, hospitals and intensive custom units, decir, bør prepare selfs for un scenario of supported community transmissing of SARS-COV-2 and a augmenting in the numero of patients with COVID-19 were need sains, en particular intensive care, talk som okay in the affected regions of Italy.
81. Like tolded in the recent ECDC rapid risk evaluation, a rapid, proactive and complete approcess is essencial for tarting the breading of SARS-COV-2, with a transmission from a intention to a limitation approcess, aghsodies que la rapid augmentation in the number of cases can't not of the description decisions and hospitals for new suffice time for compreency, accepte and adapting their reading, conforme, if not implemented to previous, if not implemented.
81 La rapid risk evaluation listes des mesures public health for minimizar l'effect de la pandemia.
81 Has un short find of opportunits in which pays have possibility for current control sfores for lancering the breading of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on sains.
Å¡empty, probabbilment only systems of the andere pays EU/EEEA va fronte a solution de patients que necessited intensiv cuir intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
81 L'evolution of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), provocate per severo respirator syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), has fall mort over 3,000 personas, infected over 80,000 in China and anders in the World, resultant in catastrophe for humans.
81 Similar a su homologous virus, SARS-COV, que provoca SARS in miles de persons in 2003, SARS-COV-2, võis eventualmente transmissive from the bats and cause similar symptoms per un similar mechanism.
Men, COVID-19 ha inferior severity and mortality than SARS, men is much more transmissive and affect the mas elders than youth and mas malls than women.
́An reage to the rapid multiply publications on the emergency math, this artikel essaye apresentar una revisión timeout and complete of the rate development the research the theme.
́Vi ecovery the bases on the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnostic, tratament, prognose, and prevention of the maladi.
81 Elkepte vulgane necessaire de responses, hopeas, at hijja's review helps to compreency and elimination of the through math.
81 The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020, has besondered un memory for all Chinese, which for the Chinese, which is inspirated a holde in home for all the feeling and for multe weeknes after a causa de breakfast de una nova virus maladi.
} The virus is high homologous for the coronavirus (COV), qui provocat un franching of sever agute respirator syndrome (SARS) (SARS) in 2003; probabilmente, SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on february 11, 2020, and the associate male is name CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
81 The epidemie started in Wuhan, China, and rapide rapided in tota lateral territorium, account 50 anderes universum.

[1] WHO advertise que COVID-19 is "public enemice number 1" and potential plus potencial than terrorism.
81 Segun PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in menos de 2 months, over 200 documents existes publiced on COVID-19, including his virologie, epidemiology, etiologie, diagnostic, and tratament, desde the first rapport on January 7, 2020, care determinat the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
́This review essayes to resume the research progress in the new and rate development the subject area.
81. Kada possible, essayamos comparar COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-cased-dise, Middle East respirator syndrome (MERS, a fraunce in 2012).
81 També ændremos discutir today, today, course to prevention and prognose of the maladi, association of the male, association of the male, association of the restore to urgente questions.

01.24 january 24, la primere studio klinical on the maladie reported, que, av 41 patients with confirmated cases, just 21 has direct contact with the Wohan march seafood market, care foi considered the start site of the infection of a unnotified animal source.
1 January 30, WHO declarerada declaration forward un emergency global health.
81 Vecture of this rapport, the male is already dispared today China and close 50 andere pays in total world (Fig.2).
§Ast the situation is rapid evolution, la finale ambition and severity of the fraunce continua determinat.
== 11 February 2020, un multicentro-study on 8,866 pacientes, inclusive 4,021 pacientes confirmat COVID-19, presente un illustration more actualizate of the epidemie (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qha2bhdA).
= SARS-COV-2 infected people of all elders, pero principalmente at 30-65 anys.
17; case half (47,7%) of the infected infected persons was over 50 anys, very much was under 20, and just 14 infected individus was under 10.
× SARS-COV-2 infected mai مردs (0,31/100,000)  than women (0,27/100,000).
== COVID-19 ===========================================
COVID-19 zentrade 5 (2-9) dies, from onset to diagnostic.
1 The median incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
× The mediance time from onset to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
1 The base reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), a cadjuat R0 was 2.23-4.82.
81 Ant 23 Jan. 2020, numero de infectiva personas aumentare exponentialment before 23 Jan. 2020, correspondiente l'hora de massive transport ante Festival Spring in China.
81 La mortalidad de patients with confirmate cases was 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%), a la mortalidad de mortalidad de all patients was 3,06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
81 Tres grandi riskfactors for COVID-19 era seks (male), elder (≥60), et sever pneumonia.

81 Human ACE2 existi como receptor for SARS-COV-2, associado de SARS-COV.
17; Sprotein of SARS-COV-2 bindings to human ACE2 plus few rom the of SARS-COV, that is coincident with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causa infection menor sever infection in patients than SARS-COV.
[1] SARS-COV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can form a novea short protein coded by orf3b and a secreted protein coded by orf8.
[1] The orf3b of SARS-COV-2 võis play un rol in the virus patogenity and inhib the expresion of IFNβ; todavia, orf8 inneholder none know function domain or motif.
== 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reporte de la struktura croo-EM de la totale longitude human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
[1] De visite que le complex, que has open and closed conformations, era reunioned como un dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can binding two S protein, which projects for CoV reconnace and infection.
81 B0AT1 võis because a terapeutic target for projecking droga for depress infection SARS-COV-2.
§ The origin and intermed host
{1} nowledged that SARS-COV and MERS-CoV original from bats and transmissions for humans via civet cats and camels, respectivament.
81 Per a phylogenetic comparation of SARS-COV-2 with andere CoVs, bats considered the native host of SARS-COV-2, something the new virus is 96% identic to two SARS-like CoV from bats name bat-SL-COVX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
● Today, cee intermedia host helped the virus cross the species barrier for infecter humans continua unknown, and transmission route ancora dwell elucided.
== Ji, et al., proponede serpents como a transporter of the virus from bats to humans, which impliced recombination homologous recombination in the S protein.
81 Segun un studio, investigators in Guangzhou, China, suggeriert pangolins - long-snouted, ant-eating mammiferes ofte usats in traditional Chinese medicine - is the potential intermedium host of SARS-COV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in a CoV descopert in pangolins and SARS-COV-2.
1% difference sprided over 2 genoms still a grande difference; proto, tienen rezultate definitive for concrete pruebas (Fig. (Fig.33).
§ The physicochemical propacts of SARS-COV-2 instant gradientalmente no existing.
81 SARS-COV and MERS-COV can in vitro survive in vitro du 48 hours in a sech ambiente, fixer 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% fugiment.
= SARS-COV-2 võis posseder similar proprietates.
81 Happen reported, SARS-COV-2 is sensitif for ultraviolet radies and heature at 56 °C per 30 minutes; ether, 75% etanol, chlorine-contain desinfector, peracetic acid, chlorform, and andere solvents fet solvents, pero non chlorhexidine, can effectable inactive the virus.
81 Total population humane generally mank immunity for SARS-COV-2, probablement is susceptible for the roman virus.
© Currently, nema details studio no ġie raportat no informated on the immunological reaction to SARS-COV-2.
81.After, we can just reference to previous studies on other CoVs, specially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Fig.4).
© Generally, post a virus invade the host, lock innate immunsystem innate per patron receptors (PRRs), include receptors C-type-lectin-like-receptors, receptor Toll-like (TLR), receptors (TLR), receptors like NOD (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
81 Per diferents vias, il virus induce l'expression of inflamators, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthese of interferons type I (IFNs), qui limita l'expression of the virus and acceleration the macrophage phagocytose of virus antigens.
♪ Todavia, la N proteina de SARS-COV puede help the virus escape from the immun reations.
Malgrés, le immun reaktion adaptive imun adaptive adaptive lying the luight contra the virus.
81 T limfocytes, include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play un importante rol in the defense.
== CD4+ T cells stimular B cells for production anticorpos-specific virus, and CD8+ T cells direct kill cells-infected- virus.
81 T auxiliar cells produce citokines proinflamator for help the defenseng cells.
1) Today, CoV can inhive T cell functions per inducer apoptose of T cells.
81 The humoral immunity, inklusive complements, tal como C3a, C5a and anticorpos, is essencial for combat the virus infection.
81 Per exemplo, anticorpos isolated from a recuperate patient neutralized MERS-COV.
́An apartment, a reageration of the immun system genera a large radicals libres locals, produce a large radicals, libres radicals, qui can causa grave daños til pulmons and anderes organes, and, in the pire scenario, multi-organ fall and even death.
81 The SARS-COV-2 infection, displayed by cluster onset, is more probably affect alders with comorbidities and gravided women.
81 Welcome see, for mensen, ktere existes a long virus, o cui imun functions compromised, have mayor chance to be infected than anderes.
1-14 days, majority 3-7 days based on a studie of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
● Today, un studio on 1,099 case demonstrar que periode de incubation procente 3 days, promedium de 0 - 24 days.
1 Un recent studio, conforme described october, demonstrar que periode de incubation was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) dies based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
81 Like melodike autoritetetes de saludade adjust the effect carantine time based on the period de incubation meest exacte, prohibition infected, men one symptoms persons of the virus transmit the virus to anderes.
81 Common practice, individers, exposed, of infected by, le virus, normalmente, request to carantine per 14 days.
{1} swesting the carantine time to 24 days?
81 Fever is ofte the major and inicial symptom of COVID-19, care can acompany by symptom or aver symptoms, something tose, shortness of spire, muscle ache, sundament, sundament, cabeza, sakit gorgell, rhinorrhea, door de cesta, diarrea, nauseas, and vemitation.
Parti patients erlebrante dispnea and/o hypoxemia en september post disease of the maladi.
81 In severa case, patients progress rapided to development akut respirator syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidose, and coagulopatia.
81 Pacientes med fever and/o respirator symptoms and acute fever, eventuellement, from sin anormalations pulmonar image, moet fixer for the virus for time diagnose.
81 Un study demográfico in december de 2019 after december demonstrada, demonstrada que le percentages of the symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for such hoss, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for diarrea; 8% of the patients need the ventillation support.
81 Similar rezultate tien reporte in due recent studies of a family cluster and un cluster provocate per transmission of assimptomatic individu.
Derivabellement, un demografic studie in 2012, demonstration demonstral, demonstrada, demonstrada que MERS-COV patients has fever (98%), such hoss (47%), et dispnea (55%), like their principale symptoms.
* Today, 80% van ellos necessaire support de ventilation, multo de pacientes de COVID-19, en conformité avec la mortalidad de MERS superior de COVID-19.
81 Diarrhea (26%) and hurge gorgele (21%) editioned with MERS patients.
81 In patients SARS, happende demonstrat, feber (99%-10%), such those (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), diarrea (20-25%), diarrea (13-25%), were gross (13-25%), is the grand symptoms and ventilation support is necess for ca. 14%-20% of the patients.
[1] En 14 February, de mortalidad de COVID-19 existivo 2% quando le confirmate case accounts 66,576 global.
També, SARS’s mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmats cases.
81 For MERS, based on un demografic studie in June 2012, mortaliteit was 37% of 2,494 case confirmed.
81 Un anterior studio reporte que R0 of SARS-COV-2 was so long as 6,47 with a 95% confiance interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, mens the R0 of SARS-COV is only varied from 2 to 4.
81 A comparation of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV relative our symptoms, mortaliteit, and R0 presented in Tabel1.1.
81 figures over suggests, SARS-COV-2 ha a capacitate superior de sprindender than MERS-CoV and SARS-COV, pero it's menor fatal than the last two.
{1}}Aftinformación de SARS-COV-2, beautiful de controle epidemie de SARS-COV-2 quam de MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
81 Clustered onset ofte software okay in the same family ofte okay of the same collection or vehicle, como un cruise bark.
81 Pacients ofte aways has un history of travel or resident in Wuhan or in ander områdes affected of contact with infected individus or patients infected in the recent 2 weeks before the onset.
ແຕ່, happena reporte que persons can carry the virus with symptoms long than 2 weeknes and save the patients of hospitals output can carry the virus, kit insert un alarm for aumentar the time for carantine.

== Por exemplo, lymphopenia with blank cells count &lt; 4×109/L inklusive lymphocytes count &lt; 1×109/L, and elevate aspartate aminotransferase niveaus and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
81 Enzyms heavy, muscle enzyme and myoglobin exists heavy augmented in some patients, existing the niveau of leper and musclear enzyms and myoglobin in blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were augmentated in the blood of the majority patients.
81 In patients with sever cases, niveau of D-dimer, un degradation de fibrín present in the blood, existed to high, and limfocytes number in progressive reduced.
81 Abnormalitas in radiography brain visibles in la mayoría de COVID-19 patients, displayed by bilaterale patchy shadows or gross opacity in the pulmons.
81 Pacients ofte develope un atypic pneumonia, angustia aguta pulmon, et sindrome respiratorial respirator (ARDS).
81 When ARDS success, inflamation inkontrolled, fluides acumulation, and progressive fibrose severo compromis the gas exchange.
81 Dysfunction of type-I and tip-II pneumocytes dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduce the surfactant niveau and augmenting the surfactory tension surfactory, aumentant superficial tension, to reduce la capacity of pulmons for expand and highting the risk of colapsing pulmon.
81.Ambient, le pire radiographic rezultate ofte parlail le plus grave grad de la maleta.
== 18 February 2020, la primera patologyka analyse de COVID-19 demonstrada la desquameration of pneumocytes, hialine membrana formation, et interstitial lymfocyti infiltration, and multinucleated synchytical cells in pulmons of a patient which morts of the sakit, something the pathologie of virus infection and ARDS and something of SARS and MERS.
} Detection of SARS-COV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase cadena polymerase reaction (RT-PCR), foi utilisada como the important criteris for diagnose of COVID-19.
[1] Today, zara la false-negative frequency high false-negative rate, que possible accelerar l'epidemie, de manifestations kliniques started a usar for diagnostic (quoi nedefinitivamente on RT-PCR) in China den 13 February 2020.
81 Un similar situation existi hem ved diagnose de SARS.
81. Decision, essencial, effektiv diagnose, effektive diagnostic, effektiv, laboratorium tests, and radiologic research.
== 14 February 2020, The Feng Zhang Group deskribió un protocol de usando the CRISPR based SHERLOCK technik for detecting SARS-COV-2, que detecte synthetic fragments SARS-COV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copy per microliter of input), usando un dipstick in menor than un hour san needed elaborate instrumentation.
81 Hope, la nova teknik kapav gera dramaticamente demonstrar la sensibility and convenience, if verified in clinic sampons.
} Pur absolution of experience with the roman CoV, doctors can principalmente support care a patients COVID-19, mens tentativas diverse terapiyas que existes usates or proponed before for tract of thetherapies of thetheraps, something SARS-COV and MERS-COV and MERS-COV and andere virus maladies (Tablel2).
81 Disse terapijas includes current and potencial tracts with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recuperate patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Lerth plasma from recovered patients proponeded a usarse for tract.
81 Farmaceutical company frece for develop anticorpos and vaccins contra the virus.
[1] SARS-COV-2, principalmente atake pulmons in start and probably also attaks, in minore grade, in andere organe que expres ACE2, como gastrointestinal system and ners.
Tačiau, disfunction respiratorial and fall is the store threads for the patients and the principal cause of death.
[1] Decision, respiratorial support is crucial for living the symptoms and salve animations and including general oxygen terapiya, oxygen high-flow, ventilation non ininvasive, and invasive mechanic ventilation invasive ventilation absolution on severity of the sakit.
81 Pacientes med severos symptomas respiratorial respirators deve supportar per extracorporeal membranation oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonal bipass technik usat for tract of cardiace of respirator insuffice.
81 Desde, manteniment of electrolyte balance, prevention and tratament of sekundar infection and septic shock, et protection of the essential organs, protection of the essential organs, is essencial for pacientes SARS-COV-2.
81 View knows that a citokin storm rezultata af affect on reageration of the immun system in SARS and MERS patients.
81 Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflamator respons, disponible per la liberation of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
81 These cytokines induce immun cells for rom a multiple radicals of free radicals, qui's the grand cause of ARDS and multiple organ fall.
1 Immunosuppression is essential in tract of torments cytokin, specialmente in graves patients.
== Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, un anti-IL6 monoclonal anti anticorpo anti-Il6, exists used for tract the citokin storm.
81 Other immunosuppression tractments for cytokin storm include modulation of T cell-directed immun reaction; blocked of IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blanatumomab; supressor of cytokina signaling 4; and inhibitors HDAC.
81 Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were ampliamente usated in tratament de SARS, for reducer le severity of inflamator dangerous.
Pero, steroids at high doses no existeds for grave pulmon head in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
1Only, ill can cause grave negative effects, specialmente avascularis osteonecrosis, affected dramatic the prognose.
1 Today, recommendades de cortikosteroids at low-to-moderate dose courses courses de cortikosteroids, recommenda ser utilisades prudently for criticly sacred COVID-19 pacients.
81 Sandod to scribe, effektive terapiya antiviral no existe confirmada.
[1] Today, intravenosa administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, existed be effeccious in american patient with COVID-19.
81 Remdesivir is un roman antiviral drog, developped by Gilead, inicialmente, for tract of maladies provocates by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
1 Lateral, remdesivir demonstrava imposible inhibition of andere single strended RNA virus, inclusive MERS and SARS virus.
81 Base on this, Gilead has proveed the compond to China to conduce un par de probas on SARS-COV-2- infected individus, et resultat estimalmente espera.
81 Adequated, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirina, æupotencial terapijas para patients with akut respirator symptoms.
81 Diarrhea, nause, vemitation, header daño, and andere reaktions negatives can out heavy post combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
81 Animation of this tracts with alter drugs uses in the patients, solution the interaction of this tracts with alter drugs.
Plasma de pacientes recuperated and generation anticorpose
81 La collection of the sang of the patients, qui recuperated of a contagieed maladi for tract of andere patients something of the same malad of protection of salutes persons from a capting the male, has long history.
81 Paciente recuperation ofte has relativ high niveau de anticorpos contra the patogen in their sang.
81 Antibodies es un immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B limfocytes for combats patogens and andere ancians objects, if recognize unic moleculas in the patogenes and neutralize them direct.
81 Base sur this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients, ktere recuperat av COVID-19, which injictificed in 10 paciente gravemente sajne.
81 In 24 hours, accompagned by reduced inflammation and viral charges and better oxygen saturation in the sang.
[1] Today, necessari ser verification and clarification for proposing the method for groundscale usage, before specific terapies no simpliced.
Partner negatif associate de plasma, purgue considere attentionalmente.
81 Per exemplo, anticorpos can overstimulate the immun reaction and cause cytokin release syndrome, qui potencial is a toxicity of life threating.
81 Concentration of anticorpos in the blood in the blood is normally back, and the plasma demanda is grande for tract the criticly sared patients.
81 Éta difficile development and produce specific anticorpos cast rapid to luchar contra una epidemie globale.
[1] Decir, isolate B cells de patients recuperated and identification the genetic codes code coding effect anticorpos or screen for effect anticorpos contra effects proteins of the virus.
81 Din cessari, nos gali facilmente scale la production of the anticorpos.
81 TSM exists used for tracting diverse maladi in China dura miles years.
[1] Today, effects is presently depend on a combination of multiple components in a formula que varia, dependend on diagnose of a maladi based on theory of CCM.
{1} Maxima de effektive components reserves unknown or is vag, from is difficulty extract and verificar tal components of their optimal combinations.
© Currently, tungod kay manke a effected and specific terapian for COVID-19, TSM has best un of the principale alternative traition for patients with light to moderate symptoms of associated of associate de graves etades.
== Por exemplo, Shu Feng Jie Du kapsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen kapsules futures effected for COVID-19.
81 Paciente COVID-19 patients COVID-19 COVID gradients exists observated in diverse provincias in China que uses TCM in 87% of their patients, inklusive Gansu (63,7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), mens Hubei province, izay used TCM in aparture 30% of the COVID-19 pacients, has the minimale guate rate (13%).
● Today, evaluation rebbeng inklude de norme de patients inklude de nominalitas, sot differents effects, soft to news of the center and severity of the patients.
[1] 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colaborators publiced un studio to compare western medicine (WM) sole tract with combined tract of WM and TCM.
81 De visite que time necessaire for recovery temperature, symptoms disparsing, and hospitalization in the WM+TCM group in the WM+TCM group were really short than in the only WM group.
81 Last impressionantly, le rate for symptomatic deterioration (from light to sever) for the WM+TCM group was extremely inferior for the WM+TCM group than for the WM unique group (7,4% contra 46,2%), a mortalidad was inferior in the WM+TCM group than WM uniquement group (8,8% contra 39%).
[1] Today, efficacity and security of CCM still wante de tests better controled at grands scales and in more centres.
81 Best interessant a caracterizar le mekanizmo de actions and clarification the effect components of CCM tractments or our combinations, if possible.
81 Paciente, existant suspecte o confirmado COVID-19, principalmente, exploitant grand time of the high contagie and even fatal disease, en carantinee, personas something, soleth, and error.
Alternativ, infection of the infection, som fever, hypoxia, and house, associate negative effects of the tracts, som insomnia provocats by corticosteroids, can done to more ansianse and mental difficulty.
{1} In la prima fase de la SARS, rapportaron vários psychiatric morbiteties, inklusive depresion persistente, angustia, atake panik, emocion psichomotor, psichotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidity.
81 Tracking and carantine, como part of the public health reacts to the browking COVID-19, kapav fabricando persones plus inquieting and kulpable about effects of the contagion, carantine, and stigma on their family and friends.
81. Decisiones de la COVID-19, suspecte individuals, persons and persons in contact with them, and the general public qui are need.
81 Psychological support should includ the creation of multidisciplinary mental health ekips, clear komunikations with regular and precis updates about the exporsion and tract plans SARS-COV-2, association of professional electronic displays and applications for evitar sock contact with junts.
81 Vaccinas effektivas existants for interruption the chade of transmission of animal reservators and infected humans to accessible hosts and ofte complementar a antiviral traitement in control of epidemies provocades by emergenty virus.
81 Have esforse for development vaccins sur S protein based for generation longterm and potential neutralisation anticorpos and/o protect immunity contra SARS-COV.
81 Vaccines live-attentuated have evaluated in animal models for SARS.
* Today, in vivo effect of this vaccin candidates in vivo in elders persons and leath-challenge models and their protection contra infection of zoonotic virus infection has infective ancora determinat precedente a studio clinic.
{1}This is probably for that SARS mort under 17 years previous, aber desde new case happen reported.
81 In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continua heading in Middle East, spreading to andere regions, سبب persistence de zoonotic sources in endemic regions.
81 Inactivate virus, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticulas, particulas like virus, particulas et subunits de protein rekombinant, used inactivated virus, DNA plasmids.
81 Development of a safe and efficace vaccin contra SARS-COV-2 for non-immunal individus, is urgente and critical task for control the current epidemie.
1) Todavia, problem probable supervisar le difficultate, سبب long period of time (18 months), necessari for development vaccine and the dynamic variation of CoVs.
81 COVID-19, COVID-19, some roman maladies, just started a demonstrar su complete clinical cursus per miles de patients.
1 Multiple case, patients can recuperar progressive gradiently with sequellae.
1 Today, something to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with high morbity and mortality in patients with graves cases.
81. Decision, prognose model for the male is essential for agencys de salude-care-priority of their services, specially in resources contrained.
1) Base sur studies cliniques reported for now, nowledledge factors can affect of association with the prognose of COVID-19 patients (Tabella 33):
1 Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognose of SARS, somely is very for COVID-19.
== COVID- 19 =======================================================================================================
81 Paciente qui necessited intensiv cuiration intensive cuidation were more probably have substance comorbidities and complications and were importantly older than associate through the news (ad mediane of 66 and 51 year), suggest age as prognostic factor for resultats of pacients COVID-19.
81 Sex: SARS-COV-2 ha infecteerd plus de mulheres roms (0,31/100 000 contra 0,27/100000), conforme decripcionat superior.
81 Comorbidities and complications: Pacientes with COVID-19 who need intensive cuiration is more probably sufrir av avance agute cardiaque heavy and arrhythmia.
81 Cardiac events was the principal reason for death in pacients SARS.
81 Happen reported, SARS-COV-2 can link to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to leper disfunctions in pacients COVID-19.
81 valevalemente, at elders and substance disease strengly correlation and can influence the junts.
81 Abnormal laboratorium conclusions: Level C-reactive protein (CRP) in sangu reflect level de inflamation or tiss daño de severity of inflamation of severity of inflamation and is propone to be potential prognostic factor for sakit, respons to therapy and ultima recovery.
81 La correlation of CRP niveau to the severity and prognose of COVID-19 has project.
1) Desde plus, elevate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK), võis também helpes providence the resultate.
81 Desse enzym's expresses extensive in multiple organes, specially in heart and league, and you libred under tiss daño.
{2}}After, attribute tradicionale markers for heart or leper disfunctions.
81 Major simptoms kliniques: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinic simptoms bizin considere account with the andere questions for prediction of resultats and complications of COVID-19.
{Use of steroids: Soo described toward, steroids is immunosuppressant usually usat as adjunctive terapie for infections maladies for reduction the severity of inflamator daño.
{1} Dose de corticosteroids long dose were amplicely usated in serve SARS patients, multi survivents sufrit de osteonecrosis avascularis osteonécrosis avec invalidez de life-long and poor quality of life.
[1] Solution, if necessari, steroids should use about dose and for short time in pacients COVID-19.
81 Stress mental: Sono decribed october, durante COVID-19 frapped, multi patients sufrir de extraordinarium stress long periode de carantine, extrema incertitude, long periode de carentina, de periode de extrema incertitude, de manifestar de mort de socio family membros and cother patients.
81 Illoède necessaire download psychological conseilings and longterm support for help these patients recovery from the stress and return to normal life.
[1] Segun studys demográfics, COVID-19 figure de COVID-19 existing have different epidemiological functions of SARS.
Plus de replication in the under respirator tract, SARS-COV-2 povas effectly replicar in the superior tract respirator and cause left or no symptoms in the earth fase of infection, something to andere CoVs que causa common freds.
81. Dafectuate patients infected on the time fase or incubation periode infected can produced a quantity of virus in quotidian activity, provocant beautiful for control of the epidemie.
♪ Today, le transmission of SARS-COV ti foi considerat to something to the transmission of the SARS-COV timeo timeo timeo timeous, ach la majoritatea transmission no happened in the initiative fase.
[1] Decidez, COVID-19's current exporsion is much more sever and difficile control than SARS.
81 Grande sforce momental in China in China, include la lockdown of Wuhan and city round and continue carantine of case total the population, in hopes de interruption the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
81 Elkepte这些 actions dramaticamente blessing the economy and the andere sectors of the pays, men number of new patients diminues, indikando lancement of the epidemie.
81 The most optimistic estimation is that the fraunce empty in March and the downwing fase every 3-4 months.
( 1 :⁠ 3) Today, certain andere experts non estimales.
81 Paul Hunter, et al., estimated que COVID-19, som parlees bastante plus infecsive than SARS, never finale in 2020.
== Ira Longini, et al., staled un model for prediction the epidemie resultate of the epidemie, and suggested SARS-COV-2 potent infecterer 2-treters of the global population.
81 Un canadian group reporte que SARS-COV-2 fue detected in midd-turbinate and gorgele swabs of patients, ktere recuperate and leave the hospital 2 weeks anteriors, qui indique que le novo identifiquée virus potentiel a episode cilical similar a influenza.

81 Ebola original foi prediciesset to cause tot un million case with half million de morts.
♪ Today, per streng carantine and isolation, le sakit finalmente existing under control.
{1} Posible, similar a SARS-COV, que SARS-COV-2 potest vinn negatif in infectivity, eventualmente mort down, or events un ménos patogen virus co-existing with humans.
81 Epidemia de COVID-19 avec SARS and MERS (Fig. (Fig.55).
= SARS-COV-2 ===SARS-COV-2 ===========================================================================================
81 The virus existed also in feces, which stude una new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
81 Un recent studio sur 138 case reporte que 41% de la case probablement provokade per infections nosocomicals, inclusive 17 patients with andere previous maladies and 40 providers of salude-care.
81. Decir, debe ser usat grande precaution for protection of humans, especialmente providers-saludary-care, social-workers, family members, colegues, etc. apartment infected in contact with pacients or infected persons.
81 La primera line of defense of the defense som potest usar for reduce the risk of infection is per vestir maskes face; både l'ussing of chirurgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) help control the breading of virus.
81 Maske kirurgical face maskes preventi liquid droplets from a potencial infected individu a travers trans the air or attenting on surfaces of materials, where potentiel infected output liquid droplets, from un potencial infected person, away transit transited via air of the air, of stick on surface of materials, where potential translate theothers to others.
[1] Today, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect contra inhalation of virions as minight as 10 to 80 nm, with just 5% of the virions were capable intrent complete; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size and before are ca. 85 nm.
Providers de salud-care in direct contact with patients muss vesti N95 (series # 1860s) masques N95 (series # 1860s) masques, maar no kirurgical masks.
17; plus a maskes, providers de salud-care-build should vesties apparates gowns isolated, for mus modified contact with virus.
81 Viruse can infected a individu per ohli.
81.22. january 2020, un doctor infected av SARS-CoV-2, hâlta his vesede en N95 mask; the virus potentielmente haber introduzit in su corona per su inflamator okays.

811 Before la prima isolation of HCoV-229E stamme B814 from the nasal descarding of nasal of patients which have contracted common fround, different CoVs has isoled in different animal infected, inklusive kalkuno, mus, boc, suck, cat and cid.
1 In ultime dekada, 7 HCoVs æe identificéiert.
81 Un short summa of the history of descovered of HCoV in chronology order (Tabel 1) were informative and instruction.
81 The first HCoV-229E stam was isoled from the respirator tract of patients with superior tract respirator infection in the ultra tract infection in 1966, and long the viewing to grow in WI-38 cell lines de pulmon lines.
81 Paciente infectuated with HCoV-229E presentate common fred symptoms, inklusive head, sneesing, malaise and hurry-peel-peel, con feever and house wated in 10~20% cases.
1 Lateralment, 1967, HCoV-OC43 buvo isolated av organ cultura, et simultane serial passage in cereals of suiter muis.
81 L'infection de HCoV-OC43 似乎 similar aqueque provocate by HCoV-229E, let's simptomaticly indistingable from infection with alter tract respirator patogens, som influenza A viruss and rhinovirus.
= HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 disparues globalement, and they tendence to transmissed prevalently in the seon of winter in mother klima.
1 Generalmente, incubation time of this two virus is menor than 1 week, follow of a circuit 2 week malas.
{1} Segun un volontaire studio humano, saludades infectives av HCoV-229E developped left common fred.
1 Tampoco beautiful pacientes immunocompromised manifestaron grave infection inferior tract respirator.
== SARS, denominat also como "atypisk pneumonia", was the first well documented HCoV-caused pandemie in historia humana, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the terced HCoV descopert.
{1} The first case of SARS potest ser traced back to final 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
81 Epidemia SARS resulted en 8,096, rapporte de cases med 774 deaths, plyst transversation in multe pays and continents.
== Excepto de super-spreaders, estimatiuwyd que kada case potentiel aproximativ 2 sekundral case, con periode de incubation de 4-7 days and the maximum of virus carding appeared on the 10 day of maladie.
81 Paciente infectuate con SARS-COV initial present with myalgia, head head, fever, malaise and chills, follow by dispnea, house and respirator angusting as later symptoms.
= Lymphopenia, deranged leper function tests, and excellent creatin kinase is common laboratorial anormalures of SARS.
==Diffuse alveolar daño, proliferation epithelial cells and increment of makrophages (SARS).
81 cam 20-30% de patients something necessited intensive care and mechanical ventillation.
81 Use a tract respirator inferior, multiple organes inklusive gastrointestinal tract, leper and nerus can infected also infect in this sever cases, normalmente accompagned by a cytokine storm, which can be mortally particularly in imunocompromised patients.
81 The virus was isoled first from the open pulmon biopsy of a relative of the index patient, which traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
{1}Stad atmosfere sforce existed dedicated to HCoV research.
81 HCoV-NL63 was isoled from un 7-monat-elder child from Netherlands durante lancement 2004.
81 Prz.B.C.E.V.V.V.A.B.C.V.V.
81 Presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the maladi provocate by HCoV-NL63.
81 Otro independente studio deskribió demonstrar la isolation of the same virus from un exemplar nasal from un 8 month boy, something of pneumonia in Netherlands.
81 Elkepte alia era identifikata in Netherlands, toda association verticalment districted global.
= Estimated, HCoV-NL63 accounts for ca. 4,7% of common respirator maladies, and the maximum incidence heighted in time somer, primavera and winter.
81 HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringite, also conected as croup.
71 anys, HCoV-HKU1 era isoled from un 71 anys, which had hospitaled with pneumonie and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
== Pneumonia accoquired communautaire and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 ================================================================================
== Similar a HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 existed globalement, provocant respirator maladies leve.
{1} All these 4 community-acquired HCoVs-acquired existes bien adapted to humans and generally mas probably mutate to causar high patogentic matters, embargo accidents existes pro uncore rare case of a plus virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, que recently happened have reported to causar sever tract infection inferior respirator tract in China.
81.Generalment, når ich HCoVs access the capacity for transmit effected and continually selfs in humans, if out of patogen or patogen.
== MERS- CoV =======================================================================================================
81. Welcome la majoritatea of the laboratorium-confirmated cases original de Middle East, cases imported with ocasional breading to close contacts happen reported in differents lands European and Tunise.
186 case confirmade de 186 case existivo in South Korea.
81 Clinical manifestations of MERS like de SARS, característicat by progressive pneumonia akuta.
[1] About SARS, multe patients with MERS insuffice abute nerenes, som hunzir lock unik for MERS inter HCoV-caused-medicals.
81 plus de 30% de patients presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, som diarrea and vemitation.
== Al februar 14, 2020, plus de 2500 laboratorium confirmat cases presented with a alta case fatality of 34,4%, fallity of MERS-CoV un of the mest devast virus knowed for humans.
== Durante medium tot la fin december 2019, centers of pneumonia patients retrospektively knowed to associated with SARS-COV-2 infection absolutioned in Wuhan, Province Hubei, China.
81 World Health Organization declarada que declaration continuing of infection inferior tract respirator provocate by SARS-COV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International International Preocup and the names the COVID-19.
© March 3, 2020, 90,053 case world-world, confirmanz un brut case fatality of 3,4%.
Probablement, le case fatality in Hubei, China is 4.2%, men long other of it is 1,2%.
[1] SARS-COV-2 causa severa infection respiratorial, like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, presentat as fever, tosh and dispnea.
1 Diarrhea visible also in certain patients.
81 Pneumonia is un of the mest sever symptoms and can progress rapid to akut respirator breve syndrome.
[1] Vìkeru SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 existes very similar a causa de high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, street in different branchs in the phylogenetic árbore.
= SARS-COV-2 ==SARS-CoV-2 ====SARS-COV-2 =============================================================
==Assimptomatische subjects infected with SARS-COV-2 habe sertified and can contributing to rapid to the world.
81 Comparation and contrast SARS-COV-2 with the andere six HCoVs revelar similarments and differences of stor interess.
1.1 First, periode de incubation and duration of curs of HCoV disease is very similar.
81. About, SARS-COV-2 fluxer length general tendence of the andere 6 HCoVs.
§ II, le severity of COVID-19 like between SARS-COV and the 4 community-acquired HCoV (t.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
81 Apartment, SARS-COV-2 infection exposs característiques que existes more visualities durante infection con infection community-acquired HCoVs, inclusive presentation of non specific, left or even no simptoms.
́An apartment, a small subsum of graves cases of COVID-19, eventuals visibility of CORS-COV infection, però la proportion is a bit inferior.
17; True, transmission of SARS-COV-2 demonstrant arī interessant patrones característica de både communautaire-acquired HCoVs and SARS-COV.
== About, transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 ===========================================================================================
81 Apartment, continua a verificar obe transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 reduce post passages in humans, como in cases SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
© Finally, same as the alter HCoVs, SARS-COV-2 kapav detectar in sampones fecal.
81 Of transmission fecal-oral of SARS-COV-2 play un important rol, so som in case SARS-COV, almenys under certain circumstance, continua a clarificar per future studies.
==Es particularmente interessant, probablemente, SARS-COV-2 potest exposition sesoanity as in cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
81. Today, le característiko SARS-COV-2, inclusive su transmissibility, patogenity and sustainable breakfast post passages in humans, were influency on the ultime destin of the current startup of COVID-19.
1 All 4 community-acquired HCoVs provocant leve symptoms, existsly adapted to humans.
81 A partir de nodre perspektive, eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh, ke humane habei adapted bien a desse 4 HCoVs.
81 Anders words, bombia potentielmente before de la pandemia antike HCoV.
81 HCoVs que causan severa maladies in humans and humans, qui developped severa HCoV disease, ændres.
{1} For to so, HCoVs bizin replikar in humans i suficiente grad for attachments of adaptive mutations que contrariver factors de restriction host.
{1} In this sens, long forward SARS-COV-2 persistí, long long perseverand's SARS-COV-2 broupses, oge long perseverant long outdoption to humans.
81 If it adapter goed, transmissions in humans behard difficile stop per carantine or andere mechanismen control infections.
81 Per molte 年лар, le quatre community-acquired CoV circulate in populations humans, producant common frood in immunokompetent subjects.
81 These virus none need a reserveure animal.
81 En contrast, SARS-COV et MERS-COV high patogenic no exists adapted to humans now and their transmission in the humans can canable support.
81 It need forward and propage in their zoonotic reservators and seek the chance for forsver to accessible human targets, possiblely via un other intermed and amplifiable hosts.
= SARS-COV-2 ha características somes similars a SARS-CoV/MERS-COV, as the 4 community-acquired HCoVs.
==It's how transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, almenys for the time.
1) Today, it is mehr patogen than HCoVs-acquired communautaire and menor patogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
81 Reserve to visible on on on only adapting complet to humans and circulate in humans without reservator or intermedium host animal.
} Before discutir le animal origines of HCoVs, burkina gut demonstrar nos de definitions and característiques of evolution, natural, reservator, intermedial and amplifing hosts of HCoVs.
== Un animal server como evolution host of an HCoV, if port a antefather someting high homology at niveau of nucleotide sequence.
81 Le virus de banderas normalmente tien adapted bien et non-patogenic in this host.
1 Tampoco, un reservator host ports HCoV continue and for longterm.
81 In due case, le hosts exists natural infected and is the natural hosts of HCoV or the parent virus.
81 En contrast, if HCoV's new introduced to un intermediant host right before of round its introduction to humans, it's not just adapted to the new host and ofte is patogen.
{1} This intermediant host can service as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of un amplifing host per permit the virus replicate transitionally and transmit it to humans amplify the skala of human infection.
81 A HCoV puede submeter a infection death-end, if e non supportar transmissions in intermedium host.
© Alternative, HCoV can also adapte to the intermed host, eventualmente establish endemicity a longterm.
81 In this case, l'intermedium host's word a natural reservator host.
81 Epidemiological data manifestamente retrospectively observa que le index case of SARS has contact history with game animals.
81 Investigations subsequent seroprevalence demonstras que negosiantes animals has a prevalens de anti-SARS-COV IgG, comparative with the general population.
==Paguma larvata ==Paguma larvata) and a racoon id in live animal marketes masked existed first identiced for card SARS-CoV-like viruss, like SARS-COV, qui gaiva identic a SARS-COV.
81. It was indirectly supported by the fact that nother SARS notificated after morte all civets in the markets.
81. No obstante, existes rapported that masked palm civets from the wild or fermers with exposation to the live animal markets was groundly negative for SARS-COV, suggeriment que palm civets can masked amplifiant use just como intermedium host, men non the natural reservator of SARS-COV.
81. Notificablement, eftersom 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou has anti-SARS-COV anti anti anticorpos, la possibilitates que multiple species of mamiferes of small matriums potentiels potentiels potentiels eventualmente servir como intermedia amplifiant hosts of SARS-COV.
{1}All these something's dead-end hosts of SARS-COV.
81 Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV a desvelar a lock related bat CoV, charn Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), wat existing in Chinese baths.
81 These bats is positive for anti-SARS-COV anticorpos and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
81 This and andere bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-COV.
81 Desse studies presentes fundamental for the new concepte que sports host emergency patogens human emergency patogens.
81 SARS-like CoVs (SL-COVs) æe identificati de bats, pero none excepte un WIV1 designated WIV1 puede ser isolated as live virus.
== Angiotensin converting enzym 2 (ACE2) = receptor de SARS-COV.
= WIV1 derivated from fecal sample of bats * * * * *****************************************************************************************
81 Intriguelly, sera of convalescent patients SARS potential neutralisation WIV1.
{1} Tampoco, WIV1 represente the mest context antefather of SARS-COV in bats, share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
81 Personellement, obtener la high homology between disease due virus, general se crede que WIV1 is not the immediat parent virus of SARS-COV and bats is not the immediate reservator host of SARS-COV.
1 Phylogenetic analyse clusters MERS-COV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
== Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-COV uses the same receptor host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
81 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV existes filogeneticly free to homologes in bat beta-CoVs identified of Europe and Africa.
Å3⁄4est now, no live MERS-COV puede trovar in wild bats.
== MERS-COV and the nearch relative bat CoV-HKU25 share just 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
81. Decidez, batts potentielmente aberbergo aberbergo.
́An apartment, studies in Middle East presents, que camelos dromedarios camelos sont seropozitives for MERS-CoV specific neutralisation anticorpos, same que camelos of Middle East origin in multiple African pays.
81 Live MERS-COV identic to the virus found in humans was isoled from the nasal swabs of cromedary camels, proporcionar que camelos servis como bona fide reservator host of MERS-COV.
81 Il est notevolle que general effect symptoms, men massive virus desageting, observades in camelos experimentally infected with MERS-COV.
*Notificable, camel infected camelos verse virus ne solamente per respirator route, men ook per fecal-oral route, that is the principal route for virus transfering from bats.
81. Today, now reserve questions since of many confirmate cases of MERS ha no contact history with camels previous onset, plausibly addicted to human transmission-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes, inklusive unconnected animal species species que portant MERS-COV.
= SARS-COV-2 share 96,2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolate from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
81 Like in cases SARS-COV and MERS-COV, le sequence divergence between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13, is tros grand for asignar parent relations.
{1} To dica, batts more not be the immediate reservator host(s) of SARS-COV-2, absolution case identity bat CoVs find in future.
© Presumablely, intermedial animal hosts of SARS-COV-2 should be parties of the animals specys of animals vended and morted at the Huanan Seafood Whollsale Market, which multi of the inicial cases of COVID-19 were asociated, indicative of a probable transmission event animal-to-human.
81 Diverse recente studies based on metagenomic sequencering has suggestioned a group of small mammiferes riesed, conected as pangolins (Manis javanica), potencipal beta-CoVs relative à SARS-COV-2.
81 The roman pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-COV-2.
81. Todavia, igual adequated liked to RaTG13 avec circuit 90% identity at niveau of nucleotide sequence.
́On glustere in 2 sublineages of SARS-COV-2-like virus in the phylogenetic árbore, un of which share a more similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) with SARS-COV-2, with 97,4% amino acid sequence identity.
81 In streng contrast, RBDs of SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 standard mehr divergent, aber a grad de sequence homology genome-white.
81 Un anterior studio sobre pangolins someble reporte detection of virus contigs from pulmon sampons, something is same like to SARS-COV-2.
81 Isto studio adopte differents methods de asambleament and manual curation for generar un parcial sequence genom, custom ca. 86,3% of the genom virus complet-longed.
81 We can in exclude the possibility that pangolin is un of the intermed animal hosts of SARS-COV-2.
[1] Todavia, actualmente, eventual no existe evidences for support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-COV-2 origine of SARS-COV-2, debido de sequence divergence entre SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-COV.
1 Partner, la distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is encore short than that between SARS-COV-2 and pangolin SARS-COV-2-related beta-CoV.
81 La evolutional path of SARS-COV-2 in bats, pangolins and andere mammiferes resistent destination.
== The maxime sequence homology is found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 share the maxime sequence homology of genome-wide.
== Excellent speculative que le alta grade de similiasion entre RBDs of pangolin SARS-COV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-COV-2 tiempless per selectivity convergent evolution.
81 A contra-proposal is favor of a recombination between a pangolin SARS-COV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the tercece animal species wild.
{1} Come a driver force in evolution, recombination inter beta-CoVs larged.
{1} The jury is still out of the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-COV-2.
== Exception of the high patogenic HCoVs, existing the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 study.
81 Phylogenetic evidence demonstrant que HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E potest have originat from bat CoVs, mens los parentes virus de HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 futures found in rooters.
{1} Has reported a bat CoV appelled ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat tricolored bat displayed close relation with HCoV-NL63.
81 Apartment, HCoV-229E was geneticamente related to ather bat CoV, charge Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, something were detected in Ghana, mens camelids existes suspected in the intermedi host.
81 For clarity, in Figura 1 and Table 2.
81 Phylogenetic analyse ha proveded for interpecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.
81 When HCoV-OC43 traversed species for infecter humans from domestic beauty case 1890, existing a pandemia of respirator infection.
81 The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is menos clear.
[1] Bat alpha-CoVs clock related to HCoV-229E have found.
==Anter elphaca alpha-COV ======================================
81 Diferents linies of evidence supporter directement transmission of virus from bats to humans.
117 Primer, humans, men non alpacas, võis habe contact with bats in a participed nich ekology.
▪ Ingen râ râ râ, humanes has sock contact with alpacas.
seconda, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-COVs diverse and non-patogenic in bats, mens alpaca alpha-COV provoca un fraude de respiratoris of respirator infected animals.
Alphaca alfa-COV finalizar, alphaca alfa-COV no existed in fental animals.
81. Decision, imposible exclusive la possibilitate que alpacas obtient the HCoV-229E related alpha-CoV from humans.
De facto, bats is the direct source of human patogen virus inklusive rabie virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
{1}Not's to surprized byts can transmit HCoV-229E to humans directement.
Alternative, mens bat alpha-CoV serve como gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedry camels canly serve as intermed hosts, qui transmiss virus to humans, exactly as in case MERS-COV.
== MERS-CoV serve como excellente exemplo of interspecies transmission from bats todromedry camels and from dromedry camels to humans.
81 La evolution of MERS-COV from bats nowledged on the initiative identification and the ulterior research have fortificated by successive conclusions.
== Ok, obviously, bats offre a rich pool of virus species for interspecies change of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
81 Longevity, dist packed kolonies, close social interaktion and fort ability for fly, alle conditions favorables for bats for been 'virus sprayer' is ideal.
81 Apartment, MERS-COV presented todromedry camels distance deceniors.
81 Ok, on only adapted to these camels, qui have tornat de un intermedium host, a un stable and natural reservator host.
== MERS-COV provoca very leve maladies and mantend a mutation rate relativamente bas mutation rate in these animals.
81 Sus sporadic transmission to humans is un accident and humans continue a death-end home of MERS-COV, from its transmission non sea substance.
§In contrast to role of camels in transmission of MERS-COV, rol de pangolins, if exist, in transmission of SARS-COV-2, different.
== Specially, pangolin beta-COVs sont how patogen in pangolins.
{1}_BAR__BAR__BAR___BAR___BAR___BAR___BAR___BAR____BAR___BAR___BAR___BAR___BAR___BAR___BAR_____BAR____BAR___BAR_
81 Diverse possibilitates for interspecies transmission of SARS-COV-2 from animals to humans, ohhhhh.
81 First, batts potest be the reservator host of a virus SARS-COV-2-relationed already identity to SARS-COV-2.
81 Adams potentielmente valuta le nich ekolojik per buchering or miner carbon.
81 II, pangolins potentielmente be uno de intermedia amplifiant host, which has not introduced un virus SARS-COV-2-related.
81 Adams contracts the virus per buchering and consum of game carness.
81. Let's possible, multa mamífera, inclusive animal domestic, existants de SARS-COV-2.
81 Derogadede un survey of domestic and wild animals for anticorpos.
{1} Terced, conforme mencionat october, recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2, potencil habe heured in un tercer species que has contact with bats and pangolins.
81 La search for animals origines of SARS-COV-2 still.
[1] Apart de diferents types of the animal hosts, 3 grandi factors on the virus side, in facilitation CoVs for transcear species barrieres, eventuals relevante.
81 First of all, in RNA replication their relativement high mutation rates.
81. In comparation with andere single-stranded RNA virus, le estimate mutation rates of CoVs potentiels consideres como "moderate" to "high" with a media substitution rate be ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depende on the fase of adaptation of CoV to roman hosts.
== CoVs has a prova-reading exoribonuclease, purification of the which result in exoribonuclease exaltable mutability, attenuation or even inviable.
81 Interessante, le nucleotide analog Remdesivir is knowed to supting CoV replication per inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase.
== Remdesivir is un of the mest promised anti-SARS-COV-2 agents que ser tests in klinical tests.
Today, mutation rates of CoVs exists ca. 1 million верs plus elevantes romper town of their hosts.
Mais desde, mutation rate ofte is high when CoV's not adapted to the host.
81 Comparation with SARS-COV with a high mutation rate, mutation rate of SARS-COV-2 absolut inferior, suggestive of a mayor niveau of adaptation to humans.
81 Aboutly, existed it always adapted to alternative host soft to humans.
© plus de SARS-COV-2, this is applicable to MERS-COV, which is feely adapted todromedry camels.
81 Theoreticly, impossible que genetic drift de drift vertical vaccins and antivirals contra SARS-COV-2 inefficace rapid.
§2, the grand RNA genome in CoVs exerce extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, probably augmenting the probability for interspecies co-evolution, care is avantage for openting of nowe CoVs when the conditions because appropriate.
81 This is supported by the policiaus unique open read frame and protein functions coded to the 3′ fin of the genome.
[1] Tercera, CoVs ready and frequent switch models durante RNA replication via un unique mechanism "copy-choice" mechanism.
81 In un host que serve como mix-base, trand transcription CoV RNA is ofte.
Highly homologous full-longth and subgenomic RNAS can recombine for generation new CoVs.
81 Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as animal CoVs, tal como bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
== Virus-host interaktion relative à transmission
1 plus de 3 virus faktors, interaktion viral with host receptor is a alternative factor influency on interspecies transmission.
Hierin, recombination of SARS-CoV tipic exemplu tipic, care manifestion of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
{1} Base sur la comparative analyse entre isolations of human and civet SARS-COVs, SARS-COV pensé que SARS-COV subfred adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
[1] Generalment, RBD in the S protein of a CoV interagir avec receptor cell receptor, et es intensiv selected by the host anticorpose response.
[1] In SARS-COV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, que bindings to the human ACE2 and the coreceptors for virus input.
81 The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable reconnace the ACE2 receptors of divers animals, including bat, civet, mus and raccoon id, permite interspecies transmission of the virus.
81 De facto, anke 6 amino acid rest residues existes diferents of human and civet virus isolates in RBD and 4 of there locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaktion with the ACE2 receptor.
== Civet SARS- CoV ha K479N and S487T mutations in su RBD, which can accessive the affinity of the interaction of spick protein with human receptor ACE2.
[1] De alternativamente, aceste dos amino acid substitution potest be kritic for adaption viral to humans.
81 Il est notitable que SARS-COV-2 participe le same receptor cellular with SARS-COV.
81 A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicate that the binding affinity of the S protein with human ACE2 potest have variat.
* En really, un study cryo-EM indiquen un affinity de 10-20 per 20 per software superior affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-COV S protein.
== Bis é interessant determinar to determinar, onda cesset to transmission SARS-COV-2.
81 Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 also bindings to ACE2, men con a different parte de S.
81 Existe multa alternative receptors HCoV, مثل aminoptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
81.On can account to success adaptation of this CoVs in humans post interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
[1] Plus a receptors cellulars, resultat de interspecies transmission of HCoVs is registred by andere host dependence and restriction factors.
81 La divergence of the host proteins between humans and natural reservator hosts of HCoVs, som bats, cromedary camels and roets, võis constitue un barrier for interspecies transmission.
81 HCoVs ຕ້ອງ usurpa factors dependence host dependence and subversation factors host restrictions for a success interspecies transmission.
[1] About this, determinants molecular determinants in this important area of interaction of virus-host continua a identification and caracterizate.
81 Un unbiased genome-whole screening of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-COV-2, usant the state-of-art-technology of CRISPR, eventualment account dependence and restrictions factors for SARS-COV-2.
81 Emergence of roman HCoVs: back to back zero
81 La diversity of bat CoVs offre amply opportunits for opentation of romans HCoVs.
{1}In this sens, bat CoVs serve como gene pool of HCoVs.
Please, rapid mutation and genetic recombination, evolution HCoV, evolution, eventualmente servir como 2 stappes importantes in this process.
== Por exemplo, adquisition or perda de nove gens proteincoding-coding ha possibility a modifier drastic phenotips virus.
81 Inter accessory proteins SARS-COV, ORF8 is pensé que ORF8 be important in adaptation to humans, tant viruss related bat, SARS-CoV related on SAV, futures isolated, men found to coding divergent protein ORF8 protein.
81 Una 29-nucleotide delease característica de SARS-COVs existes in stammes isoled at start of the human epidemie.
[1] This scheme divide ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, think is un adaptive mutation que promove la switch of hosts.
Partner, SARS-COV have a possible recombination history with lineations of alpha- and gamma-COVs, where existing a part of minor rekombinant regions in RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
81 Localities de recombination identifiqued also in nsp9, la mayoría de nsp10, and parties of nsp14.
== Similarmente, existís belli epidemie MERS-COV experienced recombination events between diferents ligness, which existed in cromedrary camels in Saudi Arabia.
[1] Desde SARS-COV and MERS-COV, existing recombination events also in andere HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with andere animal CoVs in their non-structural gens.
81 Well not attention the artificial selection can contribute to uninted changements in virus genomomes, probably resultat af relieve viruss from selection pressure exercited, talk by the host immun system.
81 Un exemplu desse effects is the perde of a complet-longring ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E, prototip, prototip, prototip, debido a 2-nucleotide eliminar.

81 Last, men men o menos, evolution of roman HCoVs, evolution of romans HCoVs, provocation only the selection press in their reservator hosts.

§ Appeatured that bats's find adapted to CoVs anatomical and physiologically.
Pro-inflamator respons pro- inflamator in bats diminuer effektivmente la pathologia produced by CoVs.
Please, la natural killer cell activity in bats activity is submited to upregulation of inhibitory receptor natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 et bas expression niveau of major histocompatibility complex class I moleculas.
Alternative species reative oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats of bats can both supting CoV replication and affect provareading by exoribonuclease, providering the selection pression for the generation of virus stances high patogenic for the generation of virus stammes high patogen, quando introduced in a nove host.

§On replikar robustly, sans effect a fort immun respons host.
Hier menties the secrets of the why existing assymptomatic transportators and what cause the grave cases in human infection.
81 The sever symptoms is principalmente a causa de hyperactivation of immun reaction and the citokin storm where le plus force the immun response, long plus sever the pulmon daño.
81 En contrast, in assimptomatische transporteurs, immun respons existed decouped from CoV replication.
81 La same strategia de delinking the immunity response can have beneficial effects in therapy anti-SARS-COV-2.
81 The interferon reage is particularly fort in bats.

81 Viewing continue in mammiferas is necessary for better understand of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, care probably útil for prevention of animals-to-human transmission and future broups.
81 For conclusion, le plus efficace mode to prevenir virus zoonosis is for humans away from the ecology nichs of the natural reservators of the zoonotic virus.
81 November parties in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-COV-2 still disparu.
81 First, if bats transmitter un ancian virus de SARS-COV-2 to pangolins, better interessant see under which situations bats and pangolins can share the same nich ekology.

81 ACE2 in tornal attacks the carboxyl-terminal amino acid fenilanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyl-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it in the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
81 ACE2 povas aparte vários andere peptides inklusive [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
= ACE2 regular også la membrana trafic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in Hartnup's disease.
81 Come a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serve como principale input point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus que causa SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus que causa COVID-19).
== Over specifiquement, le binding of the spick S1 protein of SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 to the enzymatic domein of ACE2 on the surface of cells resultat in endocytose and translocation of the virus and the enzyme in endosomes localizate in the cells.
{1} Input process require primeing of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of the host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of which is under current investigation como potential terapeutic.This have left some to hipothesize que reduce niveaus of ACE2, in cells, can help to lutting the infection.
* Today, multiple professional society and regulative organs ha recommend continue standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
81 Un systematic review and meta-analyse publiced on July 11 July 2012, observa que "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% risk of pneumonia comparated with controls".
