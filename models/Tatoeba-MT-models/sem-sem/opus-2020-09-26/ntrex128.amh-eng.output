The Walsh M.M. has been afraid of being like "shaping"
Some MEMs were concerned that their call must be to the Embullips (members of Walsh Parliament).
The case was due to the plan to change the name of the company to Walsh Parlama.
Ems in the political world are concerned that it can bring ridicule.
One Libert E.M. said he was afraid that his team would be in contact with "Tiebullipi and Pepeblyopy".
For our readers outside Welsh, it's a fool at Walsh Tidbullipe, and it's a pibblewop.
According to one Plide M.M., the group as a whole "not happy" and pointed to options.
According to the Walsh actress, their team has a "reputational mind" about their name change, but it is a short word frequencies from the MPBlI to the MPEt.
In this cord, the Walsh letter is similar to what the Walsh letter reads in Yorkshire in English.
According to the Commission of the Hospital Commission, which is now in the process of introducing similar changes, “any explanations of what the members of the Hospital are called are really their own members. ”
The Wales Constitution of 2017 granted the Walsh Council the authority to change his name.
In June, the Programme, which was designed to call the Council Walsh Parliament, published the public advice that was widely supported.
On the issue of the EM, the Commission has chosen the Walsh Parliament or Wales, but the alternative Embblewopy has been supported by public advice.
EMIs are offering clear alternatives, but they can be self-imposed for the current sponsorship of a change in the weeks, which is expected to bring about the agreement of Ellen Jones.
The revisions include laws and the Commission's system on the removal of EMPs, including changes in the way the reforming council is working.
When the MEMs argue about the matter, they get the final voice in the question of who they should be called.
The Macedonians chose to change their country’s name when refurbishing
Sunday choicers choose to call their country the name of the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The public choice was to resolve the disagreement that had been with the neighboring country of Greece for ten years, whose territory is called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has opposed her request to become a member of Yu and Neto, claiming that the name of her northern neighbor is a question in her territory.
The President George Evanov of Macedonia, who opposes the choice of name change, has shown that he does not pay attention to the choice.
However, the prime minister, including Zoran Zayev, asserts that the reefrandom supporters are easily paid to become members of Yu and Neto.
During the struggle of the Churches in Harlem, Saint Martin’s bells were quiet
Mr. Adam said: "The leaders I spoke to in history were a brown and a church at every corner."
"No one today."
They have stated that the destruction of brown beans is obvious.
Today, "people do social relations in a different way," he said.
"Bannabys are no longer regular homes in the local living room."
The money from selling property to the churches was threatened, as the leaders thought, that it would be very unlikely, "and they are at a place where they started to be quickly delayed."
In addition, as the churches have pointed out, they can be replaced by the rest of the local temples, which are filled with adjacent buildings, where people do not understand the rest of the local temples.
“It's not expected that many people who buy common homes in this area will be white, ” he said, “and that's why the day these churches will be shut down from their bodies because most people who come to these common homes are not expected to be members of these churches. ”
Both churches, Harlem, was predetermined as a black monument in white convoys, built in 1870 by St. Martin ten years later.
The major white Methodist council was released in the 1930 ’ s.
Recently, the Black House held a building ownership.
St. Martin was led by Castle John Howard Johnson, by the assassination of 125th Street merchants on Harlem’s main shopping street, where he had endured the black breeding or growing.
The fire building in 1939 was severely damaged, but when Pastor Johnson planned to rebuilt the ladies, he had built a musical instrument.
The priest David Johnson, the son of Pastor Johnson, and his successor, St. Martin, called his proud musical instrument "Poverty Calls. "
The professionals who played the musical instrument in July have called it something else: "The cultural wealth" and "the historical instrument."
In addition, 18 years ago, her expert at Michigan University, Tiffany Engie, was the first musical instrument in the world to be used by the black musician, the dioncio A.L.L.
According to Mr. Marywzer, St. Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, some of the church leaders and others of the country’s preaching activity have been a complex story of Arctics and Contratractors.
Although the House-Church leaders were not involved in the process of hiring the architects and contractors sent by the house, the public order in July wrote: "He wants to spend his expenses on the property."
Some of the laity complain that there is a problem of privacy in the country's preaching.
Asa, a 13 - year - old boy who was swimming to capture Lobster in California, suffered permanent damage
On Saturday, in Kafornia, the authorities reported that he was injured by a 13-year-old son who was swimming to catch a permanent lobster during Lubster.
The damage occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near the coast of Encinitas on the coast of Becken.
Chad Hamil Sandiago explained to the KSWB-TV on Saturday morning, they were talking with their friends for half an hour.
Hamel initially thought it was a pleasure to hold Lobster, but they said that they were saying that he was crying, "I was touched!"
'I'm touched!'
The whole farm is open, and Emily says that they immediately came to realize it.
"I've said aloud to all people to get out of the water," said Hammel.
The child was sent to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he had entered the danger list.
The deadliest species of Asa has not been identified.
A few weeks ago, as Cathen Larry Gills said in the media's statement, Asa was seen on the scene, but it was taken not to be a dangerous, permanent species.
As Guils added, the victim suffered horrific damage to the upper body.
Officials have closed the coast for 48 hours, from the coast of the Ponto coast to Swamis, Kazablad.
According to Gils, there are more than 135 species of Asa, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
CENSBERY’S PLANNES TO THE YUKE’S WITNESSES
With the help of the professionals in Censbrey's workforce, there are buffets, superdragues and Debense’s large stores of beauty, which are organized in various parts.
As fashion and domestic sales are declining, the £2.8 billion force body, the largest yards of beauty, will be tested in the 11 outskirts of the country, if successful the following year.
The supermarkets of the beauty have come once to save TVs, heaters and households.
According to Censbrey, Essy, Twiserman, and Dr. Brands, including Ravlon, Essy, and Twiserman, have doubled their beauty by bringing them up to 3 000 products.
From Claurel, Maibellene and Burts Bess, the products that are now being produced will have a lot better place in Brand, similar to those found in shops such as Buzz.
The supermarket also re-initiates the amount of the Boutkuk Mekap to make only garden farmers the most demanded of young customers.
In addition, the Stokes market of François has been attempting to cut down both censberry shops, the first week of which was opened to South London Croidone, and the second at Berminingham, Seley Oak, at the end of this year.
Online's sale and the smallest foods every day are suitable for buying, which means that the supermarkets need to be better able to get people to visit.
According to the Chief Manager of Sensberry, Mike Cuppe, is a large, multi-dimensional market for sales, as well as for Aldy and Lydell, who have more services and services than food-free products.
Censberry placed the argon’s exits in hundreds of stores, and introduced the two chains two years ago, which strengthened the sale of groceries and made their possessions more profitable.
The supermarket's earlier attempt to renovate beauty and medicine houses has been unsuccessful.
In the early 2000 ’ s, Censbrey attempted to start with Bots, but the disagreement on how to divide the income from the sopermarks' stores has ended.
The new strategy came after the 281-Cambrey drug sold the house three years ago to Selecio, the owner of the Lloyd drug chain, for £125 million.
According to Lloyd Laroshe-Posi and Vinci also play a role in the plan by adding luxurious skin care to the Brands in four large stores.
According to the Director of Commerce of Senegal, Paul Mils-Hooks, "We have changed our beauty and feeling to our clients to raise the environment.
We have also invested in specially trained and counselling partners.
Brand's kinds are prepared for each interest, and the locality of the sworn sworn and the convenient locations, that is, we are now a persuasive, compelling architectural architecture.
£11 million after going out of Holly's Wildlife, Peter Jones was so angry.
Peter Johns of Dragnes Dun's star focused on the new subcontracts with Marx and Spencer and Itevy, which had agreed with the life business of Brand.
Wilogby has no time for them to have household goods and shifts.
The business of the ancients was linked to the Guénez Paltrau Gup Brand.
Instagram announced that the 37-year-old woman of Zis Morning was going out.
To focus on the new subcontracts that she had made with Marx and Spain and Itavie, Holly Wilogby was furious at Dragnes Dean Peter Johns, who finally left the caravan’s business.
According to sources, at a stressful meeting at Marlowe, Bakinghamshire, the headquarters of the Commercial Department, the golden TVman said that her new cuisine would go up to £1.5 million and that she would no longer use Brand Trully’s households and exchanges for them.
The business was connected with the Gwenez Paltrou Prand, and it showed that Wilogbin had doubled its wealth by £11 million.
When 37-year-old Wilogby announced that she would leave in Instagram Trullin, Jones went from Britain to one of the restrooms in Jet.
According to one source, "Trullie Holly was one of the main priorities.
For the next ten years, it was a long future work.
The decision to leave shocked all the participants in the matter.
No one could believe it on Tuesday, and it was too soon to start.
The storehouse in the capital office in Marlo is filled with goods ready for sale.
Tomorrow morning's visitor is one of the most prominent banking experts in Britain, who have expressed their conviction that the release of this man would cost millions of dollars to the company that produces dirt and shining clothes and would lead to a delay in the next successful trip.
As a result, a long-term partnership can end.
Willogie, the mother of the children of the South, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are close to John and his wife, Terah Cap.
In 2016, Wylogie strengthened her relationship with Cap more closely, and 52-year-old John was president of the month Marsh.
The CAPLS Hollyday Tugazer and Jones have 40 percent of their share of the Bald Win TV Program.
Willogie is to be an ambassador to the M.S.B.A., thus replacing Ant Mac Partlin, an I.T.V.I.A.S. Serbry.
Closest sources to Johns said last night "they don't want to make comments about him."
Interestingly, after a conversation, we both fell in love.
In some cases, he was molded by an "unpredictable president" remarks and by the criticism of news media, thinking of something positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why the President Trump?
"This is the voice of the new news reader."
"I don't give up on anything."
As he explained, when Kim was happy at the second meeting, this meeting was the best way to conduct the North Korea, Nicolare Alba, which was first held in June in Singapore and was hosted by Trump.
However, Nicoler's agreement stands out.
Ri Gle Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, spoke with various world leaders in the United States, three months after the June month of Singapore meeting. The whole group did not focus on the "competent response" that the North Americans had given to North Korea.
According to him, America has continued to harass us with a view to creating an influence on us.
Trump's long talk made good news.
He said that we are working well with North Korea.
With North Korea, we had been leading to war before.
Millions could have been destroyed.
We have now been able to establish good relationships.
As he says, the efforts to improve their relationship with Kim have brought positive results, which will include robots,
They disagreed when they were asked to create a relationship with Kim.
Trump said that it would be easier to be president than to bring 10 thousand people to a full-school hall, and they pointed out to the people in front of them that there are now about 200 people at the hall.
Hundreds of people died from the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia.
Loom Bok had been shown not to be in need of help from non-governmental organizations outside countries following the earthquake.
Although about 10% of Lom Boke's population has been disembarked, no national threat has been reported.
According to Mr. Sambong, "in many instances there is no request for international assistance, and this is very difficult."
When Seve The Children was preparing a travel group to Palo, it was not certain that foreign professionals could enter the place and succeed.
According to national disaster spokesman M/Shotopo, Indonesian authorities were making an announcement that there was a chance for the international agency to enter the place.
Just as Indonesia faces a number of times, so this earthquake has become unpleasant.
Although the Tsunami in Hech has followed the tsunami, there are few other shores.
Although there was no call in Palo for the tsunami warning, it played a major role in people's death, even though it did not produce much.
It was not even easy to move from one island to another in Indonesia when it was safe.
Natural disaster is more concerned with Logistics.
The ship at the Bok Hospital is traveling to help the victims in the Palo, but it takes at least 3 days to reach the Palo.
President Jacko Widodo promised to improve Indonesia's development at the time of the election movement, thus spending a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But lesser individuals have been threatened by the Mi/Jacon Administration in the next year's choice.
Mi/Joko is also under pressure, and more Muslims are becoming adhering to the traditions.
In the street battles of the Christian and Muslim bands, more than 1 thousand were killed, and 10 percent were removed from the horizon, and the rifles were used for the battle, such as arrows, bows, and other instruments.

Cromwell has become a good memory of the history of the parliamentary stadium.
A number of British traditional and religious gifts, which the Taliban have loved and given to the Persia, are just what is expected to happen.
The Chrom Weal community portrays Mi/R Chryck as a silk and a history rehearsal.
According to John Gold Smith, a Crowm Welder community, the present argument is not about raising the image of the Oliver Compuel that stands outside the West Minster palace.
Many would not accept the British civil war, which was not a crowmwell, nor was it a cult.
Crom Whale's weakness is to pay for Thomas' predecessor's duties.
The way Sar William Ham describes Cromwell illustrates the 19th century's mathematical evidence and its history, which has still made many respectful.
Mi/Gold Smith speaks to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was honored in barquets, especially in the 19th century, was more respected than ever, and was faced with outside pressures in Parliament, especially from the royal family.
The fact that the issue is a historical dispute continues to be the case in full.
Of course, the conflict in the mid-17th century had a continuous form of development for our country, and Cromwell was known to represent a part of that division.
The successes are as respected and remembered as a king on the throne.
The killer, Asama, was injured by a Chinese pencil.

The remains of the Rhosa hurricanes cause large and heavy rains to the southwest of U.S.A.
As foretold, the Rosa Hurricane is worn by cold water in northern Mexico.
However, the following days Rosa will bring flooding rains in northern Mexico and southwest U.S.
Rosa had an hourly 85-milles wind, 1 slopes. On Sunday afternoon, and on Punta Eugina 385 Miles, southwest of Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to travel north.
In the meantime, it is beginning to take shape on a peaceful ocean and to travel to the west coast of U.S.A., when Rosa is approached to Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to move to the southwest west of U.S.A. to the north.
On Monday, in a part of Mexico, Rosa rains 10 inches.
Then, when the tropical man comes to the moisture, he meets the corridor, the next day, it is a great rain in the southwest.
Nearly 1 to 4 inchs of rain may cause dangerous floods, clouds, and desert dirt.
Deep tropical moisture, especially in southern Navada and Arizona, causes rainfall between 2 and 3 hours.
In most parts of Arizona, rains between 2 and 4 are expected.
There can be a flood of rainfall caused by tripical rainfall.
It is not very wise to walk to the desert when it threatens to be a tropical rain.
It makes heavy rainy valleys strong rivers, causing thunderstorms to produce strong winds and dust jars in the area.
The approaching eruption brings some environmental rains on the southern border of California.
Over half of the inch, a total of rain can lead to a slighter and fragile road.
This season of humidity may be the first rain.
The rains begin on Monday and Tuesday before they begin to spread on Sundays and Monday mornings, and some dispersed tropical rains begin to approach Arizona.
A heavy rains flow from Tuesday to Easter on all four corners.
As the Arctic deteriorates, there may be some strong heat changes throughout the U.S.A. in October, but tropics remain hot.
Sometimes this leads to unexpected changes in the short distance of heat.
Unexpected warming differences are a great example in the Central USS on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa has a temperature of about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try to re-establish and expand.

More than 20 million people have seen the Prit Kavanach Court.
More than 20 million people have witnessed a spectacular testimony on the cinema TV nets, which was accused of the sexual assault of Bright Kavanac, the Hamousse Supreme Court, and Christine Blasay Ford, in the 1980 ’ s.
In the meantime, the political opposition continues, and the colds have interrupted their regular program for the last four minutes: Effbyai's agreement on the Arizona Senator Jeff Fleek to carry out a week's examination of the charges.
Ford says that at a high school feast in Kavanahh, the Senate Justice Committee is confident that they have joined her and tried to dismantle her clothes.
Kavanah said that they were not sure of their emotional testimony.
In the report, Nilson pointed out that Wednesday may have seen more than 20.4 million people.
The company accounted for the average number of observers in the SBIS, ABC, ABC, CNN, Fox News Channel, Fox Basins Netwerk, and EMISENBIS.
The number of other nets showed, including PPIs, CSS and Fox Basins Netwerk, was immediately missing.
And Nilson is often a problem in measuring those who see him as an office.
The number of observers to take that view is similar to that of a football game or the academy award.
Fox News Channel, who strongly supported Kavanach's appointment, said Nilson, had led all the Netwercos by an average of 5.69 million people throughout the day.
ABC was 3.26 million second.
SBIS 3.1 million, ABC 2.94 million, EMAS 2.89 million, and CN 2.52 million.
After his trial, he continued to have a high level of interest.
Fleek was a middleman on Saturday's drama.
After describing his choice of Kavanach and his support to the High Republic office, when they attempted to take a pilgrimage to the justice committee, they were molded by protesters on Friday morning by the CEN and CEBS cameras.
A spread has been spread in the CEN as they stood up for a long time in the face of opposition, pushing their necks to Mart.
One woman said, "I'm standing in front of you."
Do they think that they are telling the truth about the country?
"Many women have no power, but you have power."
According to Fleek, the office has issued a statement and they can say more during the committee's trial before the cheek is closed.
When the Justice Committee voted for the full election of the Kavanah candidate, the Kepl and Brudchest Nets were all directly distributing.
But Fleek said that he could do this only by realizing that he would see the protest in the next week, as did the Febie, who had been dragged by a few democracys.
Fleek, after talking to their friend, Senator Chris Kons, admitted in part.
After speaking with Kuns and several senators, Fleek passed their decisions.
Fleek's choice has the power, because the Republicans will certainly not get the sound needed to correct Kavanac outside of the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI check on Kavanah's accusations.
The British Prime Minister May Hayayan is accused of playing the ‘political play’ above the prestige.
In their interviews with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa Mayi alleged that Hayasian was taking his plan to get out of the European Union as "British interest and national interest" as a result of a erosion of national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa May, 29 September 2018, entered the Bermingham Confederation, Britain.

"That's what you're always worried about," says Wade.
A volcanic eruption in Mexico City
Ash from the Popoctatétel volcano has reached Mexico's Mede and southern residential camps.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to leave the area after the volcanic activity began in the trunk and announced 183 gas releases within 24 hours.
The center was under the control of a number of violent screams and earthquakes.

The fact that the police gave a voice of freedom before the annual celebration of Catalan was in conflict with the Catalans.
On Saturday, after fighting with the laundry police, six people were arrested in Barcelona, and thousands protested against the annual celebration of the Banging of Katalonian.
A cloud of dust clouds has often been set up on the streets of visitors, which is often folded by eggs and insected flour.
At the end of the day, beatings were inflicted, and the police used smugglers to stop the beating.
Long-hour collision teams sang, "No forgetting, no forgiveness," and those supporting unity sang, "Get in Spain forever."
According to the local newspaper, four-three people were treated lightly.
After the October 1 Reefrandm was taken as a war in Madrid and was respected by the scourges, the demand for freedom of the searching area continued sharply.
Although fewer people have been found on the noise of protesters, they have chosen to be highly free of choices.
Like Katalan authorities, last year the police were injured by some 1000 people in a violent conflict throughout the region to stop the voice of the election stations.
On Wednesdays, the freedom supporters of the groups spent the night in order to defend the national police.
The protest has been fought, but it has a different way.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes Catalonia, who joined the electricians and their owners in the armed conflict, said that they had no hope of freedom.
"The past year we spent one of our best lives.
I have seen my parents read with joy that they can make a sound, but now we're standing."
Although in the past the box can be recorded with environmental preferences and are useful, most of the parties that promote Katalan’s brushing have found it difficult to protect their enthusiasm as they awaited trial in prison because of their role in the Revision and the subsequent Declaration of Freedom.
According to 42-year-old Mechanic Houan Puig, the fight was being launched by both politicians.
"The stress is getting greater," he said.
Since last year, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the Pre-Trial Court have announced that Oriol Juanquéras will compete in the European Parliament election on Saturday.
"We have been able to see from the Spanish government that participating in European choices helps us to observe and recognize the values of democracy and pressures to go unnoticed," he said.

The Holts group should use the reingers' problems without being scattered.
Scott Robinson is turning his face to the Golan, and he has been seen trying to get only the most convenient balls for the Karyg Hatz.
His concern is that there is a chance for the alien group to be disturbed by the fact that the reingers played with them.
The role of ethical counting is incomplete.
When the Rangers were punished, Living Stone joined Dicklan Galager and Robinson together, turning the ball that Menga had received from them from the middle of the field to the top.
Although the Renders were overcoupled by ball control at this time, they were able to defend themselves and their goal was greater than the stability of Liam Kelly.
Although the situation continued in this way, Alfredo Morillos used Heil on Kelly.
Alan McGreer and Ligau are in conflict with the players of Living Stone.
When Livingston was repeatedly violated and easily invaded, and Heckets, who had changed Milton’s legacy, had a two-pronged chance of being retrieved, especially one.
It was a whispering game of Livingston when we were intrigued.

He said that 540 people were wounded and 29 people were killed.
Nugarho can raise the death and destruction of the Donggala coast, 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palo, which is about the middle of the earthquake.

The American Artificial Intelligence should double its financial support for the Artificial Intelligence
Since China is strengthening its participation in the Artificial Intelligence, American study and research should be paid twice as much as it now spends to the Gulf, Microsofts and Apple companies, who produced the Investor and Artificial Intelligence Corporate Cay-Fu
The comment followed by the various parts of the American government, the country, as well as the strategy for the artifacts of the Intelligence.
However, China has announced her country in the past half of 2030 to become an artifact in the arthematic Intelligence Section No. 1.
"We are working to bring about a significant change in other countries, as if they could be a good start when they were too far away from power. "
In an interview with Lee C.B.C.A. this week, Lee said that the increase in the financial support would make the next major discovery American.
Li writes: “China, Silicon Valley, and New World Order are the architects of Hogton Miflyn Harcourt, Face++ of China. The Artificial Intelligence Campaigns, one of the main directors of the Senior Winchers Company, published this month.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellen, he established a system of artifacts in the Otelo Games of America, and then continued to carry out the research and research of Microsofts and the Gulf China branch.
According to Lee, the former American government calls for similar competitions to be made in order to identify a future generation, such as the Defens Advansed Resourcing Projects, by mentioning the roles of the Egensive Robotics Chalenege in technology
Restorers in America have pointed to the need to work hard to overcome the Kingdom’s financial resources:
"China isn't the Corporate leaders, the companies are," he said.
Facebook, Google and Microsofts have taken highly hopeful students to work on the Artificial Intelligence.
According to Lee, the change of the refugee police has a high contribution to the efforts of China and the Arthical Intelligence.
I think that "Green cards should be prepared for students working in artifacts, "
China State Council issued the program in July 2017.

The Macedonians made a public decision on whether the name of the country would be changed or not
Last Sunday, the country that the Macedonians made a public decision decided that the Republic of North Mexico would be called or not, and that the country would be freed from the European Union and Neto’s conspiracy with Greece.
Similarly, Greece, which has the name of Macedonia, has used the right to vote and not to be a member of both the Neto and the European Union.
Although the two countries agreed on this name in June, they objected to the nationalist protesters that it would undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavic people.
When President Georgi Ivanov said that they would not vote in the repermanence, he was concerned that there would be a similar non-audible campaign, and that the public's decision would be possible for the people to obtain the 50 persons that they wanted:
The question on the sound paper is read: "They choose to stop marrying Greece and become a member of the Union of Netto and Europe."
The supporters of the changeover, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that it is worth paying to join the Union of Neto and Europe, which is moving forward among the countries of Yugoslavia that have violated the decision.
"I have come here today to choose what is best for tomorrow, especially for young people in Macedonia, to live freely under the shadow of the European Union, because this makes us all enjoyable lives."
Although not banned by law, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have stated that they will be submissive and that they will accept it as crucial by the voice given.
In order to apply the name change, two third members of Parliament must be heard.
The nation's Selection Committee (ECM) reported that there was no problem with selection at 1 p.m..
16 percent of the parliamentary voted against last year was 34 percent, but 66 percent of the votes recorded in this option were voted.
"I have come to give a voice because of my children: my home is Europe." 62-year-old Josie Tanšski, who gave a voice in the capital city Skopje.
Mexican prime minister Zoran Ziev, whose husband, Zorica, and their son Duschko, voted on the refurbishment of the country on the 30th day of September 2018, which helped to combine Neton and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov planted a small set of platforms and placed seats in front of the tent.
"We are with Neto and the European Union, but when we combine, we have a straight neck, not to be a lowest use to others," said Kovadakov.
"We are the poor country, but we have glory."
If we don't accept as Macedonia, we will join the European Asian union by turning our face to China and Russia."
According to Secretary Zhav, being a member of the Netto country brings a lot of success to Macedonia, where the number of work employed is over 20 percent.
“It is my belief that more than 80 percent of our citizens will support the European Union and Neton, ” says Záve after giving a voice.
As he says, the "yes" results are the next confirmation of time.
The Mexican Police Research Institute, in its public opinion last Monday, found that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters were involved in the refurbishment, and this was the lowest vote.
According to another Mexican telegram survey, 57 percent of the participants were willing to vote on Sunday.
70% of the respondents claimed to vote "yes".
To make the refurbishment a success, one response must be 50% plus one voice.
The collapse of the Republic of Western Europe is a reflection of the first failure of the policy that has taken place since last month May.

Western Virginia’s Trump’s Support Fight
The president of the Supreme Court, Bright Kavan, said it would be helpful to win the best half of the republics.
"Everything we did in November followed you.
The most important choice we have made in our life has passed five weeks since it was made.
This is one of the big ones. I'm not running. I'm running well, but I'm running well.
As Trump continues, "You have seen this frighteningly sordid group of democracy, and you have noticed what is going on.
They are also trying to use whatever option they can. You have seen their own misguided and immorality.
They want to take power and control it, and we don't give it to them.
They said, "Democrats are on the mission of protest and extermination."
In the past four days, he was calling democracy "enraged, unfeeling, clever and liars"
He raised the Senate's Gulf Committee and heard a loud voice from the top of the top, when it called St. Danny Fencette, the Democrats.
"Remember her tongue?
Is the document out of your hand?

"Not at all, I'll never give a chance-- that bad sign language. From the worst sign language I've ever seen.
In the Church, there has been a breeding ground.
Those who speak of all their minds are impatient.
Amazingly, many jobs in my party failed to be recognized
I am the best person to talk about the truth with the Libert MPs, but I am unacceptable. All of them are talking about what we think.
The same is true of my MP, John Ryan, because it is a deliberate campaign to dissuade her.
I don't agree with Germie Corb, and I'm hosting a lot of talks about the campaign to dissuade me.
Other privileges that are not agreed upon by the political, national security, and former leaders of Europe and Germany
"As the Notingham East Libert meeting published last Friday, "We want to attend and be productive"
During my eight-year stay at Leebre MP, I had the choice of the Friday evening GC meeting.
Sadly today, it may not be the voice of many gatherings, and it has been a long time since the politics of "goods, young people" — perhaps without a new start.
There is a growing lack of hospitality for special ideas at the Liberty Party, and only if they are accepted by the party leaders.
This began some time after the German leadership, and when I was together, I had thought that I would be able to accept and support the so-called political attitudes that I would agree with the national security or the single market of the European Union.
When I speak in public, there is no problem with what we say: misunderstandings are presented by the international media that are creating problems, opposition to politics and that I must not remain in the Liberation Party.
And this is not my experience.
Of course, I believe that I am better than my friends, because the comments that come to me are political.
I am grateful to my own professionals and my colleagues who face the most serious sexual and racial attacks they face every day.
Political anger is the fact that the impact is common.
The last week, Jerby Corbin pointed out that the Liberty Party should develop a culture of patience.
The fact is that there is no great church, and the change in the choice of mosquito wham, where there is no confidence in each, will also make the party weaker.
"For the past two years, I have received advice that I should lower myself and not become a lot of people, and now I have been successful."
But I didn’t bring it into politics
Inspired by the government of Tatter 32 years ago, I thought that I would be able to be a minister of the Kingdom of the same area in the Public Serves when I followed Libern’s joining the government, as a result of my overall low educational outcome.
I have not hidden my political views, including the choice of the past.
No one in the West of Nottingham is confused by my political stand and does not agree with the current leaders.
On the basis of my loyalty to the Libert Party, I could not spend money on the time of the Bree-Egypt, knowing that it would affect the country's living conditions, Buenos Aires and the public service.
I have a message, not to stop the activities of Notinham, but also to the Kingdom. This is about the Liberty Party and the others. I am proud to serve in the field, and it does not prevent me from fulfilling your wishes and believing in any threat or political convenience.
Chris Leslie is a MP of West Nottingham.

"Thanks be to Ayr, and they have made better pleasures than we do."

In the long run of Ruaredi Nott, he was able to follow Ayr’s leadership in Staford McDowell, following the fact that he was out of play from the beginning.
When Ayr Blessing Bayperson's well-moved Ayr Bless Card, he followed the pressure of the game, and Melros was replaced by Brook Colvin.
Despite the excellence of the outskirts, when Strawan Hutchensen saw a yellow climat outside the penal zone, the best Ayr Macperson was moved backwards.

In the 19th century, when the sea gate on the other side of Bolivia is largely bloody, the shoreline of the Riches Conflict is eager to capture the Pacific Ocean, notwithstanding the fact that it has been taken in Chile.

According to Rye, continuing the camp is a "superfine dream", and the announcement of the end of the war of the two Koreans does not confer on North Korea the reluctance to accept America.

John Edward: The language skills of international citizens are useful.
Private schools in Scotland have been able to record the most significant results of 2018: they have been able to achieve a strong role in individuals and groups in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
In over 30,000 students in Scotland schools, the schools were represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, and the schools sought to provide the students and parents with a very good service.
Private schools are working with the aim of reinforcing their students to choose a higher education as a citizen for the next.
As a system of education, and as a teaching expert, modern languages have become elective topics in the schools, including their modern fame.
Nelson Mandela says, "May be able to understand when you talk to the language speaker.
"At the time you talk to the language speaker, it's one of the minds."
It should be noted that we must not rely solely on English to establish contact with other nations and to build faith.
The results of this year's private schools are shown to be high on the basis of the language table.
68% of the students have opened up in foreign languages, that is, A.
According to data from the SCI and 74 member schools, 72 percent of the students recorded the highest A results, 69 percent of French, and 63 percent of Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland have acknowledged the value of foreign languages for young people and their future for young people.
Today, in private schools, it teaches as one of the subjects of STEM languages (Science, Technology, Engineering and History).
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission on Workers' Creation, the study showed that 17 percent of the workers were the main cause of language problems because they had difficulty filling up the drugs on the job.
Therefore, the fact that young people have a lot and a lot of linguistic skills is very useful for their future work.
The linguistic skills of most jobs are useful in a linguistic world.
Not in the workplace, but in the light of the person's choice. Learning a second language will have similar benefits that will last with them.
Those who speak many languages to communicate directly with foreign nationals win the race over.
According to Yugov, in 2013, the choice of more than 4000 UK young people is the only language spoken in French (15 per cent) that is the only language spoken by 75 per cent of foreign countries to communicate with others.
This is why it is very important to spend on teaching children's languages.
The fact that many languages are available, especially for those who are developing their economy, creates a meaningful career for children.
In Scotland, every school is distinguished from the language of each school.
Many schools teach more modern languages, while others, such as Mandarin or Japan, think about the future of 2020 and teach that the United Kingdom is the most useful language.
Regardless of your son's wishes, whatever the language he wants to learn in private schools, he is also assisted by specialists who have done so.
Scotland's private schools are determined to create an environment for children to be successful in the future and for a skilled owner.
The world’s Byzantine region is a very useful place for the future of countries, so it should not be forgotten that language should be included in school at this time.
Modern languages should indeed pay attention to the "International Cooperative Skills".
Private schools continue to provide Scotland youths with prominence and preferences.
The no faire faut.
John Edward is the director of Scottish Private Schools.
He will bring Bron Lakers to San Diego for the first time on Sunday.

West Virginia’s Time of Trump, Jutiub Channal
President Trump set up a series of campaigns in Huilling, West Virginia, at night
Eike is one of the five supports of Trump’s next week’s plan, including the stay of friends Tennessee and Mississippi
Since the vote required to confirm the appointment of the Supreme Court was halted, Trump Kongersu was planning to collect support for the Republic during the next November election half of the time.
The West Virginia movement of the Trump is on how much time today, and how can it be kept online?
The Trump of Hulling, West Virginia, was planned for action by 7piem. Saturday evening on the Easter calendar, September 29, 2018.
The West Virginia movement of Trump can be seen directly by the Ethiopian.
This week, when Trump was expected to speak in the case of Rit Kavanouh at a meeting of the president of the Supreme Court, the candidate thought that he would be very complex because of his inappropriate practice in respect of freeness of speech, he could make a sound that would allow him to prolong a week until the Effbyai had completed his examination.
The objective of this series of movement is to enable the Republic to gain the capacity for the distressing choice of November.
Thus, according to the President's Trump campaign, the next week's five movements aim at “supporting and expanding the Republican's top seat in the Senate and the Council of Representatives by stimulating goodwill and supporters”, according to Reuters.
"Congratulations are his main sponsors, as we approach the President Fata campaign, they go to as many states as possible," said to Reuters by the Spokesman of the Trump campaign, who wanted not to mention his name.
In Wiesbaneko Are and Hulling, today's activists are expected to “assemble supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania; the Pittsburgh Metero, ” according to West Virginia report.
Trump West Virginia will visit on Saturday for the second time last month, which won over 40 per cent in 2016.
Trump seeks to help the Western Virgin Republic to help Patrick Morissan, the favorite candidate of the Senate
“The president's presence is not a good sign for Morisse, ” says a political scientist from West Virginia, Simon Heir, according to the report of Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup of the American Video is held among unmarried people to give a life for a poetry
It seems that after a race on the side only of the South, the race between four people after the weekend seems to be needed to include it in this Rider cup.
The smuggler's sports game is an invention of sports athletes, and they believe in all of this.
So when does it come to be?
"Six points have been led, and now four, so I guess we're taking it as a little higher," he was walking slowly.
Europe has a better advantage, leaving four games behind
The Americans feel that, as Spain believes, they have a very narrow fate, even though they have a high chance of strengthening themselves, especially those who play together all day long, such as Spain and Justin Thomas, each one of whom receives a four-six points.
Spain is a murderer, and he is an example leading T-Green.
As his circle continues to grow, these cheers and shouts are increasing, using crucial and effective hits to bring the fourth game together, and he and Thomas down the second.
The winning of the 15th poetry is similarly shocked by the shout, which makes you believe that the American group is not outside of competition.
"In fact, you should be thoroughly investigated and worried about your arguments," says Sepeis.
This is the main thing that each player ignores.
18 Signed Rings
Over the past two years, the only players, Francisco Molinari and Tommy Phillywood, are the best of Spain and Thomas, is a fair story.
Europe's glaucoma, but its favorite pair is four and nothing is wrong with you.
After Saturday hours, Mollywood was the only one that could not be placed in a pit of bamboo, and Saturday morning was the same as the same one.
All the runners and those who were being sealed to the supporters and those who were in charge of them seemed to be winning the Sunday poem, and there was no known player who could seal the Europeans, and the result was that the sun fell on the Molenari for Golf Naschnah and Filitwood.
In a preferable way, both sides are in different holes.
Although there is no time to talk about Europeans' dignity, it is not possible to talk about it.
Bubba Watson and the Semson Web were working a little on Sergio Garcia, one of the twins of the morning, and joined Alex Norne.
Spaniards and Swedish have counted the pits before me by putting them in one place and two pairs of goals that they did not know before.
Even if no one can help on Sunday, get your head out of your pit.
The two-and-four-five games are very exciting to see closely, and to see how the interfaith between the couples can change, consult, consult, and instant.
Europe has already played better as a team and has become the leading leader on the end day, but as the four players have shown, Tim America has been suspicious, even though it has been on the Statesside.
Europe 10 - 6 led to the end of the Rider cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage until the end of Rider's cup, which is guided by 10-6 Americans, reversing from Saturday to four.
Tymothy Flytwood and Francisco Molenari have been led by two winners in Tagai Tiger Wood, and they have raised four national points of Lake Golf.
Through the Europeans, Thomas Bijournes was able to remove Hazeltai’s cup two years ago, to catch a 3-1 row on the list, which was more than the United States, which had been fired outside the top of the morning game.
By better coping with the four games, America won two games, but could not eat as much as it could fill the flaws.
Eight points from Sunday’s 12 single poems are needed to keep the cup left through Jim Furik
Fleetwood, a new European boy who had four successive points, and he and Molinari, Moliwood, called the instant name, are a second step in the Rydar cup story, followed by the happy end of the week.
After composing Woods and Patrique on the Indone Gallery, they went in a fine manner to win Woods’ breathing and Bryson Deschamaba's new American son 5&4.
Woods went into two games on Saturday's gaming, but he qualified the usual, and 19 out of 29 games were defeated in pairs and four and seven successively.
Justin Rose, who spent the morning two pairs of races on rest, returning to four games with his friend Henry Stenson, won Dustin Johnson and Brook Coypane - the world's first and third.
Despite a beautiful windstorm in West Paris, what Europe did not find
On Saturday, with two points, Jordan Spices and Justin Thomas, the winners of the Soviet Union, set an example for the Americans.
In a game in Spain, John Rahm Rahm and Ajan Palter found a reflective point, and then Paulter and Rory Macroin were able to win 4&3 in four.
Although he wants to save his cup through Furic without any objective, it is only two times that a four-point flaw team can return to the single game.
For two seconds, it seems that Sunday's response attack is beyond their reach.
Northern Korea said that she would not be fired with a war of faith, "not at all."
As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United States on Saturday, there was no way for the ongoing siege to devote its confidence to the United States and thus to halt its nuclear weapons.
As Joung Ho told the entire international institution, North Korea had taken good action over the past two months, for example, to stop the experiment of Newklina and Misael, to destroy its location, and to prevent the Newክሊer.
"But we didn't get a suitable response from the Americas."
"We cannot trust our national security without any faith in Mary, and we can't put ourselves in the war in the first place in such a situation. "
When Reim expressed the same common resentment in North Korea, he said that she was refusing to hold arms from Newcastle and thus refusing to give up her rightly reward to North Korea, the statement made it seem necessary that Pyongyang did not completely abandon the nuclear masorrhage she had done in the past.
When Ry cites the joint statement given by Kim John U and Trump, the president of the United States and the leader of North Korea on the first occasion in Singapore, and Kym promises to secure the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to end the 1950-53 war in an opiate manner, and America has to put ahead of its Newclier architecture.
Washington also objected to the call to revise the Northern Korea slippery.
"America first asks for an "out-of-nuclear-army ", and forcibly uses an effort to bring it in, and "opposes even the declaration of cessation of war," says Rie.
" Trying to bolster our knees by using a siege is an invincible dream and the ignorant people who do not know us.
The ongoing crisis has deepened our trust in one another.
The second time, Ry said that there was a Trump and Trump congregation in Kim, he did not mention what had been the result of the United States leadership.
The Ministry, not only raised in Kimma and Marie Mun J-Een, South Korea, was about the last five months of the three-month meetings, adding: “The issue of the elimination of Newclier, not of America, was not about the problem of releasing Korea from South Korea.”
Although Rie's voice is very different from last month, it is after the "Mir Wicked President" of the Trump Kim, a "Rocket man" that has been the target of the entire United States.
Just as Trump did not intimidate North Korea to destroy its " full-fledged " in the past year, and Kim said that in this clock, he was grateful for what was being done to resolve the war, but that many jobs were still lost and that he would continue to destroy North Korea's new-clittered architecture.
"If it takes two minutes, it will take a third month or five months."
China and Russia are controversial with the United States. The Security Council should be awarded for the process of going to Pyongyang.
However, according to the United States Security Council, chief secretary Michael Pompey to the United States, the Security Council must continue on Thursday, "The Security Council must continue to keep the process of releasing the Nicoler arm until the results come. "
Since 2006, the Security Council undertook to discontinue financial support to the Pyongyang and the Listique Mission.
Pumpio and Rhine, who are at the side of the European Union, have come to visit Pinjang for a second discussion the following month, as the whole congregation says.
Pompio Semein Korean visited for the third time this year alone, but the third visit did not have as much effect as possible.
When Julie Pyonyang was released in the month, it was revealed that the changes were being organized in different hours, expressing their record.
This month, in the North Korea meeting with Moon, the United States stated that it had to take a "similar step" to destroy their facilities and Nicoler's immobilization.
According to Kim, they are “similar steps” to ensure their safety, and Trump says that the relationship with Washington, which they have made in Singapore, is better.
Harvard students learned about getting sufficient rest.
This year, all Andrew-Graduate students at Harvard University were shown to be trained to stop study experience using sufficient sleep and 'many caffeines'.
The world’s world’s number of young students is said to have been low in understanding of the basics and how they see themselves.
At Harvard School of Medicine, a professor of sleep and sleep therapy, Charles Essler, a specialist at Bermingham and the Hospital of Women, and a course that they believe to be special in the United States hospital.
Lack of sleep has been motivated to start training on the impact of education.
At the end, a woman came to me, and said, "Why is he told me now? Why didn't he tell me in the past years?"
He told the telegraph that he was astonished when he said that no one would be able to tell her about the benefits of bedtime.
The first one to be given in this minute shows that good sleep helps to better make education and athletics and to protect their health in general.
As Paul Barrera, the chief director of the University's health service, professor of the Harvard Medical School, decided to introduce the course after seeking and finding students with severe sleep problems during the week.
Clock training has a lot to do.
In one class, the school room — the students holding coffee, the curtain, the trainers, the influence of Capine and light, and the lack of adequate sleep — suggest that they follow the athletic qualifications, regularly respecting bedtime.
Participants in the other part are told that long-time sleeplessness increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, courage and cancer.
The training trainers are encouraged to think about their personal actions in the internal map.
We know that the behavior of students does not change immediately.
We believe that they have the right to know: like you, you have the right to know about the health impact of smoking.
There is still a culture of pride by sleepless nights: modern technology, as he says, is a growing problem of sleeplessness following the pressure on students.
Be assured that you have sufficient sleep with good rest: this is a mysterious tool for teaching to stop anxiety, tiredness and fear, which, as he says, reduces weight, reduces sleep loss, and makes us feel hungry and hungry.
19-year-old California chemical and physicist biology, assisted with Professor Seissler of the course, who last year stayed in the first year of the University of Havard and attended the course one day.
He explained that he had made the course open and encouraged him to take other courses in the building.
Next, he hoped that all the postgrazoid students should follow similar programs and that they should complete training before going to more competitive institutions.
Professor Chesler advises that students should be aware that they must use irrigation to go to bed and to get up from bed and that e-screen and LED-free blue lights are damaged; they also make heartbeat trouble and trouble sleeping.
Living Stone 1-0 Rengers: Menga's goal is disheartened by Jerard's players.
Rengers have been fascinated by the defeat of the Rangers, and the attack by Dolly Minga has led to a 1-0 defeat by the Stephen Gerald.
Ever since the 4-1 winners of Ibrooks in Sangotz, they have tried to register their first victory, but the Gary Holtz team has been weakened.Jerard, at the 18th game, has dissuaded the eighth stage of his success.
The first half of Manga was about seven minutes left tired, and the Rengers played the field in a good way.
Now that the Rengers are down to the sixth, Living Stonans are overflowing in Liberia to the sixth.
The Renders are expected to have another turmoil: if the harlots were to be thrown away from Spain, it would have damaged his head.
Jerard made eight interesting changes in the half-start of Beth Fred and the game of Ayr outside the race.
In other words, when they can beat Harts with Livi 11 last week, they are happy to be able to worry about their rivals in all games.
Rangers were better at control of the ball, but Living Stonans have also been seen doing something better in the ball.
In the Minga goal of Animagregers, they must follow Scott Pitman out of the race and set goals in two minutes, but they can expand their chances.
When Kyrgyzstan's friend, Kig Helket, who was strenuously accompanies the Kighan Jacob, tried to entice his defense friend Allen to go to the goal.
Rangers were good at ball control, and they have a better hope than they believe in a third-party game.
Alfredo Morlos and Stephen Lowles were at the first quarter of the hour, but Judge Stephen Thompson ignored the Colombian questions.
In the first half, the Rangers tried two balls that waited for them, and the former Ibrooks deputy Liam Kelly was disturbed by the balls of Lassa and Colibli and the horrific experiments of Ove Ijaria.
Livi's 34-minute key is against the game of championship, and no one denies it as it should be.
Rengers are unable to talk to Jacob again.
Scott Arfield, like Dicklan Galagher, gave her ball to Scott Robinson.
1]Jerard was able to replace Rhine Kent with the Culibalin, and he tried to protect Marilou’s wing gaps as soon as he was able to create greater influence by pushing away.
But Living Stones must use long balls in order to play a game of enthusiasm that the guest group enjoys.
In Holts, while strengthening their leadership in the last circles, he tried to stop MacGreer Jacob before the attack started out of the corner.
Although Glen Midelton, who was changed from Rengers, followed by Jacob and demanded that his sentence be reimbursed, Thompson ignored him.

But over a year, there are 100,000 people in China who live with HIV.
Transfer of HIV in agriculture is a major issue in the Eljibete community of China.
A similar act of aggression, which was established as a crime in China in 1997, has been said to be increasingly committed by Soma and Eljibite.
Studies suggest that 70-90% of males who have committed sexual immorality can marry at the end of the country's traditions.
Most of the HIV spread is that these discoveries have not been sufficiently cautious.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to promote HIV therapy as a country.
Maxie Waters denied the Gup Senator Data and the explosion of "hazard liars" and "Serra’s Plan of Action" Massloku
America, like Maxie Waters on Saturday, accused a workmate to write personal information from our South American Senator on the Parliamentary Oceania.
According to Losangela's democracy, it is a "crambled wings" and a website that are being reconsidered.
"False lies and many shameful lies," Woter put it on Twitter's face.
The information that was released included your address to the United States home and telephone. The Century of South Carolina Lindsay Graham, Mike Li and Orin Hah both of Otah.
The information was presented on the Internet by a man who was not known to be in Cathytol Hill, at the time counseled by the Senate Panal, a candidate of the Supreme Court of the Prosecution, on a sexually illegal act of Ret Kavanu.
It was after the three centurions asked Kavanouh questions.
A custodian website, such as Gate Way Pande and Red State, is connected with the Water's office, and is released by Water's author, according to The Hil.
"This foundation is a total lie, Waters," said.
"My workmate who he is, his personal information and security have been damaged by this false and fraudulent crime, and he has never been responsible for this misinformation.
It's a lie that the foundations are full of crime."
Wait Hass, former Pres and Price Secretary Ari Fleischer, was a quick critic of Wait Hass.
"This apostasy was anger," wrote Fleicher.
"This shows that she has no patience to be a member of the Congress.
They should not be angry when someone is convicted of unemployed work.
They should not be reluctant.
They should not be asked what the male's interest is.
They have to be calm and peaceful.
Fleicher attempts to compare the situation of Water's democracy with that of Judge Kavanu, who criticized the 5th Council.
In the Middle Ages of the election, Omar Navarro, who compared Water with her seat, heard his voice in Twitter.
"If it's true," he whispered.
According to Wotters, the office has changed this fraudulent crime "in the right authorities and law enforcement bodies.
"We make sure that they are exposed to the act", and we are responsible for the law for any members of our submarines and for all their destructive and dangerous actions. "
Johnny England Strayct - Big-Bussy of Rowan Atkinson Smuggle
Now, it is common to see the need in new films, and the reason for the breeding of Johnny's British Academy is that it was started in 2003 by Johnny Shaw England and by Johnny and England in 2011.
Would Tang in Chike be rubbing on our own how the new foreign trade would be so good that it would show us how dirty mothers are?
In any case, Pap Ide, Goma, John England has been renewed for the second time to beat things.
Indeed, he is an unprofitable spy, even though a little spectacularly close to Close, the spirit of Mr. Ben, and the theme of 2012 for Cherriots of Fair have little to do with the opening of London Olympic.
First, the traveller's and uncircumcised mystery was played on the Barclaycard TV advertisement that was now forgotten at Atkinson, and he raised a lot of controversy before it began.
There is one or two good times on this new JJ visit.
I liked Johnny, England, when he was wearing a helicopter, helmet, and helmets, from the top to the bottom of the medieval era.
Atkinson's ridiculous gift is being visited, but his leisure, especially like 007 and Mishnan's impossibly, is inexplicable and inexperienced when compared with Comede's goals.
It doesn't seem that the fun of the usefulness is children, and Johnny England's disturbed turmoil is seen in Personnel of Ben, with the audible voice of Atkinson.
The current theme is that Britain's biggest is in serious trouble.
A Siberian British spies' bond broke into Web and exposed the identity of the British spies in the field to the point of shocking the small and low role of the Sean Kevin Eldon.
It is the last of the prime ministers who are boastful and unsuccessful, especially those who are losing their political capacity. Emma Thompson does everything she can, but nothing is done in this false character, Teresa May.
Announced by the Intelligence counselor, each of them was injured, so she had to bring a retired person.
That means that the confused John England himself, who is now a director of a wealthy school, but the teaching is how to be a secret spy, some good bags say that England has a school of celestials like rocks.
England was reintroduced to Whithol for an urgent statement, where he was able to meet again with his assistant Boh, who had suffered a lot of hardship, and ben Miller again played.
Boh is now married, a shipwreck has been joined by a shipwrecker, a beautiful man and a hoky doula player, and this is Vicky Peedin Back.
So the issue of Alga Kurilekon's daughter, Fem Fatale Opelan Bulletova, has been reinstated by Bathman and Robin on all the rigid issues of the queen's grievances.
In the meantime, the prime minister is at the hands of the evil Tech billionaire, hoping that he will solve British computer problems, and the rich Jacques Volta has seen it in Jack Lassie.
England and Boh began their warm journey: They don't burn a French restaurant, as if it were a host, and they made it difficult to escape themselves on the Volta Lantern ship.
For the last series, all stops have come out with certainty, but since they are popular and warm, the situation is like a little child television in general.
My bracelet's not exaggerated.
Could not the British movie industry, Rowan Atkins, play a role in his talents?
Libert denied that he was working on a five-day payment plan for four days a week.
When the German Corbines Libert party announced that the English were going to set up a four-day plan for the week, he said that the payment would be five days.
It is said that the party wants to give workers one more day of rest to the time spent on the Artifical Intelligence (AI) revolution.
When employees use a weekend's rest, they take one row of money to the house, seeing it, but as it may be, to hear it.
They said that the reason is that the party agrees with the economic agenda, and that it has a plan, so that it is in a way that benefits the workers in the country.
The Society has been justified in the business community to make a four-day week fee to benefit from the shifting economic workers.
It is expected that a long-age labre party source will speak to Sunday Times before the end of the year for a policy review.
"Not at once, but four-day workdays the economic workers and the general industry leader's plan are a success that the party has hoped to regain balance with the following way."
In view of his commitment to the election campaign in 2017, the four-day work-week party of the Green party would not begin by making this comment publicly.
But what is hoped to succeed is not going on in a way that is now called a full-fledged party.
A spokesman for the Liberty Party said, "It's not a four-day party policy, nor is it taking into account the party."
Chado Chancellor John MacDonnel used the Leebre meeting last week to explain the vision more thoroughly to the Socialist Revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said that if they were in the service departments, they would be snuffed out of the power of the “nameless employers” and the “flee-catchers”.
Schado Chancellor plans also mean that they can't get their full share in the water companies because the Libert government can do "resettlement" as a result of a lawful act.
In addition, he confirmed ten percent to 500 pounds per cent of the shares of employees in companies' purchasing and privately owned property schemes.
Lindsley Graham, John Kennedy, says to '60 Minits' that the Effbyai's examination of Kavanah can change his mind.
Judge Bright Kavanahch sums up the question that the FABI examination has delayed the final vote of the Supreme Court, and that the Bureau's findings can bring any Republican centurions backing.
On Sunday's interview, "60 Ministries" news agent Scott Pellie asked the Republican centurions. John Kennedy and Lindsley found something that could change their minds.
Kennedy looked more clear than his friend Caroline from the south.
"I mean, correctly," said Kennedy.
"I was going to hear the testimony, and I was talking with Judge Kavanah."
After this happened, I called him, and the charges of guilt appeared, "You've done?"
The decision was firm, decisive, and unseen.
However, it seems that it is too difficult or impossible to change the graphic voice.
Brete has decided about your cavana, and has received a charge that can cause trouble.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Bright strongly clawed, Christine Blase Ford added to the vegetation.
And he could not vindicate any man which thou calledest by name.
The year is 36.
I don't see anything changing.
What has Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York prepares the Globe Sitz Festival, which has the mandate to end world poverty, such as this, where the moratoriums of astronomy are now the most entrenched.
Now tens of tens of thousands of people in the Global City Fastval, the seventh year, are gathered not only to entertain the Janette Jackson, but also to raise my understanding of the real goal of halting the worst poverty of Junior in 2030.
According to the Global Citizen Festival, in 2012, a global poverty project is a non-international group that believes that the number of people who fight poverty will be able to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in fighting poverty.
If you are not willing to pay Viapi's free ticket (unless you are willing/not/you are) the music feast participants had to complete their understanding of our small business or "dos", such as the service of goodwill, the writing of email to the world leader, the telephone call or other interpreter's goal to stop poverty.
But how successful is the Global Systems 12 years?
Is it because people think it is the right way to persuade people to look at the scene or because they think that "clicktivismm" has created a true difference in their online appeal or tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "enterprises" from its supporters, and this is moving him to set different goals.
These actions have led the world’s leaders to be concerned about their determination and to shape policies of over $37 billion, which can influence public life by 2030 and 2.25 billion.
In the early 2018, the group mentioned 390 works and declarations, at least $10 billion was paid or collected.
The group estimates that the money that has been found has an impact on the entire world's population of up to 649 million.
The U.S. Potential Potential for Food, U.S.A., has promised $35 million to help “strengthen children in their full capacity” in order to eliminate the shortage of adequate food for Rwanda if it comes from world citizens.
"We make a history of social injustice, with the support of the UK government, national governments, and the support of the world's citizens as you are, we make adequate food shortages a history of social injustice," said in London, in April 2018, a straightforward vision for the People's Power of Nutrition, Ambassador Tracey Ullman.
In the U.S., more than 5000 actions to improve mothers' and infants' diets have been supported by the Power of Nutrition Project, which over 5 million mothers and children have received by the government.
In response, a FAQ Web site asks: "What did you want us to do to eliminate the worst of poverty?"
The citizens of the world answer: "It will be a long and difficult way-- we sometimes come down and fall.
But like the great human rights and anti-Apartheid activities that existed before us, we are successful, for we are more powerful on our own.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe at Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are a few of the midwives who offer their work this year in New York.
Russian power sales outside can use its sea power to curb.
According to the U.S. spokesman Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner, says, "If necessary," the Russian power markets, including the central distance, can be turned to her power to prevent it.
Zinke clearly announced its intervention in Syria to the Russians, especially in the legal government.
“I believe that the reason why they entered the middle distance is to secure power, ” he reports, “as far as Europe, as it was to the southern innermost part of Europe. ”
And, in the opinion of the authorities, there are ways and methods to deal with the situation.
"The United States is able to make sure that the sea roads are open, and, if necessary, to shut down and to prevent their power supply from entering the market," he said.
Zinke in the United States is making it clear to the thunderstorms in the so-called "Voice of Power Users", the charity of the charity group.
He went to compare Washington's relationship with Russia and Iran, thinking that it was the same.
"Iran and Russia's choice of wealth is less, less, less, more fuel," said when he pointed out that Russia's quarrel-richness is only dependent on crude fuel.
The description came to replace Russia by replacing the Trump administration because it was to increase the most expensive choice for European users, the mission to send molten natural gas.
To this end, Trump authorities, U.S. president Donald Trump, including himself, is making an effort to get Germany a "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, from the Trump's view Berlin of the Moscow "Marcow".
As Moscow has repeatedly announced, the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 are twice as high as 110 meters of tunnels.
Kremlin argues that the high controversy that Kremlin has with the Washington project is an array of frivolous reasons and an argument of fair competition.
"I believe we share the view that power force cannot be a way of housing and that opponents should choose their neighbours" from the Russian Minister of Power Aleksandr Novak's meeting in September with the US Power Spokesman Rick Perry.
The U.S. comment has been strongly opposed by Germany, and has reaffirmed its determination to the project.
German Industries Federation, (BDI), the German Industries Organization of Industry called for an EU power policy and a two-party agreement in Berlin and Moscow.
In the recent German government leader Angela Merkel and the Russian president Vladimir Putin meeting, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf said, "I have a major problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply."

Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' “may be” selectors said they should not compete with the Legislative Council, such as the Suffolk University Politician Research Center/Boston Globe.

The U.S. ambassador is charged with "mouthing" by China's "propoganda ads.
The U.S.-China trade advertisement of the four pages of the U.S. daily newspaper published by the U.S. China newspaper has succeeded in distributing American publications to propaganda in China.
The U.S. President Donald Trump China, who denies China in Nov.6 U.S. Congress's election to intervene, raises the issue that led to the fact that De Moonee Register newspaper, which sells largely in Iowa State during the past decade, was paid in China.
The Trump case that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. options has led to a new phase of the growing campaign of pressure by the U.S. authorities to force Washington China.
While advertising is common for foreign governments to raise business, Bajiang and Washington are now involved in a virtuous trade war that has caused them to throw their circular interests on one thing.
Special experts of China and the U.S. states that China's early campaigns of retribution were designed to harm couriers who supported the Republic of Trump party, such as the Iowa State.
In China, the U.S. ambassador and agricultural products reported that the former long-term governor of Iowa, Terri Branstad Bagin, had damaged American workers, farmers and business.
"China's propaganda ads are now doublening its threat by making our own free signatures printed," Branstad wrote an opinion book in Sandys de Reggis.
"To spread the propaganda, the Chinese government is using the free speech and free printing culture in the United States to make payment announcements on De Monee Register, ” wrote Branstad.
“The contents of newspapers and polls in this Beijing street are limited to the voices of opposition, and the Chinese people have no real reflection of the various economic attitudes involved in China's problems, considering that the Midianian is under strict control in China's Communist party, ” he wrote.
He added: “The fact that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the request to print the text,” he did not say which newspaper was.
Analysts warn the republics that women’s selectors are being isolated from Kavanah before they reach half of their office
Many major republics have warned against the negative response, especially women, during the mid-option of their stand and protection, despite the question that Bret Kavanach has committed many sexual assaults against the flagrant general.
The feelings associated with this are very high, and most Republicans have clearly shown a desire to move forward by giving a voice.
"We can't take those things back," said Grant Richer, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, Maxwell, to The Hill, published on Saturday.
Reicher suspects that the final minute of the Effbya test of the Senator Jeff Fleek (Arrizona) is sufficient to ease the frustrating pressure of the selectors.
"Women don't forget what happened last night-- they don't forget tomorrow, in Novemburg", said counselor and national spokesman Carin Jean Pierre, like Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, when opposers shouted "November is coming!", he chose to go to Kavanah's front of the Sanitary Hall to fight peacefully. Christine Blacy Ford, Mike.
“ Democracy’s deepest desire and motivation will be removed from the registration table, ” said the politician who is not a member of any political party, his wife Rosenberg to the News Site.
"People say, 'He has already been lifted up,' but it is true.
But especially if the president does not like it, he may be able to raise up between female selectors who live out of towns and young selectors who are between 18 and 29 years of age.
Ford pointed out that before his testimony in the public prosecutor's case, he could have followed a strong negative response from the republics, who had been acquitted by the republics.
"This has become a problem for geopie", says Michael Steele, the former National Committee of the Republic of China, reported early last week by the Enbeci News.
“Not only because of sitting on the chair of the Committee's voice or final voice or cavannah, but because of the way the republics took it and treated it, ” said the director of the Prioritas U.S.A., who assists the selection of democracy, pointed to the press.
However, the Americans seem to believe what they should believe after Ford and Kavanahh's testimony, at least to a minimum, to a degree divided into two cases.
The new Yogov sound process shows that 41 percent of respondents believe the word for testimony in a form that is known to be certain or possible, and 35 percent believe in Kavanah in a form that is known to be certain or to be.
They also believe that 38 percent of the cavannahs believe that they lie when they give a testimony in a sense or in the form of a testimony, and that only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Fleek's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating charges of Fred and at least one accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testifies to Kavanah's 17-year-old death in drunkenness as she witnessed before the Senate Interpretation Committee at the bottom of Kahla Mahlah.
Ramirez is accused of exposing his organs before her in the 1980s when he attends a party.

MMA supporters watched Bellator 206 all night, and then found Pepa.
Think of this, they have been awake to the 206 Bellator together for the whole night.
I reached San Jose with 13 poems, six in the main card, and the evening in Channel 5 in the UK.
In 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other, the spread changed to Pepa pigs, and the UK observers were surprised.

In Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt a "low" feeling for all the survivors because he was not envious in his community to love men and women.
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority, and feelings of disparity, were real things that gave me the strength and strength to be a winner."
He wants to prove that there was a "one thing", so when they learned about his ethics, he said he didn't bother everyone.
The two-time Olympic Copper Medals have become the highest name for LGBT, and they use this figure to make it a crime for more Communal Games in Australia to avoid homosexuality for more countries.

Daley didn't accept his father's death, and one of the things he finally asked him was whether he wanted to be in front of him to have their tickets for London 2012.
He said, "I can't tell you that my father will not be with us to be a part of us."
He said, "I held my hand when the breath stopped, and I made sure that the breath did not last until it stood and died,"
In the following year, Daley won over the 2010 Olympic Copper.
"But I knew that this was my old age," he said, "but I knew that I'd never be able to get into the Olympic games before the public.
He moved his first choice of music-- Proud was joining with him in the small-olopic arrangement of Heather, and he still has a rumor on him.

Mickelson’s stand was changed to the Rider Cave race on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson puts honor in the 47th Ryder Cave competition, but to keep something unpleasant, he must change his position.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time in a two-year competition for honoring, was replaced by a four-party game on Saturday as a pair.
Rather than being as powerful as the United States, the winner of 5 times renewed his time and paid him two times to prepare his own for the game to relieve his anxiety.
Even those who have traveled to win do not come from the tomato of his player's time, and 48-year-old players are not suitable for the big Golf national playground, which is difficult for many and unconscious comforts.
And if the toy field is not enough to discourage itself, Mickelson's ninth game of Sunday will be joined by the strong British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who created four games to win.
The Americans who started the 12 plays at a 4-point low, if they didn't start a major attack, the Mickelson game could prove its vitality.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his own person, and I didn't talk much more.
"He is fully aware of the role now, and if he puts my back on my arm, he will prepare for tomorrow." Al Furyk.
"Have deep faith in him."
He's wonderful. He's added many things to the group in the past, and he's got it this week.
I didn't think I would like to add two games as an opportunity.
I thought so much, but we thought that this was the way we should go.
Like all of us, he wants to be this."
About a lot of Ryder's game, Nick Faldo passed through Mickelson's honor in the Sunday game.
Since we never enjoy the glory of the private, the play of the Ryder's cup game can show the end of the time.
Mickelson won 18 times, when he won 20 times, he went out seven times, but he brought to the group things that were impossible to see.
He said: "It's a laugh, it's a joke, it's a joke, and it's a great thing to find him in the group.
"The young players are relaxed at playing with him emotionally this week. It's sad to see him.
"He gives much more than a game."
The European ambassador Thomas Bjorn knows that many differences will soon be eliminated
The European ambassador Thomas Bjorn can turn into a journey that is not easily accessible when he arrives at the last day of the solitary radar game, just as he understands from his experience.
Danny made the first game for Valderama in 1997, at the time in Seve Ballesteros, a five-point excellence over the Americans, but he finally won the game with a small win, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Remember that we were steering your head wide over Valderama; if we were winning, we were leading the Brokeline far, and we were winning the little Valderama," Bjorn said, after seeing the 2018 graduates win the 5-3th Wednesday and the evenings, leading the national Le Golf, after he saw it.
Therefore the story shows us to me and to all the members of the group that this thing has not ceased.
Tomorrow you shall bring out your full strength.
Get out of here, and do all the right things.
The matter didn't end until you found their numbers on the table.
Nama Alana, and that's how you try to win the cup, and that's where you're focusing.
I talked to them all together. I focus on the 12 of our players on our side, but we also know that there are great players on the world side. "
Bjorn added: "I never used myself in this matter.
Let me not forget another day.
Tomorrow is a person's qualification, and it's a different thing to do.
When things go well, it's great to be with Hagar, but when you're alone, it's like a golf player.
This is the message that you must take to all players. Tomorrow, hold your best qualifications.
Now, you leave your partner to power, let's go and show him the best."
Apart from Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the four-point point in common, his colleague, Jim Furyk, expects the players to show him more personal qualifications than they did in common.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these major changes, and at last, when Europe lifted a "miracle in Medinah", it was a winner in Brookline.
I remember every word, says the speaker, when Ben Crenshaw responded to the question of how to gather players who move to the last day in 1999.
"Tomorrow, we have 12 major games, but as you have seen in Brookline, it's best for Medinah to remove that fast starter, as you saw Medinah.
When he walks on the same road, he puts pressure on only half a gauge.
We've organized our paths and put the people in the form we've heard, you know, we're trying to invent tomorrow's magic.'
Thomas was given to try to direct his answer poetry and Rory McIlroy was on high-risk, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter met other Europeans in the forefront.
"I went in this order with this charity because I thought it would cover the inside," Bjorn said on his single choice.
German’s new warship slowed down again
The German Navy force had to be applied in 2014 to replace the Armada’s cold warship, but as a result of corrupt systems and increased costs, it would not be until at least the next year, reports media in the country.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-square fleet ship commander entered Sera, extended until mid-2019, mentioning a military spokesman in the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship had to combine its naval power in 2004, but the difficult issue of naval destiny created a problem for the gulf project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, which the Navy ordered over the past 2007, will be replaced by Bremen's fast-armed armoured vessels.
It is known to have a helium, an anti-airplane and an anti-ship-driven device, and a certain stylth technology, such as a small radar, a red bulb, and sound signatures.
Other necessary pages include long repair time-- the new rapid warship must be able to fly up to two years from the harbor of the country's home.
However, after a series of delays, Germany has been allowed to deal with the overseas power of warships - when the service begins, they will be outdated, and the Die Zeit has pointed out.
The Wicked Defense F125 had been the head of the last month of the Armada, when the German Navy authorities returned to the shipyard in Hamburg, where they prevented the ship from using it.
This was the first time when the ship of the sea returned a building to the ship, which had been discovered.
The reason for the return is not known, and if the German media were to attack the war ship, they mentioned the crucial "software and Hardware corruption" that would make it unreasonable.
Uniquely important was the lack of software, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship could be shipwrecked by 120 sailors, and the old Bremen class needed half of the manpower needed.
The ship has been incredibly heavy, and this has reduced its efficiency and has limited its capacity to increase its power.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are twice as heavy as a ship used in the Germans in World War II.
On the side of the corrupt Hardway, the entire project is becoming a matter of concern, including the training of sailors.
It has been reported that from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
Problems surrounding the new rapid warship are especially important to reduce Germany's potential.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, German Parliament Protection Committee Commander, announced that the Navy is indeed "destroying well-known ships".
The authorities have stated that the matter has been increased on a regular basis, since old ships have ceased to work but no replacements are offered.
He said with sadness that no Baden-Wuerttemberg's fleet ships could mix its power.
National Invisible Hearing of Vital Birds in Mysterious Life
A new study of how lacebirds use the earth for their food.
The discovery is believed to hate new lightning in the character of the unique flymaker, and it commands future protection activities.
SCIENTISTS follow the usual and high-speed pipistrells and long-eared and long-brown bird Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
In general, the time period is spent in the main areas of the space where special tools are used to monitor the movement of the nightbird.
Using hand-holders, NHS workers and circular movable studies are conducted.
And the record of all voices shall make sure that the sound of the expert's analyzing of the sound of the bird shall be repeated, and what kind of species is doing.
A map of life and a report is prepared to create an image of the landscape that is explained for their craftsmen.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural protection counselor, hopes that the outcome will confirm the importance of laser birds and that they will promote the use of some species.
This information helps to identify the benefits of selecting forests, such as green farming and larvae and related species.
Over the past year, the number of lizards has decreased dramatically in Scotland and all UK.
They are in danger of the destruction of nests and machinations because of construction and development.
The wind and lightning can cause dangers, such as flying papers and certain construction chemicals, as well as the attack of lizards.
For surely the birds of the night are not blind.
But their ears are better than their eyes when they come to hunt their food because of their nightclubs.
They use a complex method of habitat to find the souls rightly, or to distinguish a barrier in the way they fly.
NTS, more than 270 historical buildings, 38 vital parks and 76,000 rugged land around the air, take seriously the fowls.
Every time there is a study, a pet check, and sometimes a rescue job, there are trained experts.
The organization has set up the first and the only one of the arrows of the arcs, a larvae shelter for the eight, even in the Dumfries and Galloway estates of Threave.
David Thompson, the governor of the land, said that his inheritance was an appropriate rulership for them.
"We have a good place in Treave for the nightbirds," he said.
We have old buildings, many of the trees are full of age, and all of them are good.
But there is much that we don't know about latrine birds, so it helps us to understand exactly what we do here and elsewhere to develop."
Before repairing property, he stressed the need to check the absence of nightbirds, and the unintentional destruction of a parent’s nest could eliminate up to 400 women and children, perhaps the general population.
Birds are beautiful, and killing, attacking, or disturbing them or destroying their nests is a crime.
Elisabeth Ferrell encouraged the protection of the Scottish Lillite bird, like my own officer, to come to help his people.
As she said, "I don't know how much we have to learn about our larvae, and how many of our species are to be numbered."
When the lawyer prepared to accuse the German magazine, Ronaldo forcibly ignored the crime
Cristiano Ronaldo said that his rape against him was “false news, ” saying that people use his name as“ they want to make themselves known. ”
The lawyers are prepared to accuse the German newsletter Der Spiegel.
An American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, was accused of being raped at Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
It was said that it was worth 375,000 dollars to keep quiet about the harlot. Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
From time to time, in the Instagram, he reported to 142 million of his followers, directly speaking videos, Ronaldo, 33, as "False News".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Today, false news, "Ballon d'Or five times spoke in Cameroon.
"They want to make themselves known by using my name.
Normal
They want to be known by calling my name, but this is the body of the work.
"I'm a happy man, and it's all good," the players smiled.
According to the Reuters, “in the case of Ronaldo's attorneys, which they call unreceptive gamblers on personal freedom, they are being prepared to accuse Der Spiegel”
Christian Schertz said: "What does the players have to do with the agreement, but recently the most serious person's rights have been violated, and the loss of the morals is the cause of the damage."
The case occurred in June 2009 in the Hotel section of Palms and Las Vegas Casino
The Nevada District Court of Clarke County reports that if they met on the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were led to the so - called brave section of the Nevada District Court
Ronaldo was in charge of the case, kneeling 99 Percent is a "good man" and saying that "1 Percent" fell in Mayorga.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex and that they had been harmonious
Mayorga also explained that she went with the police and had photographs of her damage in the hospital but finally agreed outside the court, "were afraid of vengeance" and "we should not be humiliated"
34-year-old confronted us with the complaint, so she continues to be troubled and wants to break the agreement.
When the attack was reported to have taken place at the end of Manchester U.S. Real Madrid, and in this debate, Juve was transferred to the Italian giants by €100 million
Brexit (Britain's exit from the European Union): UK can't' regret her forever's loss of her car manufacturers.
If the Brexit is a world leader, the UK can't be "forgived forever", says the business office, "Greg Clark,"
Toyota UK added that if Britain disagreed with the EU's exit, Burnaston's factory would stop the production for a while, BBC would have been "concerned"
"We Want Conflict," said Aunt Clark.
As the Japanese car manufacturers say, the unconscious timing of the Brexit border may have an impact on the job loss
Toyota's Auris and Avensis produced by the Burnaston factory last month, 150000 cars were sent to the engraved European Union
"In my view, Britain will stop the product from the EU at the end of April in our factory" in Burnaston, director of the Toyota Administration, Marvin Cook
Other UK manufacturers have feared how unanimity of EU trade would be threatened, including Hondan, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, following the brochure Oxford’s small factory for the month
According to car manufacturers, the most important risk of unconsciousness is the supply chain
Toyota product line is based on "just-in-time", and therefore the orderly cars are approached from the UK and the EU every 37 minutes
On April 29, the U.K. unconsciousness can lead to a border breach, resulting in delays and reductions of goods, says the industry
In the Derbyshire factory, the company said that holding to Toyota was impossible, and that the production could have stopped
On future contact with the EU, the Thersa May government plan “is to be correctly integrated to remove border searches, ” says Atto Clark
"We need harmony," said BBC 4 today.
"We want to continue the most effective supply chain, as it is possible not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will stop, but the cost of increasing has warned that it can reduce the competitiveness of the factory and its potential.
In Burnaston, a 24-month worker who said that Peter Tsouvalaris, the U.S. Society in the factory, was very concerned about his members: "If these tasks go away, they will never return.
The Kingdom's spokesperson said: "We have made a sound and reliable plan on our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting is possible again, says White House
According to Sunday Lt White House, Donald Trump, the great benefit of the law prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the meeting can be held for another week, because Bret Kavanaugh, the procurator of the Supreme Court, continues to fight.
Rosenstein's choice of the Russian intervention, the Trump's relationship and the President's justice scandal, and the work of the President Robert Mueller, who examines the justice of the president.
To put Mueller's freedom in danger, the vice-president Trump has not expelled it and has not expelled it, the news has spread to Washington for months.
In the beginning of this month, Rosenstein, when he was conversing with Trump, read about what he had done to draw up their news and that he was able to remove the president at the 25th amendment box, New York Times.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he reported that he was going to leave the White House in the middle.
Instead, it is known that there will be a meeting on Thursday with Trump in the United Nations in New York.
Trump Rosenstein said that he would be "supported" but that the meeting was delayed to avoid the quarrel with members of the council, which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual harassment.
In view of Kavanaugh's question, Wednesday has ordered a week's inspection of the FBI, and all members of the decision-making council must participate in the delay.
The director of the Trump Information Office, Sarah Sanders, presented the Sunday Fox News.
He asked about the Rosenstein meeting, and said, "It's not a good day for him, perhaps this week, it is possible to move to another week, as if there were things going on in the High Court.
But we see, and I want to tell the media always when there is something new."
Some reporters may test this assurance: Sanders did not deliver a press release from September 10 by the White House.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of "Sabi" descriptions was not hated by TV journalists, but she said, "I agree with them."
And she gave a straightforward comment between this Trump and the media.
Without any confirmation, she added: "We have seen these numbers," saying, "The president has died for a lot of questions and answers than any of the presidents before him."
Says Sanders, "If the media have the chance to ask questions directly to the presidents of the United States, that is more than talking to me.
We've been trying so hard to do that, and you've seen us doing so very much for the past few weeks, and when you can speak to the president of the United States, that press release will be one person."
Trump always accepts questions when he participates in the White House or in open meetings or when he leaves with great guests in the public congregation.
There are only a few press releases.
This week, the president of New York will see what he has to do.

And I know that they shall cry unto thee in a very unsteady time for every one.
For this reason, I would like to say again and again how much I have to place on my part the contribution of each of the members of the work without their own nationality.
From all over the EU, over and above, they have brought valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, and have developed the patient and the community.
Scotland is your home and we want them to stay very long."

Corbyn’s quest to attract young selectors reduces success
The seal obligation will be placed on those who do not pay UK taxes
To help the homeless, the pounds of $120 million a year are reserved
Foreign government officials were ordered to pay a high sealing obligation when buying UK property - the addition is used to help homeless people, and Theresa May is known today.
The activity is seen as attempting to reduce the success of attracting young prospectives by entering and combining high-income households that have a high level of capacity.
The printer's obligation will be increased on individuals and organizations who do not pay UK taxes, and the money will help to fight on the Kingdom street.
In addition to the current seal obligation, it may be two years ago, including the high levels known to the second houses and the purchase-scan-kiri -- up to 3 persent.
The money warehouse is up to 120 million pounds [$120 million].
To 13 Pearcent London new built houses have been purchased by UK-owners, rising prices, and for the first time the rulers make it difficult to put their feet on the ladder.

The new directive came from Boris Johnson in charge of the two weeks when many young residents had to revoke the Temple's duty to have their own home.
He held them accountable for the fact that they had not received large building sites and had not used them, and he urged them to leave behind a part of the British "hazardous house rebuilding system".
Author Corbyn Iin introduced a series of planned housing improvements, including rental control and "destructable".
He wants to give the council great authority to build new houses.
"The last year, I thought I'd put out my prime minister to restore the British dream -- that life must be better for all generations.
And it is the repair of our broken house market.
Britain will be open to those who want to live, establish, and live a new life.
However, it is not true that it is easy to buy homes for other national organizations, such as strong British workers, U.S. non-U.
For many people, homeownership has been so far away, and the reality of the honorable street sleeping continues. ”
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to rule Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said, is to be a trainer of Scotland at the level of his "last wish."
Scot, 42, is now enjoying the struggle to sow life again from the one League above, the North-Easter group downstairs at the bottom of the top.
In the last days of the race, St. Merren was moved in this summer to the light stadium from returning to the Scottish Premiership.
I want to play for my own country, as a player.
I've got a B cup over," Ross to BBC Scotland's voice.
When I was a child, I grew up with my father, seeing Scotland so much in Hampden, and always listening to me.
This is possible if I succeed in managing a group.
Ross agents such as Dick Advocaat Training Sunderland, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Atletic was told that the name of Barnsley and Ipswich, which had been built following the martyrdom of Barnsley and Ipswich, would not cause anxiety in such a large group.
He says, "Can I return this group to Premier League this hour?"
The structure and presentation of this group is unquestionably based on the Premier League.
"To do this is not a simple task, but only if I can return to this group that I see as a success. "
Ross has been trained in Dumbarton and has been in charge of the Hearts' training course for only three months.
From this Alloah has revived alloa from the downstream to the third level, and St. Mirren has transformed them from the downstream to the ranks of victory in the next time of the contest.
And Ross said that the work of the Clade, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton's Academic Games was now very good.
"I wish it was the right pass," remembering what happened to Alloah.
I don't want to play, but I'm just saying, "Train is the right thing for me."
It seems strange because I am old enough, I have built a reasonable life, and I have attained certain reasonable heights.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things that you have to pass every week.
I'm overwhelmed again by the stress and pressure of the work.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm working, and I've been feeling very good about my old age myself."

Alcohol - sales teams showed 2.7 percent sales in Julia, but food earnings were below 4.8 percent, as the numbers showed
“The next sunlight and England's long-standing world cup is that Julie followed the same recurring events as the previous June, ” says Peter Martín, who gathered the numbers.
In June, food homes trade caused 1.8 percent collapse in Julie
Drinking bars and drinking houses have shown greater growth than those that have fallen in the dining rooms.
But they have been severely damaged, although it is not as shocking as the food movements.
It seems that people only want to drink.
It was 6.6 percent higher for a month in well-contaminated drinking and alcohol sales, and a three-quarter meal was lower."
The use of time for entertainment and the reception of guest friends, R.A. Paul Newman, said: “These results continue as we have seen at the end of April.
Air and major social or sportive impacts will remain extremely powerful when they come to outsourcing sales.
It is not surprising that food groups continue to fight, but that 4.8 percent of the year's sales have been reduced, especially worse, than the price pressure.
The long, hot summers could not have come in the worst time of the merchandise trade, and it tells us that the more moderate temperatures we spent in August give us a little needed relief."
The total sales growth in July was 2.7 percent, including the new openings, reflecting the process of resuming new services
The Yuckey drink sale, the alcohol sale, and the food market controller, the Cooper Pitch, if the sum of information is £9 billion, then 47 commercial movement groups will collect and resemble us, and the founded industry symbolizes it.

The advertisement of the breast milk instrument, which compares mothers to cows, divides the comments on the Internet
The advertisement of a breast - milk weapon that compares the company to cows that rub on the Internet
Regarding the start of the so-called "Sweets of Milky Way in the First Day of the Day", the Webster's Technology Dr. Elvey Elvey Elaigna made an announcement that shows the freedom of mothers expressing themselves.
When four right mothers play a single music, which includes such a lyric, they dance in a crocodile, "Yes, but you don't see my head," and "if you don't understand it well, these are not cologne, but I don't know it."
He continues: "Put him out, I'm feeding my babes, I'm feeding him, I'm feeding him, I'm feeding him.
However, an announcement published on the Facebook page of the organization has raised contentions on the Internet.
In 77,000 viewings and hundreds of messages, the video has been received, and many have developed the industry’s “stupids”
"Using cows to make known this product is a very recent decision.
Just like us, they should be pregnant and born to give milk, except for the child's being stolen in a few days."
Elivie’s milk can be kept in his nurse’s luggage (Elvi/Mom)
Another comment said: "It is disturbing to both mothers and children in a way that they can understand.
But why don't we use them to introduce milk to mothers who should take care of their babies?
Another man added: "An announcement of a time that has little knowledge like this."
Others defended the advertisement, believing that a single woman found the song "very funny"
"This seems to me to be a great fantasy.
If I had one, I had been breast - feeding
Drinking made me feel like a cow.
I took what I wanted to say, the announcement is to some extent insensitive.
This is a great product."
Another commented: "This canal is an ad that is often used (workplaces or toilets) and a stunning announcement that is made by mothers who feel like " cows".
This is not an announcement that promotes the industry or claims that it is bad."
At the end of the video, the women's team announced that they were all dancing at the bottom of a bacon.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who use the breastplate say that we feel like cows.
However, Elvie has no full voice, no cords or drums, and no known breastplate, it will keep it under her care, move women, use their babies and use the watercourse to get out.
Anna Balarín, the architectural and Icidi commented: "Elvie is a revolutionary product, and he deserves a brave and angry starter.
We wanted to put the breasts in a line between the women and the dairy cows, and to focus on the community of all the wrongs, and to show clearly the unreliable freedom that the new shelter will bring in a relaxed and convenient way

Sipove, 30, on the lowest Manhattan, on the Western Fast Cyclone Road, at October, he carried out a rental car, which damaged the drivers on the road, as well as the legs.
On the basis of the death notice in the southern part of New York, the death sentence must be granted, researchers must make sure that Seppuv intended to cause serious damage to the body.
Both cases have the power to rule death on the basis of the court's document.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court filed a 22-foot case against Sepopov in a commonly organized crime, the murder of human life, and the violation and damage of motor vehicles.
According to the researcher, the attack “supports long-term planning and preparation”, and this is said to describe Sapiove as“seriously cruel and fragile. ”
The case document states: "Sifulo Habiblaevik Sipov of Diago Enrique Angeli, Nicholas Clives, Heran Ferruci, Heran Diago Mendoza, and Alejandro Damia Pagunko's families and friends have been killed, damaged. "
The five casualties came to him from Argentina.

The SIPW panel's lawyers had asked him not to ask for the death penalty.

This Is the Badest Language of Foolishness
President Trump did not mock at the Senator Diane Panther, and he did not release his letter from the Christine Blessing Ford on Saturday's political community meeting, and he was accused of having sexual assault on Bright Kavanah.
In the speech of West Virginia, the president did not give a witness to the Ford address in West Virginia, so that you could say, "Average, irreprehensible and unbelievable"
