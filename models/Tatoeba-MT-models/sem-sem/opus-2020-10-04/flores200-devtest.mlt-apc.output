Under them there are more cats of medium size eating the medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antilopis and earrings.
Lastly, there are many cats small (including cats that are pet animals free) who eat a small prey that is much more numerous than insects, rodents, twinkles, and birds.
The secret for their success is the concept of a ceremony, a special task that each cat has and that it does not allow him to compete with others.

When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they have come (such as moving across mountains or rivers, or moving to a new island so that they can't move back easily) they often find themselves in an environment different from what they used to.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they previously needed.
The original population has not changed anything, but they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as soon as the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.

For example, the most common form of photography of fixed images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size of the film at the closing of the age of the analogue film.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, the proportion of its aspect is derived from the sensory formats of images of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is currently, in some way confused, 36 mm wide with a 24 mm height.
The proportion of the aspect of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the most simple proportion of a simple number) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, family of APS formats) are equal to this ratio of the aspect, or very similar to it.

● The technological definition is a term that contains a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological push or imperative technology to a rigid sense that the human destiny is driven by a logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.

While learning based on projects should make learning easier and more interesting, the method of learning called scafffolding is more effective.
The scaffolding is not a teaching method but, rather, help to provide support to individuals undergoing new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer programme or the start of a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scafffold but even the small man of the paper clip in the Microsoft Office is scafffold.
The Virtual Scaffolding is internalised in the software and aims at asking, accelerating, and explaining the procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage them alone.
Children are placed in pastor care for a wide variety of reasons that involve negligence, abuse, and even extraction.
● No children should ever have to grow up in an environment other than fostering, treating, and educating, but this is still true.
We consider the Phostering Treatment System to be a safety area for these children.
Our caregiver system should provide safe homes, نظار who offer their love, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care should provide all the needs that were missing in the house previously taken from them.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are suggested as motivations important for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
• "Involvement personal" and "continuous relations" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eahmey and McCord (1998) when investigating the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, the movements of the surface that last a little byisecondi.
Particularly, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his document “The President's Speech”, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand the speech because of a brain damage are, however, able to assess the honesty accurately.
It even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behaviour exist also in animals like pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation increases a new genetic variability, and the option is to remove it from the express set of variations.
Segregation and recombination combine the variation between the two groups with each generation.
In the Savannah, it is difficult to take precedence with a human-like digestive system to meet the needs of its amino acid from the resources of the plants available.
In addition, the failure to do so has serious consequences: decreased growth, malnutrition, وأخيرا الموت.
"The most easily accessible plant resources were proteins accessible in the leaves and legums, but they are difficult for primates like us to dictate until they are not cooked.
By contrast, animal food (nemel, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Given كل شيء, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" almost as much as they do today the cimpans living in the savannah.
The interruption of sleep is the process of getting up apposta during the normal period of your sleep and sleeping a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using فضح الهدوء النسبي الذي يجعلك تشعر بالراحة دون ان يوقظك كليا.
If you find yourself restructuring ساعة أثناء نومك ، يمكنك وضعه على الجانب الآخر من الغرفة ، مما يجعلك تخرج من السرير لتزيله .
Other alternatives based on bioritmetics involve drinking many fluids (particularly water or tea, a diuretic popular) prior to sleep, thus making the person rise to urinary.
The amount of peace الداخلي a person has is corroborated in contrast with the amount of stress in the body and the spirit of the person.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life present, the more everyone has the potential to find peace and السعادة المطلقة.
The only obstacle to this is our own stress and negligence.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded by the love of Mahayana and many techniques by Juga Indiana.
As a principle, Buddhism Tibetan is very simple, it consists of Yoga Condalini, meditation, and the idea that love accepts everything.
Through Joga of Condalini, the energy of Condalini (light energy) is raised through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations.
There is yoga of the gods at the heart of the Tibetan meditation, through the visualisation of various gods, which cleans the power channels, activates the chakras and creates a conscience of lighting.
At the end of the war, inconsistencies in the system, the process and culture led to fighting in the countries.

By 17 September 1939, دفاع بولندا had already been split, and the only hope was to retire and reorganize itself along the Roman bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete almost from day to day, when more than 800,000 جندي من Army Red Union of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronti of Belarus and أوكرانيا after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Soviet-Pollakk Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Logically, the use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and objects to cross the oceans.
Traditionally, naval work was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move your people and objects, while at the same time, to interfere with your enemy's ability to move people and objects.
One of the most recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to move men and materials across المحيط الأطلسي to help the Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain just as it did to باقي Europe.
It turns out that the goats were first housed some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
● بدأ الحضارات والقبائل القديمة في الاحتفاظ بها لتسهيل الحصول على الحليب، الصوف، اللحم، والجلود.
The domestic goats were generally held in herds that grazed with hills or other areas of pasture, often attended by shepherds of goats who were often children or adolescents, similar to shepherds of sheep more known.
Wagonways were built in England early in the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of planks paralleli of wood, they allowed the horses to draw them to get bigger speeds and to attract loads greater than on the streets a little more refrigerant of that time.

This has become a practice common, but iron has caused more strap on the wheels of wood carts.
In fact, wheels of wood were replaced by wheels of iron; in 1767, the first lines of iron were introduced completely.
The first known means of transport was walking, and humans began walking with standing two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning a man standing).
The Australopithecus, their predecessors, were not walking with standing habitually.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Austrialopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on foot even from seven million years ago.

ومع ذلك, if we do not want a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems, and we must disable them.
ومن الواضح بما فيه الكفاية that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have become greater because of the excess population and the way of life that is so stricken by mankind.
After his adoption by the Congress on 4 July, the draft was written handwritten and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson were then sent a few blocks away into the John Dunlap’s printery store.
During the night, they were made between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "the Dunlap widesides".
The first public reading of the document was held by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
وأُرسلت واحدة إلى جورج واشنطن في 6 تموز/يوليه، الذي أمر بقراءة قواته في نيويورك في 9 تموز/يوليه.
The 25 widesides Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest copies that have survived the document. The original copy written by hands has ceased to exist.
Many paleontologists اليوم believe that a single group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with the shells and nails with the tip, they lay eggs, and walk on their rear feet like T-Rex.
Practically all the computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is codified in the form of numbers binary.
The binary number may have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these are called binary figures - or bits, in the language of the computer.

About the United States of America, there are some 400,000 cases known of multiple sclerosis (MS), which make it the main nerrologic disease in young and medium-age adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and the nerv optic.
Research has found that women are twice more likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make a plan of adoption for their baby.

Many rifts observed in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic indications, have been documented for most of the living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
● The biological clocks are oxxillators who claim to be the ones who will continue a period of cycleism of free pursuits even without indications externally.
The experiment of Hershie and Chase was one of the key suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to bring their own DNA into bacterial.
They did two experiments by marking DNA or DNA in the bacterial phosphorus radioactive or bacterial phosphorus protein with sulphur radioactive.
The mutations may have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are cells of the microbial line.
There are only mutations in the cells of the microbis line that can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause death of cells or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts interested people to visit areas of nature to enjoy the landscape, including النباتات والحيوانات البرية.
Examples of activities on the ground include hunting, fishing, photography, observation of birds, and visits to parks and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example of this is to visit, take photos, and learn about the orangutans in Burnéo.
Every morning, people leave البلد’s small towns with cars to go to work and pass by other people whose workplace is their place of departure.
In this dynamic crust of transport, everyone, in some way, is linked to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participate in society and use transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In the developed countries, نادرا ما تسمع similar levels of murmuring about the quality of water or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems create such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interactions between each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with certainty of 100%.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a range reasonablely consistent; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented by approximately mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density, and (3) the speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to start flying وقدرتهم على الطيران ساعدتهم على تجنب العدو بطريقة أسهل وإيجاد الطعام والشركاء بكفاءة أكبر.
For most insects, there is the advantage of being able to extend اجنحتهم مرة أخرى في مكانها طوال اجسادهم.
This gives them a wider range of places small to hide from the predators.
Today, the only insects that can't restate their wings are the mouse and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarcus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people ظنوا أنه كان محقاً ولكن الكثير من الناس آمنوا بالعكس؛ أن النظام الشمسي سار حول العالم, بما في ذلك الشمس (and حتى النجوم الأخرى).
This sounds sensible, since the world does not feel like moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second and largest river in the world, carrying it more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points having a width of six miles.
Altogether, 20 per cent of all water flowing from rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from Amazon.
The main Amazone River is 6,387 km (3,980 km), which gathers water from thousands of rivers smaller.
Although the building of pyramids with stones continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, Giza’s pyramids remained the largest in size and best in the technical excellence of their construction.

All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have long known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, since they can all be discovered in nature in indigenous form and it is relatively simple to dig them in mining through primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything consisted of a combination of one or more four elements: land, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of the matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
● The alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have a alloy containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.

Generally, there may be two kinds of attitudes when managers start to manage those who formerly were their associates.
This type of manager finds it difficult to take decisions unpopular, to take action تأديبية, to carry out evaluations, to assign responsibilities, and to ensure that people are responsible.
In the other side of the spectrum, one is transformed into an individual who is not aware that he feels that he should change every one made the team and mark it as his.
After all, the head is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates discords between leaders and بقية الفريق.
virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as those conventional groups, but there are some differences subtle.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional team since their teams can meet according to different areas of time and may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a true “tim inviżibbli” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "unseen team" is the management team to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why does an organisation want to go through the process that takes so much time to set up an organisation to learn? One of the purposes of realizing in practice the concepts of an organisation to learn is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, they may emerge from creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, the process of working together of an organisation to overcome an obstacle could lead to a new innovative process that satisfies the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as a shared knowledge and an organisational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the approach of the Continuous Sequence as a method being used to help organisations reach a higher level of performance.
Data on neurobiologists gives physical proof of the theoretical approach to investigation of cosmetics, so this makes research less extensive and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between pathology of the brain and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
For a long time, it was known that various kinds of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides much information and material for building simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our minds.
Although the Artist Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of imagination of science, the AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with behaviour, learning and smart adaptation in an engine.
Research on IA involves creating machines that authorize tasks that require smart behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and timing, ability to answer diagnosis and customers' questions, as well as recognition of calculography, voice and face.
Such things have become disciples separately, who focus on finding solutions to problems in real life.
The IA system is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military, as built in several applications of computer software in homes and videos.
Often, teachers like to take her students to places where there's no possibility of going with the bus.
The technology offers the solution with virtual journeys on the ground. Students can look at artifacts of museums, visit aquatics, or admire beautiful arts while sitting with their classroom.
● Sharing travel on the spot with others virtually is also a good way to reflect on travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, annually, students from School Bennet in North Carolina designing a website on their journey to the Capital of State, each year is replaced by a new website, but the old versions are kept online to serve as scriptbook.
Although تلاميذ often يبدأون تجاربهم في المدونات مع سوء grammatical and orthography, having a audience usually results in a change in this situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to work to improve the writing so as not to be criticized.
Also the blogging "causes students to learn more about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest moves students to be more relevant and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that entitles students to cooperate, urging them to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs " can give students the power to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to Internet materials, students will be able to define their positions in the context of writings of others and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).

Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Near East of Rwanda.
By 2002, Goma was destroyed with a lava by the Nyragongo volcano that defended the majority of the streets of the city, in particular the center of the city.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to know the state of the fighting that still persists in the northern province of Kivu.
The city is also the basis for interconnecting with the Nyragongo volcano together with some of the cheapest trekking of Gorilla Mountains in Africa.
You can use the Bodaboda (motor taksi) to turn into Goma. The normal price (local) is ~500 Frank Kongoliz for a short turn.

The National Kruger Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and crosses the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Cocodile River ("Crocodile River").
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-area, each containing various wildlife.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the example of the South African National Parks (SANPARks).
As with all South Africa National Parks, daily fees are applied for the conservation and entry into the park.
It may also be beneficial to buy wild card, providing income or for elections to parks in South Africa or for all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong ("Hong Kong Island") gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place where many tourists regard it as the main focus.
The deployment of buildings forming the squids of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar lightly glittered bar due to the presence of the waters of the port of Victoria.
To have Hong Kong's best viewers, leave the island and go to Coollon's waterfront on the other side.
The majority of the urban development part of the island of Hong Kong is packed in a densely densified way on a land announced on the north coast.
This is the place which British colonists took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
ê Sundarbans are the largest forest of mangrove littoral in the world, which is 80 km (50 km) long from the coast to the inside of Bangladesh and India.
The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called the National Park of the Sundarbans.
● Forests are not just trains in lands wet — they include some of the last remaining positions of the impersonal forests that once covered the Gangetic Hemisphere.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/blown areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans have been a sanctuary of wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 berries of the Royal Bengal and about 30,000 turtles with ticks in the area.
The buses leave the bus station between the districts (along the river) during the day, although many of them, especially those heading to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.

The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when expected to be completed by the Brazilian customs control points.
The Guaranís were the most significant indigenous group to live in what is today East Paraguay, who lived as semi-nomadists who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "the Great Province of the Industries", was born as a result of a meeting of Spanish victors with the indigenous groups.
Happily, the Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since تأسيس Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.

The official currency of Falklands is the Falklandese lira (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of British lira (GBP).
The money can be exchanged in the only bank in the islands located in Stanley by the FIC West Stock.
The British liri will generally be accepted everywhere in the islands and in Stanley credit cards and the American dollars are also widely accepted.
On the outsourcing islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although they may be accepted in English and US currency; speak to the owners in advance to see what is a method of payment acceptable.
Almost impossible to change the currency of Falklands outside the islands, so exchanged the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies in the south of the Equator, there will be summer when the winter and vice versa will be in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is found in subtropicals; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter may be cold in a way that is misleading: temperatures rarely fall below the freezer, but the wind and moisture come together to feel colder than those that indicate the thermometer.
There are no particular seasons "with rain" and "dry": the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
