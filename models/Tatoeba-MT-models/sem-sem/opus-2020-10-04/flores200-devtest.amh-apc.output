For the next 40 years, there were some of them from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other warfields in the same war.
Poland’s defense was broken on September 17, 1939, although the only one with hope was to shrink back and reorganize it with the Roman position of war.

Every person involved participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone offers resentment for travel systems.
In the developed countries, some sometimes hear similar complaints about water quality and the fall of bridges.
Why do transport systems bring such resentment, why do they fail each day, and why do they fail to succeed? Does this mean that transport engineers are not qualified enough? Or is something more fundamental being done?
It is a study of the activity of drivers and drivers and their relationships with each other between two points of the traffic flow.
It is difficult to study traffic flow because it is not possible to predict with certainty 100 percent of the driver’s personality, as if he were not being harassed.
Fortunately, drivers display behaviour in the area where traffic flows are appropriate: therefore, they have a certain degree of consistency, and they can be represented by imagination by mathematics.
In order to better represent traffic flow, contacts have been established among the three main features, (1) flow, (2) step, and (3) speed.
Such contacts help to plan road transport, diesel, and work.
These insects were the first animals to fly into the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies easily, to obtain food and to obtain a suitable mate.
