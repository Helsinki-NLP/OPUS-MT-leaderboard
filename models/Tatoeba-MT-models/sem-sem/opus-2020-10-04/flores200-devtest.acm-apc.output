Technological inevitability is a term that includes a wide range of ideas by practice, from moving technology or technological necessity to feeling rigid that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and manifestations of technology.
Two general ideas, which share most of the explanations of technological inevitability: that the development of technology itself follows a course far beyond the cultural or political impact, and that technology, in turn, is a god of “influences” on rooted societies, instead of those associated with society.
For example, one might say that the engine of the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Yet, the creation of a network of roads throughout the country, which is considered to be economically useful for a few automobiles, is therefore being developed in new ways to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
Pooling of cars also causes high rate of road accidents, and halshi leads to new techniques of health care for the treatment of damaged bodies.
Romance had a major element of cultural inevitability taken from a book, such as Jote, Fitt, and Schligh.
