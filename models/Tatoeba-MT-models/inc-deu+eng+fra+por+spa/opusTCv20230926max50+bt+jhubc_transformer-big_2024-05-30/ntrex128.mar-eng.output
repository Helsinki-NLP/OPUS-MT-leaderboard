Welsh am not worried about 'looking like mampets'
Some are doubtful about the suggestion of changing their title to MWP (Member of Welsh Parliament).
The decision to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament has raised doubts.
I am concerned that this change will not be visible from various political parties.
A worker AM said his group was concerned that the title "looks like Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: twp in Welsh means fool and pwp means feces.
One of the players said the entire team was "disappointed" and suggested options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but said MWP-Mupet was a minor literal torture.
In this context, the Welsh word for welsh is pronounced as Yorkshire English u.
The Assemblies Commission, which is currently drafting a law to initiate a change in the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what to name the members of the Assembly will, of course, depend on the members."
The Welsh Assembly has been empowered by the Welsh Government Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published public consultation findings on the proposals, which found widespread support for the Assembly to designate a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of AM's title, the Commission did not favour a Welsh Parliamentarian or WMP, but, the MWP option received the highest support in public consultation.
AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes in a few weeks.
The Act on Reforms will include other changes in the working of the Assembly, including the rules on disqualification of AMs and the structure of the Committee Arrangement.
When I am discussing this law, I will take a final vote on the question of which name to address them.
Macedonians will vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum is aimed at resolving decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, a province of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is equivalent to representing their territory and that the EU and NATO members have consistently objected to its efforts to give it.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, is an opponent of the referendum on the name change.
But, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zhaev, supporters of the referendum claim that the change in the name is only the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells pacified as churches clash in Harlem
"From a historical point of view, the older people I've spoken to, I think there was a time and a discussion on every corner," Adams said.
"There is nothing today."
He said that the bars have become invisible.
“People come together in different ways today,” he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go on a regular basis."
In the case of churches, they are concerned that the money coming from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to the place of origin."
He further said that in place of churches, apartment buildings could come in, there would be condominiums filled with people who did not help the remaining shelters in the neighbourhood.
"The majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the time for the complete closure of these churches will come soon because most people who live in these condominiums are unlikely to be members of these churches."
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin’s, the metropolitan community – both churches were built by groups of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis.
The original group of white Methodists came out in the 1930s.
The building was owned by a group of black people who were praying nearby.
The group of blacks took control of St. Martin, led by Rev. John Howard, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, was the main road to shopping in Harlem, and opposed the hiring or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parents planned to rebuild it, starting with Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the hour of the poor."
In July, Carillon's lawyers called him another way: "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carillon played by the black, Dionisio A. Lind, who debuted in a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariweder submits that St. Martin did not substitute him.
What happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, brought to some extent by church leaders, and the rest by episcopal dialysis.
The vestry – the Parish board of directors, made up of general leaders – expressed concern in July when they wrote the dialysis that this dialysis would try to hand over a "case of cost" to the vestry, although the architects and contractors sent by the dialysis were not involved in the hiring.
Some residents complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the dyslexic.
A 13-year-old boy was injured on a lobster drive in California.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while battling for a lobster on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at around 7 am on the banks of Bikanes in Ansinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that when he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, he heard a boy screaming for help and with a bat, he went to him and helped him get out of the water.
Hamley said that at first she felt a joke about catching a lobster, but then she found out that he was crying, taking my tea!
I've got my cup!"
"He's got his whole body in his hands," the boy said as he pulled out the gun.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hamley said.
The boy was taken to the Reed Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack could not be ascertained.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
The boy sustained serious injuries on the upper part of his body.
The authorities closed access to the seabed from Panto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Asinitas for 48 hours due to checks and security.
Gillespie noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not endangered.
The company plans to enter the UK's cosmetics market.
The Sensbury Department of Store-Method Beauty Eyes is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams through the appointment of expert assistants.
As part of the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn cosmetics market, as fashion and homeware sales continue to decline, more large beauty islands will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if successful, will be taken to more stores next year.
Cosmetics investments are coming in while supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space used by TVs, microwaves, and homewares.
Sensberry said that the number of its cosmetics will be doubled to 3,000, which will include brands like Revlon, ESS, Twisserman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space in branded parts found in stores such as boots.
This supermarket is also resuming its boutique makeup range so that most of the products will be vegetarian friendly – there is a growing demand for this from younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be offering discounts at two SenseBridge stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon in South London last week, and the second later this year, Sally Oak will open in Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and buying small quantities of food in local convenience stores every day means that supermarkets have to do a lot to attract people to you.
Sensbery's Chief Executive, Mike Kupp, said that these sales centers will increasingly look like department stores, while supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl are trying to compete with dealers through more services and non-food items.
Sensbury is building Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and since they bought these two chains two years ago, they have also launched several habeatts, which, according to them, have succeeded in increasing grocery sales, making these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt to reshape our beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sensberry tested a joint venture with Boots in 2000, but the partnership came after a dispute over how to distribute income from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.
The new policy came into effect three years after Sensbury sold its 281-storey pharmacy business, Celestio, to the owners of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
He said Lloyds will play a role in the scheme by incorporating a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Pose and Vichy, among the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sensbury, Commercial Director, says: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty oils to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be willing to give advice.
The range of our brands is tailored to every need and we are one of the attractive beauty spots challenging the old shopping method because of the attractive environment and convenient places."
'Peter Jones' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her life-style brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV after Dragons Den Star Peter Jones 'blows up'.
Willoughby doesn’t really have time for your homeware and accessories brand.
This business is compared to the Pilgrim's Groove brand in Guayana.
The morning presenter, 37, said on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has stepped out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute and slammed Dragons Dane star Peter Jones – and focused on her new grand contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones "flamed" when this popular TV girl admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to pay attention to her homeware and accessories brand Truely.
The business is compared to Paltrow's Gump brand in Guayana, which is estimated to double Biloby's wealth to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, announced that he was actually leaving from Instagram, Jones got out of the UK by a jet and left for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly has been at the top of Holly's priority list so far.
This would have been her long-term future which would have been successful over the next couple of decades.
Everyone was surprised by her decision to leave.
No one could have guessed what was going on on Tuesday.
There is a warehouse full of items at Marlow Headquarters that is ready to sell."
According to experts, one of the UK's most trusted stars, the exit of Thessalonica, the huge investment in a variety of products from cushions to candles and clothing to homewares, will cost the firm millions, and its launch is likely to be delayed even more.
This could be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin, who are mothers of three children, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cape for the past ten years.
Truly was founded in 2016 with Willoughby Cape and Jones and joined the 52-year-old Jones as president in March.
The couple spends the holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant-McPartlin as the host of ITV's IIM-A celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not going to comment on these business developments."
We fell in love and then we fell in love
Some critics have called the president's speech "unprofessional" and criticised him for being so optimistic about North Korea's presidency.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
Mr. Trump described his style as "news anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is looking forward to a second meeting after Trump praised the initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards disarmament of North Korea.
Disarmament negotiations, however, have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong, told the UN world leaders at the General Assembly on Saturday that the moves to quickly disarm North Korea do not seem to yield an “ad hoc response” from the United States.
Instead, he said the U.S. continues to impose sanctions.
Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are very good," he said.
"We're going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
"Now we have a great game."
Our efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - rocket tests have stopped, relief efforts are being made and the rest of the US personnel are returning home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space, it's better to have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing a little finger at the crowd standing in front of him.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Earthquake Ruined an Island, Hundreds of People Killed
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, he made it very clear that we are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," said Sumbang.
While Save the Children is forming a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work directly at the venue.
National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) spokesperson Mr Sutopo said that Indonesian authorities are studying the situation in Palu to see if foreign entities can be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Due to the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country is less prepared to deal with the impact of nature.
Although Tsunami deterrents have been built in Aceh, they are not easily found on other coasts.
Although a warning has been issued earlier, it is likely that the loss of life may have been caused due to the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu.
It is very difficult to travel to many islands.
Natural disasters make it even more difficult to do relief work.
A hospital ship set up to treat earthquake victims in Lombok is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's depleted infrastructure, and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, due to financial constraints, Mr Joko's administration is facing the challenge of re-election next year.
There is also the pressure of prolonged ethnic tensions in Indonesia before Mr. Joko, in which the members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more narrow-minded path.
Christian and Muslim tribesmen used knives, arrows and bows, and other village weapons, fighting on the streets killed more than 1,000 people and displaced thousands from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturgeon beat Chelsea
Daniel Sturgeon scored a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London to save Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
He received a pass from Sherdan Shakiri, who was about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while Sturge's team was 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball on his left side and then took a shot at the remote post.
His effort went to the top of the box and went to the upper corner on the right side of the net.
Finally, the ball went over the cape Arizabalaga, who was carrying the ball, and fell into the net.
"When he was just trying to get into that position, to come on the ball and always play forwards as much as possible, I tried to make as much time for myself as possible," Sturgeon told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming and touching it once and didn't think much about it and just shot one."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the middle after a score from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
At that time, the Blues striker sent a pass back to Matteo Kovacic, then took a stroll near the midfield and ran into the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go on the midfield.
Then he hit a beautiful blow, so Hazzard went into the box.
Hazard pierced the defense plank and saw Liverpool's Alison Baker finish his game by putting a shot in the distance post with the left leg.
Liverpool will take on the Champions League at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy on Wednesday.
Chelsea will take on Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll in Indonesia's Tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake is said to have left several people trapped in the debris of buildings and caused a 20-foot-high quake, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the organisation at a news conference.
In the city of Palu, more than 380,000 people live, the buildings that have fallen there are now piles of rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man after the death of a woman.
The body of a woman was found this morning in Berkeley, Maryland.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Meowz on John Street with injuries to his dead body.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Berkenhead to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would like to appeal to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have made any momentum on Dashcam Foote, to contact us as they may have the necessary information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Burkenhead and her body was found inside a building.
A friend of mine called me this morning and asked me where I was.
An investigation is underway and the family members of the deceased have been informed.
A taxi driver in Grayson Meowz was trying to enter his flat, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he saw what had happened.
Residents were told they would be allowed to return to the building after several hours.
A police officer said the entire area has been identified as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene and was crying.
She said repeatedly, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the siege and another van was outside.
Several officers were standing inside the siege and monitoring the blocks of the flats.
If anyone has any information, they should give it to DM <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by mentioning Log 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is a fresh monument to the controversy of rewriting history
If removed, it would be like giving a poetic justice because the puritans of his fiery head have carried out the taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr. Crick's suggestion was "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current controversy over the removal of the statues would insinuate an image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell didn't say that the English Civil War was going to happen.
Perhaps their ancestors in the preceding century would have been victimized by the wrong chromewell for Thomas' actions.
The magnificent description of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorncroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the historical narrative of this personality, which many believe is still venerable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "In the opinion of many, perhaps more so in the latter half of the 19th century than today, Cromwell was, in the opinion of many, a supporter of Parliament than of external pressures, in his case, of course, of royalty.
Whether the description is absolutely accurate has been the subject of a consistent historical debate.
One thing is for sure that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell is a personal identifiable person who represents one side of that valley.
His performance as Lord Protector is also festive and memorable."
Mastwal Dukar kills Chinese farmer
Local media reported that a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwestern part of China.
The man's surname is "Yuan," and he was found dead in a broken vessel, lying in a pool of blood at the Lipponshui market in Gwishu province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a hogwarts in China's Qinghai province.
It was reported that he had come to the market with his cousin to sell 15 pigs from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found the door of the nearby pig cage open.
He said that there was a large man in the cage who was bleeding from his mouth.
A forensic examination has confirmed that the 550-pound dukaran had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and messed up," said another brother, whose surname was "woo," Guiyang Evining News quoted him as saying.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig who killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Ivining News that the pig had been locked up to prevent anyone from attacking him, and police were collecting evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though this incident is rare, pigs have already reported incidents of assault on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds hit a Welsh farmer on his tractor, and his wife drove him away.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Menitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but can "smell" blood.
"They're just playing games.
They're very clever, they don't want to kill you.
"You just have to respect them," he said.
Heavy to very heavy rains likely in North America due to Cyclone Rosa
According to estimates, the Rosa storm is decreasing as it moves into more cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, heavy rains are expected in parts of North America and Mexico in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5 a.m. Eastern Time, Rosa's wind speed was 85 miles per hour, that is, it is a Category 1 hurricane and is 385 kilometers southwest of Punta Uganda.
Ros is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a typhoon is taking shape over the Pacific Ocean and it is moving eastwards towards the West Coast of the United States. As a tropical storm approaches the Rosa Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push temperate humidity into the deep northwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Later, along with the incoming cyclonic storm, moderate humidity is likely to intensify into heavy to very heavy rainfall in the southwestern part of the state in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain is likely to cause hazardous flooding, debris to flow and potentially landslides in the desert.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 3 inches per hour at some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, due to moderate humidity in the deep.
Rainfall between 2 and 4 inches is expected in most parts of the Southwest, especially in Arizona.
Due to the disruptive nature of the temperate rains, there is a possibility of sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is very dangerous to go out in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can make the canyons run dry, causing strong winds and dust storms at the local level.
Heavy rains are expected in parts of the southern California coast.
More than half an inch of rain is possible, which can lead to light debris flowing down the road.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
There will be some light rain in Arizona on Sundays and Mondays, followed by late Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy rains are expected to continue into Tuesday and continue into Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder, there may be some severe fluctuations in temperatures in October, but the temperate part will remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to a dramatic change in temperature over a short period of time.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in Central America.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat of summer will continue to rise and expand.
The southern plateau is expected to reach the northeastern part of the United States by a warmer beginning in early October with a wide range of 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City could rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the normal average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, temperatures are likely to be higher than average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have heard of Bret Cavano.
Bread Kevinno, appointed by the Supreme Court and a woman who was allegedly sexually assaulted in the 1980s, witnessed the emotional testimony given by Christine Blase Ford on Thursday by more than 20 million people, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, while maintaining a political stance, broadcasters broke regular schedules by side on Friday at the last minute: a deal made by Arizona Sen: FBI's Jeff Flake will run the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kevin was caught drunk at a high school party and tried to take off his clothes.
Kevin, giving a very emotional testimony, said that we are 100% sure that such a thing did not happen.
On Friday, more than 20.4 million people were likely to have seen the testimony, Nelson said.
The company is counting the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, which showed the program, could not be immediately available.
And Nelson usually has some problems in counting the number of people seen in the offices.
In this view, the number is the same as the number of spectators for a playoff football match or an Academy Award.
Nelson said that Fox News channel, which has a strong backing for Cavenna's appointment, took the lead on all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing.
ABC finished second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nelson said.
After the hearing, the excitement intensified.
Friday's play was the focal point of flakes.
After the central Republican office issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Cavendish, CNN and CBS cameras momentarily issued a statement against him while he was on his way to Jinnah to attend the Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday morning.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes and was televised live on CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," she said.
Do you think they are telling the truth?
She said, "You have all the power."
Fleck said his office had issued a statement before the elevator was shut down, saying that we have more to say in the committee's hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was to vote to send Cavendish's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote, cable and broadcast networks made all the telecasts several hours later.
But Fleck said it would only do so on the basis of the assumption that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the minority Democrats that they are urging for next week's appointment.
His conversations with his mistress, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, were partly confirmed by Fleck.
After a lengthy discussion with the president and several other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Cavendish without an investigation.
The FBI has launched an investigation into President Trump's accusations against Cavendish.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "politicizing" Brexit.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "politicizing" Britain's future and undermining national interest on her plans to leave the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived in Birmingham, UK, on September 20, 2018, for a crowded party conference.
In one of his other interviews on the newspaper's homepage, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked his alleged checkered plan for Brexit, a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's taxes is "totally unreliable."
Shooting: Police arrest suspect Dietitian Simmons in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a 20-year-old basketball player, Wedi Sims, at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dietitian Simson was arrested and jailed for second-class murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Sims, and police said Sims's glasses were missing in the attack.
According to CBS Associate WAFB, the police seized the glasses from the spot and said that Simson's DNA was on it.
After questioning Simson, the police said he confessed to having shot Wadi and killed him.
The lawyer said his bond amount was fixed at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the gun shot was believed to have hit the head.
The department has given credit to the Lausiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, The State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for assisting in the investigation.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the regional legislative bodies for their "intensity and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was aged 20 years.
This forward player, 6 feet 6 inches tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He earned an average of 5.6 last season and took 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had been "destroyed" by Vedi's death and "shocked."
"It's always something to be concerned about," Wade said.
Flooding in Mexico City.
The ash emanating from the Poketpel volcano has reached the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after it began to move rapidly into the volcano on Saturday, leaving 183 lots of gas and ash out in 24 hours.
A number of fires and explosions were reported from the area.
Pictures showing the windows of a car with a pile of ashes in nearby cities such as Shochimilco, Mexico City, were on social media.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in movements in the area of the volcano, which lies 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital. In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico.
The volcano, Don Goo, has been active since 1994.
An encounter broke out between the police and the Catalan separatists ahead of the Independence Day celebrations.
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona, and tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on secession.
When the riot police intercepted a group of separatist supporters wearing masks, they threw eggs and coloured torches, causing dust to accumulate on the streets which were overturned by airwave tourists.
Later in the day, when the encounter broke out, the police used a baton to stop it.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No Forgotten, No Forgiven" and proclaimed "Spain should be crushed."
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries in the encounter.
The paratrooper had been living in the region for a year after the October 1 referendum, which was held by the Catalan separatist, considered illegal by Madrid.
A large number of voters chose to become independent, but the number of voters remained low as those who were against the division boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan administration, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop polling at polling stations amid violent clashes across the region last year.
The pro-independence groups staged a sit-in protest in support of the National Police on Friday night.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different path.
Narciss Terminus, 68, the electrician, along with his wife, participated in a separatist protest and said he no longer had hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"We had a very good life last year.
"I saw tears of joy in my parents' eyes when I voted, but we were stuck," he said.
Despite a small, yet significant victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, and many of their popular leaders have either accepted anonymity or are waiting to prosecute them for their role in organizing a referendum and then the Declaration of Independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, who spoke on the phone in support of the police, said the clash was backed by politicians from both sides.
“The fight is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, nine of the Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, Oriol Junckeras, announced that he would contest next year's European parliamentary elections.
"The best way to stand as a candidate for the European elections is to devalue our democratic values and protest our smiles on the Spanish government," he said.
London: Man arrested after entering car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly intruding a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballinagrad Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blamings said the entrances and buildings were also damaged.
A crossbow was also thrown on the car at one point.
Meng's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Meng's first goal for Livingston
Steven Gerrard, the manager of the Ibrox Club, was surprised by the Rangers' promotion to ease his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Meng's attack made the rounds and Gary Holt's team equalled Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team lost without a win in the Premiership this season and next Sunday, they will face Harts, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, the Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston will continue its unbeaten run in six games in the division, his coach Holt has not seen a loss since taking the lead from Kenny Myler last month.
Livingston opens up to hosts
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they got the points, as their exact defeat put the Rangers in complete jeopardy.
Scots-Robinson opened the scoring but slammed it in front of the goal, then it was only after Alan Lithgow moved Craig Hollett's header into the goal that he was able to expand his effort.
The hosts knew that they could bring trouble to the hosts, so they were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how it became an important goal.
The Rangers gave a free-kick and got a free kick to Livingston. Decklan Garage and Robinson paired up with Menga, taking possession of the ball and scoring a goal from the middle of the box.
By that time, the Rangers had maintained their dominance but the opposition's defensive line was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelley had not suffered much,
The same pattern will remain in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos had to make one save from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan Maggregor's legs confounded Scott Pittman and Lithgow sent the ball even further away from Livingston.
Crosses in the Livingston box continued to come and go, and were eliminated, with two penalty claims – a challenge by Halkett to substitute player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball – being abandoned.
"Unprecedented" by Livingston
Alasdair Lemant Tony Macroni at the BBC Scotland Arena
It's a great game and a great win for Liverpool.
He played well, he played well, he performed better than expected, he said.
His style and style of play has rarely changed since his return from the top spot, but Holt's arrival should give him a big credit for the way he shaped the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played heart-to-heart, he led a well-crafted defensive lineup, while Mengan continued to keep on beating Conor Goldson and Joe Vorall.
However, the motivation of the Rangers declined.
As much as he was led by Gerard, he fell short of his standard of play.
His last game was a lackluster – only once he hit the local team – a kind of warning to the Rangers who were the middlemen in the training.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was given a warm welcome in Cologne.
On Saturday, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany with the aim of improving relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's inclusion in the EU.
Later, he went to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
Turkey has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Police said there were security reasons for not crowding 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters had gathered near to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters - many of them Kurdish - also voiced their opinion, protesting Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome his country.
The dual demonstrations reflected only the dividing image of these guests, who were regarded as heroes by some German Turks and hailed as dictators by others.
Deptford road accident: Biker dies after being hit by car
A biker was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident, a busy road in Deptford, took place near the confluence of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics helped, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This is the second accident in the city, just a few months after a cyclist was killed in a collision on Childrens Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the deceased and inform his close relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed and motorists have been advised to avoid that part.
Long Lartine jail: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured after a riot in a men's very safe prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin at 9:30 BST on Sunday and it continues.
Expert Tornado officials have been summoned to deal with the riots, with eight prisoners involved in the riots and limited to one wing.
The officers sustained minor injuries on their faces and were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the HMP Long Latte incident.
Six patients were treated for the injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence, and the responsible people will be sent to the police and they will have to spend more time in jail."
There are more than 500 inmates in HMP Long Lartine, including some of the most dangerous accused in the country.
In June, the governor was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot officials were called in to deal with the severe riots in which employees were attacked by bridge balls.
Cyclone Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry parts likely to benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low-pressure band, but the exact same is likely to happen next week as the Cyclone Rosa along with the rest of its force moves south-westwards into the desert, so there is a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flooding in West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
Ros is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain coming in late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained their status or low pressure belt in the 200-mile area of Phoenix since 1950!"
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecast by the National Cyclone Centre, there will be 2 to 4 inches of rain and up to 6 inches of rain in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while at the same time, 4 inches of rain is likely to fall at the spot.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the rain coming from the rains will be beneficial as the region is facing drought.
Although flooding is a matter of concern, a little rain can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently facing a drought situation.
According to the U.S. Draught Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a low-intensity drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the Rosa Cyclone route will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The maximum wind speed was 85 miles per seven on Sunday, and it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing more cold water in the Pacific, which reduces its power.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the form of a tropical storm.
Heavy rains are expected in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which can fall up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
The Rosa will then proceed in the form of a tropical low-pressure belt as a tropical storm north of Mexico before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, which will then pass through Arizona and enter the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main crisis caused by Rosa or its balance influence is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are likely to cause landslides and landslides in the hilly areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested on murder charge
Three minors and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The minor boy was found in injured condition at about 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where his condition was stated to be stable.
Somerset police said a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight.
Officials have urged all those who have mobile footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Cavanaugh was "selfish and angry" with the Democratic Party.
"One vote for Justice Cavendish is a vote to reject the brutal and provocative behavior of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavendish had been "selfish, angry" by the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Cavendish strongly and fervently denied allegations of sexual assault on Christine Blasey Ford when she was a minor.
Ford also confirmed the allegations in the case.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw "the genius and quality and courage of Cavendish."
"The opinion of Justice Keveno confirms the opinion of one of the most successful law experts of our time, a judge with a bright career in public service," he told a West Virginia supporter's gathering.
The President spoke of the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
It's been five weeks of the most important election of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing up, but I'm standing up," he said.
"I'm going to fight against the big guys."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a campaign of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior GOP leadership colleague told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Cavendish's nomination is expected by Friday.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami kills hundreds, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and several others were evacuated after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beaches of the city of Palu for a celebration on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) high wave hit the coast, killing many and destroying everything in the way.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami struck yesterday, people were doing their work on the coast and they did not leave immediately and were killed," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, told reporters in Jakarta.
"This Tsunami did not come alone, she was dragged into cars, ondkes, houses, she hit everything on the ground," Nugroho added, adding that the Tsunami travelled at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) through the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed up trees and survived the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Management Agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The city was also hit by an earthquake on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute of Evaluation and Technology Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the power generated from Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city, which is situated on the edge of a long, narrow gulf, must have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some people trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings were found, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher in the Dongala area, 300 km north of Palu, near the epicenter of the quake.
"There was no information from Dongala that the communication was "completely disrupted," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people were living here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a crisis, but the situation could get worse," he said.
Officials said that the warning had been issued early on Saturday, but there was widespread reliance on the organisation for not reporting that Palu had been hit by the tsunami.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man is seen standing on the top floor of a building warning people down the road.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the beach, and buildings and cars were swept away.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and the tsunami disrupted power supply and disrupted communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The Army has started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but rescuers are in dire need of food and other basic amenities, officials said.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision staff have safely reached Palu city, where staff have set up paddocks in their office premises and seen demolition scenes on the way, said Doseba.
"I've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Some have complained that foreign aid workers with deep experience are being forced to go to Palu, as relief groups have begun their preparations for disaster relief.
According to Indonesia's rules, only foreign funds, supplies and personnel can go there if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasnt happened yet.
"The teacher is at the provincial level of disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aaliya Ariani.
"Once the government said, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' then we will open up for international assistance, but this is not the case."
When the second night in Palu came after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be found by doing miracles as such stories are found in natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped under the rubble for two days along with her mother's body.
Two paragliders who were trained for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month by the Indonesian national paragliding team's coach, Gendan Subandono, are missing.
The other one who was stuck in the hotel was our students, said Mandgi.
As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
He said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel being spread in the Paragliding community, he had sent WhatsApp messages to Palu contestants who participated in the festival.
However, their messages, instead of the two blue ones, remained only one light mark.
"I don't think that's the message," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from Newport ATM
According to a report by the Newport Police Department, the burglars stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning while paying at an ATM in Newport.
"The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money,"" said Detective Dennis McCarthy."
While he was busy, another man ran after the Brink employee and ran away with a bag of money for delivery.
The paper said that the witnesses saw several suspects running away from the spot, but the police did not specify the exact number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone has any information about their identity, call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
KENYA WEST: Rapper changed his name
Rapper Kenny West has changed his name.
While announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It was formally called Kenney West."
The 41-year-old was nicknamed West for a while, and took the title of Moniker for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Albany.
The singer, Ariana Grande, has been replaced by the actor who left the show for "emotional reasons."
Just as an abbreviation of his current business name, West previously stated that the word is religiously important to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you, you,'" West said earlier this year while discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
I am you, you are me, you are me.
This change from Kenya, that is, the only one, that is, our good, our bad, our confusion, everything has been a mere reflection of it.
This album is more a reflection of who we are.”
This is one of the most popular brands that have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names like Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Daddy, but this year he announced that he liked the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West Coordinator, J-Z, has also made similar changes with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel López Obrador, the Mexican presidential candidate, has vowed never to use the military against civilians in the wake of the 50th anniversary of bloody action against students.
López Obrador on Saturday vowed to "never use the military to emulate Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters, killing about 300 people, during which the left-wing student movement was rooted in Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said that due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities, the youth are turning to criminal gangs.
U.S. to double A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) fund supply
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, investor and AI businessman Kai-Fu Li has said that Lee has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple to double the amount the US spends on research in the sector.
The United States does not have a formal AI policy, but it has reacted to the announcement by various departments of the US government regarding AI.
In the meantime, China launched its plan last year, which aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The double AI research budget will be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the US, and we look forward to the next revolution in AI," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding supply will double the chance of AI's next major success in the United States.
Li's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who is the CEO of Cynovation Ventures, a company that has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee referred to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, so as to help people explore the future.
In the United States, researchers have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“The academics are not being hijacked by China, they are being taken by corporates,” Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired eminent people from universities to work on AI.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy will also help the US strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically issued for PhD in AI.
China's State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation of the United States and other government institutions provide funding to researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center, where industry and education will be partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
In the case of NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
A US law aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been approved for months.
Macedonians voted to change the name of their country.
On Sunday, Macedonians voted for a referendum on whether to rename their country "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would end their decades-long dispute with Greece, as Greece banned its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, insisting that its northern neighbor's name is a claimant to its territory and that the country's accession to NATO and the EU has been denied.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change will be the root cause of the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the general election and that the boycott campaign raised doubts that the number of voters would be at least 50 per cent required to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that it is a price for Macedonia to pursue admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO, a country that has emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under one umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Giorgioveska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Though not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that we shall abide by the outcome of this opinion to make this view decisive.
A two-thirds majority will be required in Parliament to change the name.
The National Election Commission said that there was no irregularity till 1 pm.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I'm out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Jose Tanevsky, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zhaev, his wife Zorika and son Dushko voted in a referendum on the country’s name change on September 30, 2018 in Sturmika, Macedonia. The change will open the door for the country to enter NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old housemaid, Vladimir Kawardarkov, is building a small platform in front of tents and chairs for public boycotts.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate with a firm view, not with the back door," said Kavdarkov.
Our country is poor, but we are proud of it.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can move to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia coordination."
Prime Minister Zhaev said NATO membership would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia as it has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the majority will support because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO," Zhaev said after the vote.
He said that if the result is "yes," then it will be "a confirmation of our future."
A poll published by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research on Monday said that 30 to 43 percent of voters will vote in the general election — a lower percentage than the required percentage.
In another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 per cent of voters were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be successful, it needs to be 50 per cent more votes.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the West-Congress government's policy, which came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scored a goal for the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal from Averroes in the 65th minute was very easy.
This Argentine styker and got a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the order.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders before hitting the open field.
Averroes was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed the ball around one of the defenders and then pushed several people to the side of the Brighton box.
Then he took a step to the left, and there was a stroller.
The English forward, using his first touch in the box, gave the ball back to Aguero, using the right boot and hit Bryant's keeper Matthew Ryan on the right side of the net.
There are some problems with the foundation of Aguero," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We've been playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But Stirling's Sky Blues won the toss and opted to bat first in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Averroes got the ball inside the Brighton area at that time.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sen on the left.
Sen took some touchdowns and then leaned towards the post towards the sterling distance.
The blue skies forward tapped the ball into the net a little before heading out of the boundary.
City will face Hoffnheim in the Champions League at 12:55 pm at the Rhine-Necker-Arena in Germany.
Sherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
With the nationals out of the series, there was no reason to start with another forceful start.
But ready for the competition, sherzerna is expected to challenge the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but it would still be advantageous to play a chain match for the Rockies, who took a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
On Friday night, Rocky scored a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they are still waiting to fight for their first division book.
"We're not playing for anything, but knowing that Denver's atmosphere will be crowded, we can at least come out behind the rubber and play another team at the highest level I haven't played at any time this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they may have an alleged tendency to let Sherzer come on such occasions.
Sherzer, who is set to start his 34th season, held a bullpen session on Thursday and will be keeping an eye on his usual selections on Sunday.
This is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA this season, and 220 2/3 innings have 300 strikeouts.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
The President spoke of the importance of the presence of Republicans in the midterm elections, pointing out the circumstances surrounding Brett Cavendish, elected by the Supreme Court.
What we're doing is going to be difficult in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
It’s one of the biggest, big – I’m not fighting but I’m really fighting, that’s why I’m going everywhere for big candidates.
Trump said, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, it's all happening now.
And they have determined to regain power in any necessary way, you see, this selfishness, this cruelty.
They don't care who has hurt them, they don't care who has trampled them to get power and control, that's why they want power and control, we won't give them that."
He said the Democrats are on a campaign to "resist and block."
And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, referring to the Democrats as "repressed and selfish and ruthless and crooked."
The Senate Judiciary Committee referred to the nomination of Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, who was widely praised by the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you open the document.
Oh, oh, what.
No, oh no, I wait for a – it was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
There is no longer a large church.
He can't stand what he says
It's no surprise that the people in my party voted to convict me.
Finally, I’m the latest in the Labour MP’s queue to say that we’re not welcome—only about speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague John Ryan received a similar treatment because she had a strong stance against hate speech.
In my case, I was criticised for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn in the guilty resolution.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy on national security, Europe, unfortunately, these are the same issues on which Jeremy had disagreements with previous leaders.
At a meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it was stated that "we want to be inclusive and productive in meetings."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night’s GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not have such an atmosphere and the word "more kind, more civilized" of politics has just been forgotten if, indeed, it begins.
It is increasingly clear that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is being weighed on the basis of whether the party leadership would be acceptable.
It started shortly after Jeremy was elected as a leader, because I would go around with colleagues who had previously expressed similar political views and I would never have agreed otherwise – be it national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly - and what I say doesn't really matter - there is a wave of defamation on social media that I should be disqualified, a protest against the Centre's politics, I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the reactions to me are political in nature.
I am amazed at the professional and determined nature of friends who don't shy away from everyday sexual or racial abuse.
One of the biggest disappointments in this era of politics is the level of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn voted last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so liberal that every "disbelief" proposal or change of the rules of choice will narrow the party down.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years, with a request to keep my head down and not speak more, after which my "everything will be fine."
I didn't do that in politics.
As a school student 32 years ago when I joined the Labour Party, as a local municipal servant or as a government minister, I have demanded better public services for those who are in dire need.
I've never been involved in politics before.
No person in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about the state of my policies and the area of disagreement with the current leadership.
For all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that the Brexit that the country is moving towards will adversely affect families, businesses and our social services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the fact is that the message I have is not for the Nottingham movement, it is for the people of my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no amount of threats or political justifications of ouster can deter me from my work, which I think is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Ir 38 – 17 Melrose: Ajinkya Rahane tops the list
The two late-trials may have had some adverse effects on the final result, but there is no doubt that Iyer deserved a day-long win in the amazingly entertaining Tenants Premiership.
They are currently the only team in the top 10 leagues.
Ultimately, his defense was just as good as his excellent ability to take chances, which gave the local team and coach Peter Merchy the absolute right to be happy.
"We've had so many tests for our game and we're still unbeaten, so I'm happy," he said.
Robin Christian of Melrose said: "The credit goes to Iron, they took advantage of opportunities in a better way than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial by Fraser Climo led Irwin, but a yellow card released by the Warriors for the Scotland Cape Rory Hughes earned Melrose points and Jason Baggett pulled out an improvised trial.
Clemson had a half-time lead to Ireland with a penalty, after which he returned to a single-trial lead to Ireland 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose made a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's Trilla Bagt reversed and reduced the gap by five points.
The game was then halted for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken on a stretcher and moved further from the resumption of Ir Stafford McDowell's Trelaw Clemo's reflection.
Ir's seasonal captain, Blair McPherson, was later given a yellow card, and again, Melrose took advantage of an extra player, including Bruce Colvin's Trio, at the end of the extreme tense left.
Later, the local team made a comeback, but, and from the penalty line-out, Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card while tackling the ball without a clitoris, and McFarlane overcame the forward Ir.
After David Armstrong's box kick was caught by Kyle Rowe and sent away to Flanker Gregor Henry for the local team's fifth try, Clemson converted it as he did at the time of the restart.

After learning that Steel Game star Ford Kirnan has been appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company, he took steps to shift to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old has played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-starred with long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphyll.
The pair have announced that the ninth series of the show will be the final, and Kieran is planning his life after work in Craigslist.
As per the formal record listing, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.

“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes to open its way to the Pacific.
The ship sails to the Rigging-clad Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
The flags of the sky are hoisted on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon to the base of the navy, the following motto appears: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to do it."
The memories of the beaches lost in the bloody conflict with Chile from the resources of the 19th century are still alive in the entire landlocked Bolivia - as if sailing in the Pacific Ocean is yet to happen.
Those hopes are perhaps the highest in a decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, unity and courage, and of course expects positive results from the outcome," said Roberto Cazadilla, Bolivia's ambassador to the United States.
Many Bolivians across the country will see the ICs on the big screen, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will deliver a verdict in Bolivia’s claim – after decades of ups and downs – Chile has accepted its commitment to negotiating an autonomous sea route to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charming local president, Evo Morales, who is facing a contentious fight for re-election next year, is also largely dependent on Monday’s election.
At the end of August, he promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
But according to some analysts, the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia – and even if it does, the situation will not change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Chile's territory, and has contracted that it will not determine the outcome of prospective negotiations.
The final dispute took place just six months after the ICJ was elected, which indicated that the case was "not inconvenient," said Paiz Zarate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And for the sake of Bolivia, it must have been pushed back over the last four years.
"The case for obtaining a sea route has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has put an end to Chile's reputation, he suggested.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will start talking, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welze, has refuted the view that the court's decision-making process is unusually dynamic.
"Monday will be a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to usher in a new era of relations with Chile," he said, adding that there will be an opportunity to put an end to 139 years of disagreement with each other's benefits.
Morales is still the most popular leader in Latin America, even as Calzodilla denies that he was using the maritime issue as a political kibbutz.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to get a path to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This result is an opportunity to see what the past has to be overcome."
North Korea says it won't denuclearize the U.S. unless it has confidence in the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that if his country does not trust Washington, it will never be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons.
He was speaking at a general meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC).
He called on the UN to abide by the promises made by the UN during the meeting in Singapore between rivals.
His opinion comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stood in the way of a resumption of nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "visional illusion," which maintained sanctions and U.S. objections to such a declaration, which would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is aware of Pyongyang's acceptance of the Declaration without first stepping into significant disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But Pyongyang is very doubtful about the seriousness of abandoning its scientists, as the country considers this to be the only guarantee for its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show presents the latest category of gigantic to reach a main street near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or want full protection from the sun, don't look elsewhere.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of hats for their SS19 collections, which led to a style of guiding the eyes at the Paris Fashion Week
This summer, the highly impractical hats made their presence on Instagram, and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to Catwalk.
One extravagant piece of Valentino was an over-the-top ping tinge hat, decorated with a wide assortment of pings, which adorned the models' heads nicely.
Other more-sized accessories had collings decorated with precious gems, a magical hat and a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brownie also presented a range of such extraordinary masks - and that too in the time of Halloween.
There were a lot of colorful masks and they looked more like a handyman than a fashionable one.
One structure was similar to the scuba diving gear, with ventilators and goggles, while the other one looked like a dissolved ice cream angle.
If you're able to use this great tool, you'll be lucky.
Those who observe these styles were predicting that a huge amount of these hats could be found on the main road near you.
The over-sized hats were visible on the heels of La Lamba, with a two-foot wide edged straw hats, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Another large structure, named after these highly impractical hats, was sent to Catwalk by the community's name on social media - a straw beach bag, like a swimsuit-wearing young model, who may have taken the baby.
The short film Orange Raffia Bag, trimmed by Rafia Jhalar and with a white leather handle in the upper part, was the best piece of Jackemaze La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told Fimmel: “I was expecting big hats and beach bags to come on the main road for the next summer – the designer made such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for this hugely sized device.”
John Edwards: Language Skills Required for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain academic excellence, and it has also been running in 2018, adding yet another set of unusual test results, credited only to individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), who strive to deliver the best quality of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their place as a global citizen.
As an education sector that can design and implement pre-school curriculum, we are looking at modern languages as a popular and desirable choice among schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, he will go straight to his head."
"If you speak to a person in a language he understands, he will go straight to his heart.
It is a very important thing to remember that we cannot rely solely on English to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing rates among independent schools.
68% of foreign language learners received a higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin received a higher grade A, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners receiving an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject of choice is now being understood in the courses of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that language skills deficiencies were responsible for 17% of the reasons given by employers to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly essential for the youth to prepare for their future careers.
These skills have become essential in a globalized world, with more potential job opportunities that require language.
Regardless of what career they choose, if they have learned another language, they can get a real benefit in the future because of such lifelong skills.
With the ability to interact directly with people from abroad, the multilingual person will automatically be placed at the forefront of the competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language that was enlarged and in which only French was spoken by double digits i.e. 15 percent of the population.
This is why it is important to invest in language learning for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially those with a developing economy, will create better opportunities for children to get meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
Many schools focus on more elite modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Even if your child is interested in something, there are plenty of languages to choose from in independent schools, and there is also an expert teacher class to teach in related areas.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare students and equip them with skills to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that language is very important for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Bring back the bacon.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron James' fans have been eagerly waiting to see him play his first match for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in the pre-season opening match in San Diego on Sunday.
It remains to be seen how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
Mike Trudeau, a reporter for Lakers, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After the practice, James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of Lakers.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's Rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launched a campaigning lesson for the Rallyes in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This was the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, with a stopover at his favourable locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By blocking a confirmation vote for his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans fear losing control of Congress when the vote is due in November.
What time is Trump's Rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s Wheeling, the Rally in West Virginia, is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's Rally in West Virginia live streamed online on YouTube.
Trump may address this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, a case that has become strained by allegations of sexual misconduct, with the Senate withholding a confirmed vote for up to a week for a FBI investigation.
But the main aim of these rallies is to help the Republicans gain some momentum in the coming November elections.
Thus, Trump's campaign said that the purpose of the five rallies this week is to "energize the volunteers and supporters, as they seek to protect and grow the majority in the Republican Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to their agenda that as we move forward in this hectic campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally scheduled for Vesbanco Arena in Wheeling "can bring in a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News said in a statement.
This will be the second visit to West Virginia in a month, from which he won more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey is trying to help Trump.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to help him in these elections," said Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States is determined to fight to keep the Sunday singles alive.
After three solo sessions, the squad on Saturday afternoon gave the rider a performance that he wanted.
The helcave-eating momentum oscillator is a completely invented concept in sports, but it's one thing that players are completely confident about, and never more than such a competition.
Where are they going to put that momentum?
"They had a six-digit lead and now it's four, so I think we're getting a little bit faster now," Jordan Spith said.
Europe is in a favourable position, of course, with four points ahead and 12 more in the game.
Americans feel, says Spieth, that even though there is less wind in the way of their balls, and they have a lot to encourage, not just because of the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each earned three points out of four.
Spith has been aggressive from tea to green and his leadership is exemplary.
When he and Thomas were two behind, he took the important putt and edited all four squares as soon as his round began.
It was because of his putt that he was responsible for winning the match at the age of 15, which would have made you realize that he believes Americans are still in competition.
"You've got a lot more to do and you've got to take care of yourself," Spieth said.
Each of these games is about what is left.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
Players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the storyline of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unparalleled, but charming pair earned four out of four and there was no mistake in that.
"Mollywood" was the only pair that couldn't shoot a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and supported the nine on Friday morning.
The run, and the excitement that followed the crowd that cried out, seemed like they were the losers on Sunday, and as the sun began to set on Le Golf National, there would have been no more popular players to sustain a possible European victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
The two are at the same time in different hotels.
However, the history of the European Union has remained unchanged.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson cut short the work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foreballs, when he was paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey on the front nine dots and two double-built Spanish and Swedish have never reached close to a single hole.
On Sunday, there was no one to help you.
The reason why foreballs and foursomes were extremely attractive to watch closely was because there was harmony in the pairs, the advice they gave, and the advice they didn't give, and the way in which there was a strategy that could change in a moment.
Europe as a team has played well, so took a significant lead on the final day, but even in this four-season session, the team USA showed a fighting spirit for it, especially on the Stateside, where there were doubts.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a strong advantage on the final day of the Rider Cup with a 10-6 lead over the United States after coming out of Saturday's Foreballs and Foursomes matches.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the match with two victories over Tiger Woods, taking their tally to four points on Le Golf National.
Defeated at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Jr.'s European team won the series 3-1 over the wrong-played American team in the morning's Foreballs in an effort to keep the Cup.
Europe resisted more in the foursomes and won the Dr. matches, but they could not compensate for the loss.
Jim Frick's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the Cup alive.
Fleetwood became the first European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were called "Mollywood," were the only pair to win all four points from their opening four games in the Ryder Cup history after a thrilling weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foreballs, they made the 5th and 4th of the game even more unbeaten in the desperate Woods and the USA's Bryson Dashbulls.
Woods, who was pulled out by two matches on Saturday, will occasionally be the pick of excellence, but lost 19 of his 29 matches in the Foreballs and Foursomes and seven in the lineup.
Justin Rose, who was rested in the morning's foreballs, returned to the forecourts with partner Henrik Stanson and defeated world number one and three Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1.
There's nothing that could have been done to make Europe adapt to a breathtaking and breathtaking day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won the Foreballs by John Rahm and Ian Polter in a tie-breaking 2 and 1 and then came back after losing the first two holes in the Foreballs, defeating Polter and Rory McLaroy in the 4th and 3rd.
Although there is only one draw needed to keep the former champions' team from winning the World Cup, it has happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has made a comeback from a four-point loss while going into the singles.
After being second-best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack felt like they were out of their nest.
North Korea says it has no intention of unilaterally disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions have fueled confidence in the United States and in such a situation, it will not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organization with Ri Yong-ho, North Korea said it had made "significant progress" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying sites for nuclear tests, and promising not to increase nuclear and nuclear technology.
"We have not received any response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any reliance on the US, we will have no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Pyongyang reiterates North Korea's usual grievances about Washington's resistance to the denuclearization, under which North Korea was to be rewarded for taking slower steps, their statement is notable, with Pyongyang not reluctant to stop unilateral denuclearization as it did before.
In the first meeting between the US President and the North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, Renee referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, in which Kim promised to work towards "stopping the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," while Trump promised North Korea's defense.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. is first insisting on "stopping nuclearization" and is increasingly raising the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objectives and also raising objections to a "declaration of an end to war," Ri said.
"It's a vision that will bring us down to the knees of those who don't know us.
"The problem is that we are losing confidence."
Ree made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which U.S. leaders mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and said: "If South Korea had been a party to this problem of denuclearization and the U.S. had it not, there would have been no such confusion about stopping the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
However, Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he addressed the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the mainland of the U.S., including North Korea's rockets, when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" aimed at suicide.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions should continue until North Korea's denuclearization is stopped.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "Even if it took two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia debated this in the UN. Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue swiftly and firmly until a complete, final, and verified cessation of nuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and explosive missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside and said at the UN General Assembly that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July as if progress had been made, only for North Korea, in a matter of hours, to make this announcement, he was making "slander-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised that if the United States takes relevant measures, it would destroy the site of the missile and, as well as the nuclear complex."
He said Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he wanted would be to take steps to ensure the security promised by Trump in Singapore and normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course of rest adequately.
Harvard University is bringing a new curriculum for all its undergraduates to sleep more this year to cope with the ever-increasing masculine culture through a ‘night-wake’ cafe-service.
An academic found that when it comes to basic information about how to care for one of the world's number one universities, it was often found to be ignorant.
Charles Chizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a curriculum that is believed to be the first in the US to be similar to him.
He was inspired to start this course by giving lectures on the effects of sleep deprivation on education.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why was I told this story when I was in my final year?’
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
This course, first introduced this year, explains how students and athletes need to have a good sleep habits to improve their performance as well as their overall health.
Paul Bariera, a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care, said the university has decided to start the course after a week of severe sleep deprivation.
The course consists of a series of interactive objectives.
There is an image of a dorm room in one area, in which students are taking coffee, and curts, coaches, and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation had an impact on athletes' performance and the importance of regulating sleep time.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then inspires participants to think about their routines.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe that they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking," said Professor Chizler.
There is a culture of pride in waking up all night long, he said, adding that the emphasis on modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, which meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality, adequate sleep should be a secret weapon to overcome student stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because if the brain is deprived of sleep, it keeps them hungry and constantly hungry.
Raymond Sone, a 19-year-old who teaches chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chizler design the course, which he took during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that those courses opened his eyes and inspired him to promote campus-wide courses.
He hopes that in the next phase, all these postgraduate students will be told that they should complete a course like this before getting admitted to a competitive institution.
Professor Chizler recommended that students be alert to when to go to sleep and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which will disrupt the clock's rhythm in your body, causing sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Meng's goal gives Gerrard the sky
The Rangers suffered another setback when Dolly Meng's strike led to Steven Gerrard's upset team losing 1-0 at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team was looking for their first victory in their path after a 4-1 victory at St John's in February, but Gary Halt's team only lost Gerard's second of 18 games as manager, leaving their team eight points away from the leading Hearts of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes ahead of the half-time and never saw a team of low-intensity Rangers trying to equalize.
As the Rangers are now pushed to sixth place, Livingstone has moved up to third place and are only behind Hibernians at goal difference.
And there could be more problems for the Rangers as one item was thrown from the other end, so Lanceman Calam Spence had to be treated for the injuries on the head.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which overtook the changes of the mother in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played the same league with 11 people, who had earned a point from Hearts last week, and the way their competitors at every turn were tied with their fine tracks, he would have been very happy.
Even though the Rangers had more control of the ball, Livingston used more of the ball they had.
He could have scored in just two minutes when Meng's first-time take-off sent Scott Pittman into Ann McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed his big chance.
Keegan Jacobs sent a free-kick to captain Craig Holt, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, came back on the post.
The Rangers took possession but showed a lack of confidence in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morlos felt strongly that he and Steven Lawless should have received a penalty on the quarter-on-mark due to a collision but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
Rangers could only shoot two first-half shots at the target, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, did not have much trouble in blocking Lasana Colibela's header and Avey Izaria's unscathed strike.
The first goal of the 34th minute was against the flow of the game, but no one would argue that they earned it through hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to match the set-pieces of Jacobs on the Deep.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Goulgar gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Meng for easy completion.
Gerrard showed efficiency by calling Colbybella on Ryan Kent's place in the break and the change showed immediate effect. Morlos on the winger gave the pass but came out of his line to block the tremendous player Kelly.
But, after Lithgow and Holkett hit a long ball one after the other, Livingston continued to force guests to play in their favorite way.
In the final stages, Holt's team could have extended their lead, but McGregor stood firm to block Jacobs from Lithgow's distant corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton made a second claim for a penalty late on Jacobs hit, but Thomson didn't look at it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the geyser counter
And now a page in our Sunday Morning Almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, and beyond... On this day in Germany the future physicist Jonas William "Hans" Giger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the invention that led to the further discovery of the device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, in the mainstream of science, gigger counters have also become mainstream pop culture, such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado" starring seemingly cowboy-like scientists:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "This is the geyser counter, which is used to detect radioactive alkalis like uranium.
When you put on this earphone, you can actually hear the effect of atoms coming out of the alkalinity through the radiation."
Ivan: "They're poppin' now!"
Hans Giger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the search for his name was dead.
A new vaccine against cancer will teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
The new vaccine on cancer will teach the immune system to 'see' evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify evil cells as part of treatment
In this method, the immune cells of the patients are removed and transferred to the laboratory
They can then "smell" the proteins that are common in many cancers and then toss them back into the body.
This vaccine is showing promising results in different cancer patients.
After a woman was treated with a vaccine that taught her to identify malignant cells in the immune system, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, the immune cells in patients are removed and replaced by them in the laboratory so that they can "blood" the proteins that are common in many cancers, called HER2, and then tossed back into the body.
Professor Joe Berzofsky of the U.S. National Casser Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancer," which includes breast, ovarian, lung, as well as colorectal cancer.
Similarly, the approach to "educating" patients to remove immune cells from their cells and attack them with cancer cells is useful in one form of blood cancer.
After his appearance in the SNL, Kenny West wore a MAGA hat and slammed Trump's side.
They didn't like it
In the aftermath of Kenny West's protests, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and asked him to contest the 2020 election, people blew up his saturday night live in the studio.
On the night of his Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, after singing the third song, he began to protest against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I talked to a white man and he said: "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
"If I had been in the United States, I would have been in the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a skeet starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star slammed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been aired yet, the footage of West's 'Buddhist' comedian Chris Rock has been uploaded on social media.
It is not yet clear whether the West was trying to ridicule the post of Rock.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had to suffer behind the platform due to the hat in his head.
"They put me behind the wheel.
He said, "Don't put your hat on the platform."
They've screwed me!
And then he said, "I'm drowning," he told the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Have you seen the dried-up place?" So he said, "I'll wear my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what I should do. Do you think the world should move on?
Look at the love."
His comments were aired at least twice by the audience and many said that the cast member of the SNL appeared to be Khazil, one of whom told the publication: "The silence of death spread throughout the studio."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West performed a love it song in a peripheral bottle and got many people confused.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "For the most daring gesture: Thank you for standing up for the crowd."
But Karen Hunter, the talk show's organizer, tweeted that West was "just as it was and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I will not reward anyone who practices or spreads such ideologies that are detrimental to my community (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art")."
Its free.
"We are free," he said.
Earlier on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "formally known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, he followed Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, and Paddy.
The co-rapper, Snoop Dog, was formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music emperor Prince, who changed his name to the sign and the artist was formerly known as Prince.

The incident took place in Belagavi, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed through the public prosecution service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been hit by a virus.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticised Mardani Hero's styling, saying that such roles on the screen often seem like young children should be ruthless to gain respect.
"Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said he believes ""something is wrong"" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era."
Kitt, who recently got married to his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits he has a "very strong" desire to solve the problem.
"I feel very strongly about myself at the moment - what's wrong with our ancestry?" he said.
"What are we teaching them about the problem we are seeing now as humans grow up?"
Kitt believes that because of the extremely masculine characters on television, he is somewhat responsible for the growth that is taking place in toxic masculinity.
He added: "What is being taught and what is being taught?
Do you think that young children should have this particular aspect of being men because of what is taught on television and on the streets?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change that?
Something's wrong with the kids."
In the interview, he admitted that after the end of Game of Thrones next summer, he will not prequel or sequel it but he is 'boring the battlefield and the horses'.
From November, Kit will be working on the revival of Sam Shepherd's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best result of Game of Thrones is the visit of his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on the show so in that sense she gave me my future family and life ahead," he said.
In the Emmy award-winning fictional series, Rose played the character of Jon Snow's girlfriend Gritt.
The couple got married in June 2018 on a family property ground in Leslie's Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China's new cases rise by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS cases.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were caused by infection by intercourse, which indicates changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly due to contaminated blood donation in some parts of China.
However, Chinese health officials said that the number of people infected with HIV has dropped significantly to almost zero.
However, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection by sexual intercourse is a major problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has increased everywhere.
According to the study, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women because of the country's conservative values.
The inadequate protection of such relationships leads to the majority of infections.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been committed to global availability of HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters rejected the employee's claim that the GOP senator's data had been breached, saying it was a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy theory."
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were aired by pundits and websites of the "left-right group."
"Falseness, lies, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published allegedly included U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and residential addresses and phone numbers of Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
An unidentified man on Capitol Hill appeared online on Thursday during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The three of them were released after testing positive for the virus.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedStat reported that the IP address that identified the source of the post was related to the office of Waters and one of the employees of Waters displayed the information, The Vibration reported.
“These baseless allegations are completely false and baseless,” Waters added.
"Member of my staff - who was compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations of identity, personal information and security - is not responsible for the breach of this information in any way."
“These allegations are completely false and baseless.”
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online, including former White House press secretary Ari Flesher.
"It's frustrating," Fletcher writes.
"It shows that her character does not deserve to be a member of Congress.
It is not appropriate to be angry when someone is accused for what they have not done.
They should not be distracted.
They do not want to doubt the intentions of the accused.
They need to be calm and happy."
Flesher Waters' reaction was seen as a comparison to the criticism of Democrat Justice Kawanu, who was accused by critics of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is contesting the mid-term elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
"It's a really big thing," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "intimated appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that criminals are exposed," she added, "and they will be held legally responsible for all such acts that are dangerous to their destroyers and to any or all of the members of my staff."
John English Strikes Again Review - Less Effective Secret Paradox of Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition for British art to see the effects of Brexit in any new film, and this applies to the Johnny English action-comedy irony franchise - which began as Johnny English in 2003 and revived as Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
You will be happy to see how much we are worth as the country's new export opportunity.
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English of Ruby's face has been renewed for the second time - his name indicates that he has a huge comic creation design for viewers of movies outside of English.
He's certainly a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre promotion of Laghvi Glamour, seems a bit like Mr. Bean-like Clouso (stupid police) and the man's goon contributes a note to the dhun of the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is based on a traveler and mysterious international man who played in Barclays TV ads once forgotten by the character Atkinson and adds to his confusion.
There are also a couple of good moments in this latest JE film.
I love the fact that John is wearing a medieval armored jacket and going to the helicopter and hitting his head with feathers.
Atkins seems to be a gift of physical humor, but, in the backdrop of the fact that humor is much less effective and in particular "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include humor as a factor that seems strangely unnecessary.
Vinod is not for adults but for kids, and I don't think Johnny English's accident is as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent film comedy in the form of bean.
This is a common problem in the UK.
A cyber-hacker reveals the identity of all the agents at work in the UK by entering the super-secret web network of UK detectives, which shocks the agent at work - a very small role for Kevin Alden.
There is a last hope before the raging and wrangling pantheon whose political popularity has already dwindled: Emma Thompson has a great character like Tereza-me, but she doesn't have much in the story to do anything else.
Her intelligence advisers suggest that she has to bring in someone who has retired because of the disclosure of every active spy.
And this means that the idiot Johnny English, currently working as a school teacher in a luxurious colony, offers out-of-the-box lessons on how to become a spy operative: there are some good jokes here because the English school makes it an academy of rock-type espionage.
The Englishman is again called to an emergency briefing at Whitehall and meets again with his long-time colleague, Bo, who played by Bell Miller.
Bo is now married, married to a submarine commander, the Jolly-Hockey-Sticks role in which the potential of an artist like Vicky Pepperdine has been wasted.
In the secret service of every magician, Batman and Robin come face to face with the beautiful woman of Olga Kurilenko, Ophelia Bulettova.
In the meantime, Karisma is under the threat of a billionaire who claims that the Prime Minister can solve Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta, the horrific Jack Lacy.
English and Bo begin their journey of ridiculous fun: in a waiter's costume, they set fire to a fabulous French restaurant; smuggle themselves out of Volt's luxurious yacht; and the English chaotic by wearing a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with Volt's interior.
All the episodes have been pulled up for the last episode, but it feels like a children's TV show from how much fun and rioting it is.
Very good material.
And like other Johnny English films, I wondered this time: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role in his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected the British plan to work four days a week and get a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a four-day work week and a five-day salary plan.
The party alleged that the money saved by the company owners due to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution should be transferred to the employees by giving them an additional day's leave.
This will give employees a three-day week (weeks) but there will be no pay cut.
According to the sources, the idea is 'sensitive' in the economic agenda and policies of the party to lean the country towards the interests of its employees.
The four-day week was rewarded by the Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy changes are expected to be announced later this year.
“This will not happen overnight but a four-day work week is an aspiration that matches the party’s vision of reviving the economy in the interest of its employees as well as the party’s overall industrial policy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to award such an idea, the Green Party had promised a four-day work week in their campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this aspiration has not been fully rewarded by the Labour Party so far.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy, it is not the party’s policy.
Last week, Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Council to explain his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy in more detail.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of "faceless directors" and "beneficiaries" of utility companies.
The Finance Minister's scheme also means that the existing investors in the water bodies cannot get the full share of their investment back as the labour government can "reduce" on the basis of the malpractices seen there.
He also reaffirmed plans to create a comprehensive proprietary fund to take the workers to the boards of directors of the company, as well as to provide 10 per cent of the shareholdings of private sector entities to the employees who are eligible for annual dividend up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh has changed his views
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions as to whether any Republican members could be willing to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Peley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI was able to find anything that could alter their views.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleagues in South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I went to the court and spoke to Justice Kawanu.
All this happened, he came forward and I called him and asked, 'Why did you do this?'
He was unconvinced, unconvinced and unconvinced."
Graham's opinion, however, seemed to be correct.
"I've made a decision about Bret Kavanaugh and only a big allegation can change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Brett denies that allegation with full force," Graham said.
And not every one of them was able to pronounce his name.
It is 36 years old.
I don't think that's going to change anything."
Is there anything they can do to alleviate poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which is being held in New York on Saturday, will see huge stars taking part in it, and the goal is equally great: eradication of global poverty.
This seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival, a crowd of thousands of people will be seen in the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the art of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shaun Mendes, but also to spread the real goal of this festival.
The Global Cities Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international publicity group that hopes to increase the number of people working to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free entry to this site (if you don’t want to buy a VIP entry), the site’s audience had to perform a whole series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering to spread their global eradication goal, emailing a global leader, telephoning or adopting any other meaningful way.
But how successful has the global citizenry been in achieving its goal in the last 12 years?
The idea of organizing a free music festival for people is an honest way to motivate people to act that is just another form of so-called "clicktivism" - in which people think it makes a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has a record of more than 19 million "actions" made by its supporters for different purposes since 2011.
He says his actions have helped global leaders to push for $3,700 million or more in funding commitments and policies, which will impact more than 225 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group signed 390 pledges and declarations, of which at least $1 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the available funds have had a direct impact on the lives of about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Power of Nutrition is a partnership of investors and conveners in the UK, which "helps young children progress to their full potential" and who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, have pledged $35 million in funding to the country to address malnutrition in Rwanda.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of low nutrition as negligible as a grassroots in history," Tracy Ullman, a well-wisher at Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a music festival in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 50 lakh women and children with nutrition assistance.
Answering one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: "It's going to be a big and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the common rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will get success, because our strength has increased as we come together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shaun Mendis, Cardi B, Janelle Mone are among the few performers to perform at this year's festival in New York, which will be co-directed by Deborah-Lee Farnese and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Navy may use "blocks" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Interim Secretary
WASHINGTON: U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinc has said that Washington will use the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching other markets, including the Middle East.
Zinc has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where Russia is acting at the invitation of its legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"The reason they're in the Middle East is because I think they want to trade energy, like the southern part of Eastern Europe," Zink said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to deal with this.
He said the US Navy has the capability to ensure that sea routes remain open to ensure that their energy does not reach the market.
Zinc Consumer Energy Alliance was speaking in front of attendees at an event organised by a group working on the profitability principle. The group calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's role in dealings with Russia and Iran and noted that they were effectively similar.
"The only cost-effective alternative to taking advantage of fuels and using replacement fuels is much less in front of Iran and Russia," he said, calling Russia a "one-trick pony" and calling Russia's economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Trump's administration is trying to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia with a cheaper option for European consumers.
Accordingly, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. According to Trump, Moscow has "captured" Berlin because of that project.
Moscow has reaffirmed that the $1 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 11,000 cubic meters, is a completely affordable project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"Energy cannot be a tool to create pressure and I think we have a common view that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has been heavily dependent on Germany for the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), a leading industry body in Germany, has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"That's a big question for me when our energy supply is interfering with by a third country," Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A Massachusetts lawmaker said that Elizabeth Warren would "carefully" look into the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts lawmaker Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "carefully" look into the presidential election after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed during a town hall in Hollyok, Massachusetts, that he would consider contesting the election.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and recover from the collapse of their government, which includes the act of a woman holding the highest office," Hill said.
"After November 6, I will pay close attention to the presidential election."
Warren argued with Trump during the town hall, saying President Donald Trump was "leading this county in the wrong direction."
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has made a clear statement criticizing Trump and his nominee Kawanu, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was found that most people in Warren's own constituency don't think they should run for president in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, eighty-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said Warren should not contest the election.
Thirty-two percent of the people voted in favor of this measure.
The poll showed former governor Deval Patrick getting 38 per cent support for a possible election and 48 per cent opposition.
Other key democrat names that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 elections include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont member Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin gave the example of Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's meeting.
The 26-year-old track palin spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"Seeing what my stomach is going through and coming back from, I can understand a little bit about the trauma of other families and our soldiers who are suffering from the unwanted effects of PTSD," he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an "open-closed elephant" and said of his son and other soldiers, "When they come back, they are a little different, they come back as a speck, they wonder if their soldiers are here to honor their brothers and all the airmen and every member of the military who have respected the country."
According to Wasila Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence by interfering with a report on domestic violence and possession of drugs.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge of the new Asphalt Policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed the new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday to support one of those who opposed the policy, NBC News reported.
The details of the session suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the full name team policy of the plaintiff in Grace V have not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the children of her violent gang member" abused her, but U.S. officials on July 20 denied her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries facing the problem of gang and domestic violence, where the number of people applying for U.S. asylum is very large.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy led to the withdrawal of a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed asylum seekers fleeing domestic violence to apply for entry into the Asylum.
Attorney General Carl Raisin of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of state, union, and international law."
"All claims for asylum under federal law must be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances of that claim, and such a ban violates that rule," the friend-of-the-court brief said.
In the brief, the lawyers further argued that the refusal of entry while the migrants were detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to become migrants professionals and "supply essential labour"
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to allow victims of domestic violence and gang violence to enter the asylum.
"Assar is available to those who leave their homeland because of fear or persecution because they are members of religion, nationality or a particular social group or political ideology," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The problems that people around the world face on a daily basis -- all the serious problems -- were never expected to be solved in a refugee camp.
Efforts to rescue victims as death toll doubles in search of survivors
The situation was worse for the living.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said, “I feel a lot of stress.”
"Every minute an ambulance carries a dead body.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen picking up their water damaged goods, trying to save anything they would find, returning to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were badly damaged.
Some of the injured, including the leg and shoulder fractured twin Harris, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent acute responses.
The incident took place in the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was buried under the soil of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had gone to the city to get married.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'snatching' with 'propaganda advertisements'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper advertised a four-page ad that outlines the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China scrambled to use the U.S. press to disseminate votes on Beijing.
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congress election, which China rejected - citing a paid supplement to the Chinese daily in Iowa state's largest grocery newspaper Des Moines Register.
Trump has accused China of trying to meddle in the US election, a new chapter in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China, as US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to give advertisements to boost trade, there is a growing trade war between Beijing and Washington, as a result of which they seem to be imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China at the start of the trade war were designed to influence exporters from states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China, who has long been the governor of Iowa exporting large quantities of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote, "China is now doubling down on our own free press by giving publicity ads."
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free journalism by offering paid ads in Des Moines to spread its own opinion," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, the anti-surgeon in the newspapers placed for sale on the streets of Beijing itself is lacking and does not reflect a true reflection of China's differing views on China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
"One of China's leading newspapers refused his offer to publish his article," he said, but did not name the paper.
Analysts have warned that the Republicans are polarising the electorate with the defeat of Cavanaugh before the midterms
Several top Republicans have stood and defended the Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment, and are likely to be hit particularly by women in the upcoming mid-term elections, analysts have warned.
This is a very serious issue, and most Republicans agree with it.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at Maxwell College at Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Rehhar said there were doubts as to whether a proposal put forward by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation at the time would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it even tomorrow and will not forget it in November," said Carin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the Progressive Group, as well as national spokesperson, at the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
"Friday morning, after the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee endorsed Cavanaugh's nomination, demonstrators in the Senate halls said, ""November is coming!"""
"Democrat's enthusiasm and inspiration is flowing with excitement," said Stu Radenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
“People say it’s already at the highest level; it’s true.
But it can grow even further. Especially for unstable female voters in suburban areas, as well as young voters aged 18- to 29-years-old who don't like the president, they usually don't vote."
Even before public evidence detailing her sexual harassment allegations against a Supreme Court nominee by Ford, analysts suggested that Republicans could be hit if they agreed with it.
"This has now become a kind of confusion for the GOP," former Republican National Committee president Michael Steele said earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee's opinion or whether the final vote or whether the cavalry will be elected, it's also about how the Republicans handled the matter and how they treated her," Gay Cecil, director of the Conservatives USA Group, who helped Democrats elect, said in a statement to the news channel.
However, in the backdrop of Ford and Cavanaugh's witnesses, there appears to be a rift among Americans about who to trust, of which Cavanaugh's tendencies are slightly higher.
While 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony, 35 percent said they believed Cavanaugh's testimony either definitively or prospectively.
Also, 38 per cent said that if Cavanaugh lied definitively or potentially during the testimony, only 30 per cent said so in the case of Ford.
The FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, following the request, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that when he was 17, Cavanaugh assaulted him in a drunken state.
Ramirez alleged that while studying in Yale in the 1980s, a Supreme Court nominee at a party revealed his gender to him.
World Wide Web founders are planning to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
World Wide Web researcher Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup that will face competitors like Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the well-known technologist, 'Inrupt', is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's open source platform 'Solid'.
Solid allows users to choose where their data should be stored and which information to give access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that InnerPt's previous aim was "to dominate the world."
"We have to do this," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
This app uses Solid’s technology to help people create their own “Personal Online Data Storage” or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This means that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that it will be entirely in the hands of the user as to what type of information to handle.
The company calls it "personal ability through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring the company resources, processes, and the right skills to make it available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, staff of some developers and a community of volunteer coders who have signed up to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Incorporated website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change that will make all of their business models completely subdued overnight."
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that InnerPt's "the goal is to provide professional energy and ecosystems to help sustain the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has raised an effective voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic for the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vaughn: Celebrating the First World War with Victoria Cross
His hometown celebration was celebrated 100 years later in honor of the Church of England's only clergyman who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior in World War I.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the prize in the September 29, 1918, attacks in Belfast and Lehacourt.
However, four days later, he was shot dead by a brother-in-law who was hiding and never realized that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled a plaque to commemorate him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the chaperone would be unveiled after nearly 100 years of his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vaughan led the battalion through "the canal of Saint-Quentin" with heavy fog and heavy artillery fire from the battlefield.
They then proceeded to the firing line and took forward the line "very bravely" before defeating three detachments, facing the cannons on the battlefield alone.
On October 4, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vaughan was killed by a German sniper about a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "an act that I would never do but bow down to."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also offered floral chakras after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "very honoured to participate in the parade," adding that "the support offered by the people of Bharpur showcased the valour of a genuine hero."
Fans of MMA woke up all night to watch the Beatles 206, but instead they had to watch the Peppa Pig
Imagine you're waking up all night to watch a bellater 206, but you refuse to show the main event.
There were 13 fights in San Jose's Beale, including six fights on the main card, and were to be shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., Gerard Moss and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, instead of showing their coverage, broadcasting Peppa Pig to shock viewers in the UK.
Most of the people who were there were disappointed.
One fan wrote on Twitter that he was "a kind of cruel joke" about children's cartoons.
When asked about broadcasting, "they had to put up a children's program because the content was not broadcastable at 6 a.m. as per government regulation," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and broadcasting at BILTAR.
"Pepe the Pig"", yes."
Scott Cocker, chairman of the beleaguered company, said he would reconsider his schedule to accommodate viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think when I thought of the replay, we thought we could do it," Cooker said.
"But it was six o'clock on Sunday and we couldn't do it until our Sunday, that is, their Monday.
But we are working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of messages coming and going after them and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
If it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We're going to have five fights instead of six as we always do - and we tried to give more to the fans, but we failed.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly's sexuality seems to be "innocent"
The Olympic Diver Tom Daly says he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old-daily said, "Not everyone is like me until I go to secondary school."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of gay people to provide "hope" to others.
He also said that his parents have made him less appreciative of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, took a few months off due to illness.
While attending Laverne's first event as a boycotter, Daly said he felt "a lot less" when he was older than everyone else, because "the likes of boys and girls were not accepted by society."
He said: "Until now, the feeling of inadequacy and separation has become the key things that have given me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show them that I am "someone," so that people wouldn't disappoint them when they really knew about their sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics became a daily high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more and more countries not to consider homosexuality a crime.
He said that he was lucky enough to be able to live freely without fearing the adverse consequences of his actions and wanted others to show him "hope."
The three-time world champion said the men - who met in 2013, fell in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - "were astounding to them."
Daly married an Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you suffered so much at such a young age" - he first participated in the Olympics when he was 14 and then his father died of cancer three years later - said it was difficult to find a person of this age who had seen so much ups and downs.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and Daly said their "whole point of view" had changed.
"If I had asked you last year, I would have said I would have won a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things that are more important than Olympic gold.
"Roby is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 of brain cancer when he was 40.
Daly said his father had not accepted that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I didn't have the courage to tell them you couldn't sit in the first row," he said.
"When they finally took their last breath, I held their hands and I wasn't sure they were invincible until they really stopped breathing and died," he said.
The following year, Delilah took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew there could be no greater feeling than what I had dreamed of all my life - diving into the Olympic Games in front of the home audience," he said.
The same was the inspiration for his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which coincides with him in preparation for the Olympics and still holds a thorn in his side.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Michaelson, who is not in form, was picked as an extra player for the Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will set a new record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get his form back so that the milestone doesn't get hurt.
Michaelson, who has played 12 times in this biennial event in a row, has been captained by Jim Furic as an extra player for Saturday's foreballs and forecourts.
Instead of participating in the actual game, as he's always done for the United States, this five-time important winner focused on the game in the range with the hopes of promoting his day and eliminating the elements that would spoil his game.
Even though he's never been the most straightforward driver in his career, the 48-year-old Michaelson disciplined isn't ideal for such a Lee Golf National course, where the long haul never forgives the wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn't as challenging, Michaelson will face the exact British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has teamed up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans start 12 singles matches with four points behind, in the absence of a good start, Michaelson's match can be very important.
He didn't have much faith in his players.
"Today he fully understands his role, he holds my back and puts his hand around my neck and says he will be ready tomorrow," Farik said.
"There was a lot of confidence in him.
He is the Hall of Fame and has given a lot to these teams before and this week.
I had no idea he was going to play two games.
I had planned to do more, but I decided to do it this way and I think we should go that way.
He wants to be there just like everyone else wants to be."
Nick Faldo is the record holder for the highest number of matches played by Michaelson in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This will probably be the end of his rider's cup career that will never equal the height of his personal records.
Michaelson won 18 matches, lost 20 and went on to win seven, Furyk said, adding that his presence gave the team an intangible value.
"He's funny, he's humorous, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's the best person to be with the team," he explained.
"We're going to have a lot of fun with the players this week.
It's not just a game, it's more than that."
Thomas Bourne, the European captain, knows that the big front will soon disappear.
European captain Thomas Bourne, in his experience, knows that enough lead before the singles matches in the last day's Ryder Cup can easily be reversed in an inconvenient ride.
Dan made his debut in a match in Valderrama in 1997, when the Sev Ballestour-led side took a five-time lead over the Americans but when the matches ended, they were suffocated and won by a margin of only 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won to Valderrama, but only with a slight margin," Bourne said, watching the class of 5-3 victories both Friday and yesterday of 2018, which led to a 10-6 lead in Lee Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in the community that this is not the end.
You'll have to complete it tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until you're on the board.
Our goal is to win the trophy and we will focus on that.
"I've said all the things, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're aware of who's on our other side - the greatest players in the world."
Rejoicing at his players' performance on the difficult golf course, Bourne continues: "I can never go ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's challenge will be different.
It's going to be a different show tomorrow, and it's going to be different.
It is better to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you go there alone, how do you feel about your ability as a golfer?
This is the message that you have to give to the players to show your best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner behind and do the best you can."
Unlike Bourne, Fury in the opposition group will focus on doing better on individual performances than the performances made by his players, with the exception of Rodden Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself faced Europe by a "miracle of the day," before that defeat, as part of the winning team on both sides of that big last-day turnaround.
When asked in 1999 about how his players have progressed on the last day, he replied, "I remember every word in it."
"Tomorrow you have 12 important matches, but you'll have to start as fast as you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Madina.
When he moves in one direction, he puts a lot of pressure on the middle.
We'll set our line-up accordingly and put our players in the trap that you think we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was sent forward on a performance to try to fight back and he wanted to face Rory McLaroy in the top match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, who were at the top half of the other Europeans order.
"I put these players in this order because I thought they would cover all sides," Bourne said.
Germany's new warship has been pushed back
The German navy's latest warplane was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships, but due to poor systems and high prices, it will not be delivered until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman, the operation of the Royal Netherlands-Faiz, a key battleship in the Baden-Wuttenberg-class, has now been postponed to the first six months of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be inducted into the Navy in 2014, but due to worrying post-delivery issues, the future of this ambitious project was left behind.
Four Baden-Wuttenberg-class ships, which were commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the Bremen-class fighter jets.
It is believed to have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft squad and anti-ship missile, as well as some hidden technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - the latest combat errors should be able to be deployed away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay meant that modern warships - allowing Germany to demonstrate power over the sea - had already expired when they entered service, Die Zit reported.
Unfortunately, the F-125 battle came under discussion last year, when German naval officials refused to execute the ship and returned it to the Lom and Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the ship had returned to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
There is not much information about the reasons for the return, but German media said there were several important "software and hardware faults" and that it was not useful to deploy the warship on a war mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuttenberg-class ships would be driven by 120 sailors - half of the manpower on the old Bremen-class fighters.
Also, it was found that the vessel was overloaded which would reduce its performance and would not be possible for the Navy to upgrade it in future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhyland-Faiz" is believed to weigh twice as much as the same-class navy used by Germany in World War II.
Along with defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It has grown from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion - to an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In the wake of the German navy's depletion of power, the problems in the latest battles are of particular importance.
Earlier this year, the head of the defense committee of the German parliament, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the navy was really "finishing ready-to-eat boats."
Officials said the problem is increasing rapidly as time goes by, as the old boats were non-implemented, but new ships did not arrive in their place.
He regretted that no combat errors in the Baden-Wuttenberg-class have the ability to enter the Navy.
National Trustlords steal the secret life of bats
New research was carried out in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use land to search for food.
It is hoped that the new invention will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation work.
Researchers from the National Trust of Scotland will study the general and soprano pipestrells as well as the brown-eared and dobanton whales at the Inverve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special soundprints will be placed at the place of release on the property to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-delivered detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all sounds will determine the frequency of call of the bats and determine what species are doing.
A map and report of natural habitat will be prepared later to create a detailed picture of their behavior on the ground-scale.
NTS's Nature Conservation Advisor, Rob Dever, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of natural habitat are important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help in determining the benefits of the management of natural habitats such as the creation of pasture and how best to maintain the forest land for whales and other related species.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has decreased significantly.
They are endangered due to loss of habitat and natural habitat affected by construction and development works.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as well as some chemical processes of flypapers and construction materials, as well as attacks by pets.
The ants are not really blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch prey.
They use state-of-the-art eco-location techniques to detect insects and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for taking care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has taken the bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect hostels and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization raised Scotland's first and only floated whale reserve at Three Estate in Dumfries and Galway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, said the estate was an ideal territory for him.
"Three is a good area for the bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good natural habitats.
But, there are many things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and on other assets will help us understand more and more what is needed for their growth."
They emphasize the need to investigate bats before maintaining the property as it may lead to the unconscious destruction of a single maternity hostel, which may result in the death of 400 females and babies, and the risk of the destruction of the local population as a whole.
Whales are protected and it is an offence under law to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Watford Conservation Trust, encouraged people to help.
She said: "We have a lot to learn about our bats because we don't know what the population status of many of our species is."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people want to "promote them" using his name.
His lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forwards are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Myorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that she was fined $375,000 to keep her mouth shut about the incident.
The 33-year-old, speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram live video hours after the claim's news, made the news "false news."
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
"What he said today is false news," Ballon d'Or winner said five times in front of the camera.
"They want to use my name.
Its normal.
They are trying to get fame by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm happy and everything is fine," he said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for charges, which, according to him, are "unacceptable reporting of private sector suspicions."
Lawyer Kristin Shertz said the player "can ask for compensation equivalent to the extent of a breach of moral damage, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Myorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he raped her by her ankle.
After the alleged incident, Ronaldo said he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" and "one per cent" disappointed him.
The documents claimed that Ronaldo had admitted to having sex, but said it was by mutual consent.
Myorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photographs of her wounds taken in the hospital, but then she consented to a court-out-of-court settlement because she felt "sweet fear" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now rebuffing the settlement because she is still scared of the alleged incident.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and went to the Italian Giant Juve for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: Britain's 'permanent' remorse for carmakers
Business Secretary Greg Clarke said the UK would "continue to regret" the long-term impact of Brexit on global car manufacturing.
He further said that "a matter of concern" was that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnston near their derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said that a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to border delays.
The Burnston plant - where Toyota's Auris and Avensis were produced - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see that our factory production has stopped," said Marvin Cook, managing director at Burnston, Toyota.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will go if they leave the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the manufacturers is that the supply chain will be jeopardized if the no-deal Brexit takes place.
Toyota's production line runs on the principle of "in time," where spare parts are coming from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for cars manufactured on demand.
If the UK pulls out of the EU without a deal before March 29, there may be ups and downs on the border, and according to the industry, there may be delays for the holidays and they may fall short.
It will be impossible for Toyota to withhold more than one day's worth of goods at its Derbyshire plant, and according to the company, this will lead to a halt in production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's checkered plan for future relations with the EU was "absolutely calibrated so that those checks on the border could be avoided."
"We need a deal to be done. We want a deal that's the best, as I said, for the moment, we don't just want to be successful and happy, but we should be able to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC4's Today programme.
"This evidence is not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, for whom we need to maintain this fact, through which the supply chain will remain extremely successful."
Toyota could not say how long the production would stop, but in the long run, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, of course, affect jobs.
Peter Suvallaris, who worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is a United Union Convener at the plant, said his members were deeply concerned: "In my experience, once their jobs are gone, they will never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be extended, the White House said.
The White House said on Sunday that Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed for another week" as the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, argued.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which includes Russia's election interference, links between Trump's allies and Russia, and the investigation of a possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Rumors have been circulating in Washington for months about whether Trump will or will not show the deputy attorney general the way out, and that could jeopardize Mueller's freedom.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had put in place a wire to record conversations with Trump, through which the president was likely to be removed by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On Monday, he went to the White House to discuss his resignation.
On Thursday, a meeting with Trump was held at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't like" the expulsion of Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was supposed to witness both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation to investigate claims against Kavanaugh, which further prolonged the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present at the Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There is no date set for it, it could be this week, I think looking at other matters going on with the Supreme Court, it could be postponed by another week.
"I've always loved watching the news."
Some journalists argued that Sanders had not given a statement to the White House press since September 10.
Mr. Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders also said that there was no "animosity" about the TV journalists' "performance" for the shortening of the statements. "I'm not denying this fact that it's showy."
He later suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased."
"This president holds more quiz sessions than any of his previous presidents," she said, and then without giving evidence said: "We've seen those figures."
Sanders said: "If journalists had the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me.
"We've been trying to do that a lot, and in the past few weeks you've been doing it before, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, he'll replace giving the press the details," he said.
Trump regularly asks questions while leaving the White House or attending a press conference with high-ranking officials attending an open session or a visit.
There are hardly any press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown cause for negligent and strange presentations to reporters who had gathered.
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff at the NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns.
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude to the country and their desire to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter when the UK had less than six months to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in public services.
In her letter, Freeman writes: "In the full summer, negotiations continued on the exit between the UK and the EU, which are expected to be decided in the coming autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible deal-less situation.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
For this reason, I want to reiterate that irrespective of their nationality, I value the contribution of every member of the staff.
Co-workers in the EU and beyond bring invaluable skills and experience, which strengthen and improve health care operations, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to be here.
He underwent emergency surgery at Abercrombie after he suffered a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers had an emergency surgery on Linebreaker Kristion Abercrombie after they suffered a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores in Saturday's game, the Tennessee Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reedy told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-way left.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there," Reid said.
The trainer and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sidelines before placing her on the stretcher and taking her for further diagnosis.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and that the Tennessee state is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of a redshirt, was playing his first season for Tennessee State after migrating from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had scored a total of five tackles before the current game, making him a total of 18 tackles this season.
More stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers to purchase property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty for purchase of property in the UK and additional money received will be used for homeless under the New Tory Scheme.
This step will pave the way for Corbyns campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
To help the homeless, the treasury is expected to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million a year.
Theresa May will announce today that more stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers to purchase property in the UK and the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an effort to overtake the success of the campaign to attract young voters with a commitment to provide more affordable homes for Jeremy Corbyn and target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will boost the government's campaign to help those who sleep on the streets.
Surcharge- In addition to the high levels of over-tax imposed on other houses two years ago, this would be in addition to the stamp duty introduced and the cost of purchases for hiring would be up to three per cent.
The treasury is expected to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million a year.
According to an estimate, 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK citizens, which increases their prices and makes it more difficult for first-time homebuyers to take steps to buy a home.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost villages” due to foreign buyers, as they spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced weeks after Boris Johnson's stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of buying and keeping land but not using it so that the price of the property increases, and he requested Ms May to remove reservations on affordable homes, so as to remove the "incredulity of homes" in Britain."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of significant housing reforms that include terminating rental control and "without error" eviction.
They also want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the dreams of a better life for the British people - for every new generation.
This means that there is a housing market in the downtown area.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living.
However, it will not be as easy to buy homes for non-residents in the UK as for hard-working British residents as well as for companies based abroad.
For many people, the dream of owning a dream house has become far away, and the ignominy of those who sleep on the street has become a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become the manager of Scotland"
Sanderland owner Jack Ross said his “final goal” was to become Scotland’s manager one day.
Scott, 42, enjoys the challenges of reviving the North-East club, and is three points short of the top spot and third in the league one.
This summer, they have gone to the Stadium of Light, guiding St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
"I got a B-cap and that's all I got," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports.
"But when I was a kid, I grew up watching my father play Scotland at Hopden, and this has always dragged me.
This is only possible if I am successful in my career."
Ross had previously worked with Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio.
The owner of the former Alloa Athletic said there was no fear of following such well-established names in such a big club when their proposals were rejected by Barnsley and Epstein Town.
"The measure of success for me at this moment will be whether or not I will take this club to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, the club is undoubtedly eligible to move into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but if I can get the club back there, I'll probably consider myself successful."
After a period of 15 months of assistant owners and training staff at Hearts in Dumbarton, Ross's management career has only been three years.
They then helped Aloa improve to the third tier from exiting and lead St. Mirren to the Champions Trophy from a chance to get out later in the season.
And Ross says he feels more satisfied than ever with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academics.
He recalls that taking Aloy's burden was "perhaps the way it really was."
"I really think the management was better for me, even more than the game itself."
This sounds strange because I played well, made it a way of life, and enjoyed some of the best places.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
I'm still in a state of stress and stress, but I'm still in a state of stress.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I'm most satisfied because I've been working on my own interests throughout my adult life."

According to the survey, the exact time of drinking is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The heat of summer has boosted Britain's battling, but the pressure on the restaurant chains has increased.
Pubs and bars grew by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, the data showed.
Peter Martin of the Professional Counseling Center CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continuous sunlight and longer participation of England in the World Cup than expected, which also meant a repeat of the earlier June month format in July, with the exception of a further shock from restaurants, the pubz business was 2.8 percent higher.
The restaurant business fell by 1.8 per cent in June and increased further in July.
The pubs and bars that provided more drinks than the restaurant business was shorter did a very strong job.
Even the pubs supplying food, although not as dramatic as those running the restaurant, were also weakened.
People just want to go out to drink.
Sales of beverages in well-managed pubs and bars grew by 6.6 per cent in the same month, while consumption of food was down by three per cent.
Paul Neumann, a rest and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "We are seeing these results as a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Where there is a question of sales in the external market, the weather and important social or sporting events are the most effective factors.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are struggling, though a 4.8 per cent decline over the previous year will be particularly painful due to the current spending pressure.
"Only time can tell if the medium temperatures we experienced in August can provide the much-needed relief for those who did not want to come during a long hot summer, when this was a difficult period for those who sold food."
Pubs and restaurants saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, including newly opened, indicating a slowdown in brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, whose combined turnover is more than 9 billion pounds and has established industry standards, oversees sales of 47 driver groups and analyzes their performance data by collecting and analyzing them.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents.
A survey has revealed that one in five children — some are 11 years old — has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase of "fake insta" pages.
The news has caused a lot of concern that sexual content is being posted in it.
Twenty percent of students say that their “main” account is meant to be shown to parents.
One in five children – some even 11 years old – are creating social media accounts, which are kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed that “fake Insta” accounts are growing rapidly – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has caused a lot of concern that sexual content is being posted in it.
Twenty percent of students say that their “main” accounts are meant to be shown to parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother came to Bhola when she first saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site when the girl asked others to "rape me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Council of Headmasters and Headmasters of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two identities, and half of them admitted having a private account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "So many teenagers are eager to create online places that feel extremely distressed to see their parents and teachers not being able to find them."
Doyle will be the voice of the players on the Scottish athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most famous track and field players, and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who have conducted the game to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Ailidh has great respect in the community of Scottish, UK and global players and we are confident that bringing them on board will greatly benefit the players in Scotland," said BT.
"I'm excited to be a voice for the players and I hope I can contribute and guide the game in Scotland," Doyle said.
At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, the man who won the 200 and 400m of his four Olympic gold medals has now become a regular BBC pundit, unable to walk after a transit ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctor said I'll be fine and I'll tell you just how long it takes.
It was exhausting work, but I was completely healed, learned how to walk again, and today I'm exercising on the move!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
An online poll of breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows sparked controversy.
An online poll that compares breast-feeding women to milk cows displayed by a breast-pump company has sparked controversy.
Launching the pump, considered the world's first "silently usable breast pump," consumer tech company Elvine released a new music video ad showing the freedom of breastfeeding mothers.
The four real mothers dance on the rhythm of the song in a cow-filled room as follows: "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you don't notice, they're not idle, but my breasts."
The chorus continues to sing: "Pump this, pump it, I'm filling the babies, pump it, pump it, I'm pulling my ladies' milk."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has sparked an online controversy.
The video, with over 77,000 views and hundreds of neighbors, received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom were of the opinion that the dairy industry's "trouble" was too shallow.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision."
With the exception that their baby is taken away from them within a few days of giving birth, they become pregnant just like us and give birth to a baby to give milk," she wrote.

Another commented: "Obviously, it's distressing for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't they use breast pumps to advertise to mothers who keep their babies?"
Another wrote: "This is an irrelevant advertisement."
While others supported the ad, one woman admitted that the song was "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would have taken one.
I felt like a pumpkin.
It’s a bit crazy, but I think it’s the right thing to do.
It's an unusual product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This fun ad is for mothers who pump (usually in their workplace or bathroom) and they feel like cows."
This advertisement is not an advertisement appreciating or appreciating the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women were dancing in their braces.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the perspective of many women who feel like cows to women who use breast-pumps.
However, the Elvi pump is completely silent, does not have wires or tubes and sits precisely in the nursing bra, which allows women freedom of movement, can hold children, and can even go out during pumping.
Anna Bellarin, a partner at Mother's and ECD, expressed the view: The Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, which needs to be launched in an open and stimulating manner.
By showing similarities between the lactating women and the cows in the hospital, we had to bring to light the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pumps are offering us, displaying in an interesting and relevant way, breast pumping and all its challenges.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children was seen using the product for designer Marta Zakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrant children detained increased partially, as the harsh language and policies presented by the Trump administration made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves are documented immigrants, and when coming forward to adopt a child, they are afraid to risk their own ability to sustain themselves in that country.
When the Federal Authority announced in June that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints, and that the data would be handed over to immigration authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Matthew Albens testified before Congress, in which he said the agency arrested some people who had applied to sponsor minors who were not accompanying him.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"Around 80 percent of people who are sponsors or have family members of sponsors live illegally, and a large part of them are involved in criminal acts.
"We're going to continue to support these people," Albany said.
To speed up the process of children, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to shelter workers, that some of them will have to appear in court for a month, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, since they were taken into custody.
Many will be present through video conference instead of appearing in person to present their petitions for legal status before the Migration Judge.
Those who are unable to help will be immediately expelled from the country.
According to reports from shelter workers and mechanisms in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more anxious or desperate they may become, which can lead to violent tendencies or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that those problems grow massively in large facilities like Tornillo, where, due to the large number of children there, the neglected children are found to be extremely struggling.
He added that the children being taken to Tent City are getting additional trauma to children who are already struggling because they are not given time to prepare emotionally or to bid farewell to their friends.
Syria asked the US, French and Turkish forces to leave the country immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Muallem said that although the country's war is now in its eighth year, Syrian refugees must return to their homeland.
Mauleem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign military presence on Syria's soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism is illegal, and "will be dealt with appropriately."
"They should leave the country immediately and there should be no conditions for that," he said.
Mauleem stressed that the "war on terror in Syria is almost over", which has killed 360,000 people since 2011, and left millions homeless.
He said that "all the Syrian terrorists of the terrorist group and "until any foreign existence is cleared, Damascus will continue to fight this holy war."
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arabs who oppose the Kurdish military and President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 French troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
When asked about the surrenders, Mauleem said that the situation was favourable for them to return, but blamed "some foreign countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears, which led to the surrenders being kept away.
We urge the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"It's the people who are doing politics that should be purely humane."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up buffer zones in Idlib's last important rebel stronghold has given journalists an opportunity ahead of political hegemony.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoids large-scale attacks on the Syrian province by the Russian-backed army, where three million people live.
However, Mauleem stressed that there was a "clearly set deadline" for the deal and hoped that the military's action would target jihadists, including fighters in the Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaeda, and would be overthrown with the roots.
UN Ambassador Stephane de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee formed by government and opposition members will be held soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Maulemani put forth the conditions for the inclusion of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to reviewing the current constitution's rules and warned against any interference.
Trump will win the second round.
According to that logic, as many liberals might have expected, impeachment and an unpleasant incident would put their president's term to a premature end, but if not, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020.
There is no doubt that "the most dramatic presidential battle to date will be the final battle!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's prime-time ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nelson, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, which number increased from 1.7 million four years ago, and was topped by MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" cable ratings, which were watched by 3.5 million viewers on Major News Knights.

Ignorance is a luxury, which can only be afforded to an audience with privilege.

I'll never see Superman again.
"Brent Montego Mary, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Poin Stars", said of Trump's show's changing cast and turning points in the daily storyline (a fight with the NFL by praising Kim Jong-un), "part of what they do, I think, is something they provide every night through a reality show."

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's house this week, there was a nice sunshine and 80 degrees of temperature outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he had been caught watching MSNBC by recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from himself, not from Brett Kavanaugh, who is ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court is in jeopardy.

During the mid-term elections, the money flows out of the house.
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th is witnessing a money flood, responsible for which, due to the re-emergence of the districts of the Congress, two candidates stood in the race for the same seat.
It recently reinstated Democratic Republican Conor Lamb in the suburban Pittsburgh district - who had won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stood in front of the second candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who was currently representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which was largely occupied with the new 17 Vyasa.
After Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally made in favor of the Republicans, the maps were reconstructed.
The race for the new 17th began with an economic struggle between the main party's economic side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow margin of victory in the special election in March, widely seen for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans held the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
Yesterday, the Democrats gave a little bit of a heads-up.
U.S. backs China, decides to punish El Salvador, then reverses decision
Diplomats noted that after a slight withdrawal from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump had an intimate meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, until he was evicted as a partner of the Trump Organization Management Team.
State Department officials said earlier this month that U.S. Chief of Diplomatic Missions had been recalled "from a recent decision by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama not to recognize Taiwan."
But he was only considering imposing penalties against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the country in Central America because of the high number of unemployment and murders in the country.
As the internal meeting moved forward, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar summit last year, which was seen as a step in an effort to curb immigrants coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration has made it clear that it wants the council to move forward and effectively end the idea of any penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, which has now been decided in October and mid-March, in a signal to convene the administrative sector, the diplomats said.
And all three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, without any new harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to give details of the talks, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal discussions on terms of anonymity.
His accounts were confirmed by an external analyst, who was close to the administration and, as well, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Practice History
The next inevitable event could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now in the public record with ample evidence.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation in the direction of whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspires with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will see himself facing responsibilities in that institution, when he is ready to go to the polls again, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his counterparts.
There are plenty of them, and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's defeat is inevitable - or that his counterpart's defeat in Europe is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices that will affect how long the conflict can last.

The study of history became central to the underlying issues of such dissent and accelerated or delayed the unending march of democracy.
The United States is now confronted with some of these issues.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Chairman General Rod Rosenstein, who was handling the sources of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since the newspaper reported that it has been in trouble since last year, Rogenstein had given the impression of secretly recording the president and that he was not fit for office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the account of The Times is incorrect.
How would we react if Brett Kavanaugh's recent FBI investigations were not complete or justified - or he was decided to go to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonesty?
Moreover, will we hold the mid-term elections for the Congress and hold Mr. Trump responsible for it?
If we fail to do so, our democracy will be destroyed for a long time.

Despite a clear idea of how to care for the participants in the survey, some people were talking to their family members.
Nearly half of people across the country said they were talking about long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 per cent of the respondents talked about it.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they are not taking any steps to communicate this," said Holly Schneider, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Start from here.
Talk to your mate and your children about this: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you haven't told them your wishes in advance.
Consult with your advisor about where and how to take care of it and discuss it with your family, so that the choice of these things can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Talk to your financial advisor to find out how you can make money.
Your funds choices for long-term maintenance may include a traditional long-term maintenance insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy or a self-insurance with your own assets to help cover these expenses.
Take out your legal documents: Complete the legal matters before the time.
Get a health-care proxy so you can hire a trusted person to care for your medical care and make sure that the professionals have followed your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your financial matters.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said.
Due to the shock of contact, the relief officials could not get any information from Dongla Regency, which falls in the northern part of Palu and which is at the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu after the disaster.
The important facts at Palu and Dongla on Sulawesi Island are as follows:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongla is a region 300 km (180 mi) from the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, a province under the administrative jurisdiction, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The nickel mine is also important in the region, but it is more concentrated in Moroville, which is on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Donghala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the Tsunami struck West Dongle, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by an earthquake.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Pratt in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people, half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A powerful earthquake hit the western wall of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Neas, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, breaking the south wall, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Mentawaibet in Sumatra, creating a 10-metre-high Tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: PD Jaya Regency in Aceh was struck by a shallow earthquake, which destroyed much of it and created an atmosphere of fear, which reminded people of the terrible earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was reported, but more than 100 people were killed in the building collapse.
2018: Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok is hit by a major earthquake, killing more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists were stranded for some time.
Sara Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Former Alaska governor and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son, Trek Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin, from Wasla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and on suspicion of interfering with domestic violence reports and protesting arrests, according to a report released by Alaska state authorities.
According to the police report, when a woman relative tried to call the police to report the crime, he took away the phone from her.
Palin is being remanded to the Mart-Su pretrial facility and placed on a $500 non-bailable letter, KTUU reported.
In a media report, he was produced before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when he was asked.
Palin will face a third-degree offense, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony in which he was sentenced to one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Pauline.
His mother, Sarah Palin, had called the police to lodge a complaint about the attack.
The case is currently pending in the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in domestic violence crime reports, and possessing intoxicating substances related to incidents.
A friend of hers said that he stabbed her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veterans after she linked her son's PTSD to violent transactions originating from the service in Iraq in 2016.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake in Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication have been cut off in the coming days and the death toll is expected to rise.
The epicentre of the quake is located in the north-eastern part of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
The video of the incident has gone viral on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palamu to celebrate when the tsunami hit the coast.
Coalition prosecutors demand death penalty for suspected New York terror attack
The federal prosecutor in New York, Syflo Cypov, is seeking a death sentence for the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people—the state has not imposed such a stringent punishment for federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old used a rental home depot truck in October to attack a two-wheeler near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan.
In order to qualify for death penalty for the purpose of awarding a death sentence filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors have to prove that Cypov "saved" those eight victims and "saved" serious bodily injury.
According to the court documents, the death penalty can be awarded in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury had imposed the 22-year-old-accused Cypov, who was charged with eight counts of murder with the help of racketeering, with federal prosecutors and motor vehicles charged with the destruction of the vehicle in an organized crime case.
Describing what Saipov had done as 'horrific, cruel and humiliating', the lawyer said the attack requires 'significant planning and forewarning'.
"Seflo Habibulvavik Cypov has injured the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlis, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagano's injuries, injuries and friends.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's Southern District Session has been a decade behind the death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death in a New York federal trial for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, Rosenberg was killed by an electric chair.
According to court documents, Cypov, a native of Uzbekistan, exhibited a lack of repentance during the days of the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge sheet, Cypov told investigators that after watching the video of him on his mobile, he was motivated to attack.
Police said he was also asked to keep the flag in his hospital room.
He also pleaded not guilty to the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "totally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the death penalty should be determined, accepting any demand for life imprisonment is to aggravate the suffering of all those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Cypov's defence team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to give death sentence.
Nigel Farage should be in charge of negotiating Brexit, Tory said.
During the protest, Nigel Farage vowed to form an "Organization of the People's Army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should have access to Eurosceptics - as suggested by Theresa May's MP, they should have access to negotiating channels with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bonn told the crowd in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have been 'out of it' by now.
However, Ramen Torres supporters have made it more clear that they are facing hurdles in joining the group of Ms May as they staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
Even in the storm of criticism from Brexiters, reminers and EU, they have to learn to keep up with their checkers promise.
The Allies say that despite opposition, they should try to establish relations with Brussels and put pressure on the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between the plans they put forward.
Mr. Bonn made it clear before the Leave Means Leave Rally in Solihull that he wanted to terminate the 'relationship with the checkers'.
He also suggested that he should take Mr. Faraz along with him and give him the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
If they had the money, we'd be out of here," he said.
Wellingboro MP said: "I'll stand by Brexit, but we have to get the checkers out."
On his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not take part in the World War to get a second place."
We need laws in our country.
Denying that the referendum has changed since the 2016 election, Mr. Bonn said: "The British people have changed their minds, their demands, and now they want to live in the same system.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also present at the march. Speaking to reporters, she said: “All I will say is: PM, listen to the people.
There is anger among the general public about the checkers, the opposition will not vote for them, our party and our activists who have chosen us to the highest position have created this path.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please
In a clear message to Smt. May, she stated: 'The Prime Minister can hold his office only when he retains his promises.'
Addressing the Morcha, Mr. Faraz said that politicians who want to betray the 2016 election must be held accountable.
It is a matter of trust between our people and our political class.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we want to tell them today, at this moment, here that we will not let you do this.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd here, he said: "I think you should teach this lesson to our politicians who are on the path to betray Brexit."
"We are building an army of the people of this country, the same army that will bring us to victory in Brexit, and until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom, this army will not be healthy."
Remainers marched to Birmingham two hours before a two-hour march in the city center.
A group of activists set up a group to stage a series of demonstrations against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, who is considered a friend of the Labour Party, held the Conservative Party on security issues in the party app as the conference began.
These are the same people who are telling us that the IT system is running well and all these technologies will lead to Canada Plus, there will be peace on the border, there will be free trade without Ireland border and many such things, he said.
This is all made up.
There is no such thing as a proper Brexit,” he added.
Warren is going to seriously consider contesting the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider contesting the presidential election after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, Massachusetts Democrats were talking about their future plans during a townhall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren is contesting the election against GOP State Representative Goff DL in November, who was also co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is being said that he will contest against Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting, which Trump held on Saturday, was the 36th meeting with voters who had adopted the Townhall method.
One of the members asked him if he would like to run for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to keep up with our troubled government, and it's also meant to be the highest-ranking woman," Warren said.
Man arrested for murder of LSU's Sims
Baton Rouge, L.A., police said on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect who shot and killed basketball player Wyde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department said the 20-year-old Deteon Simpson was arrested at an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting and asked to identify the person seen in the video footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University campus on Friday morning.
"Wyde Sims was shot in the head and died," Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told the media.
Viadey tried to save his friend and Simpsons shot him.
Simpson, during the police interrogation, admitted that he was at the spot at the time of the incident, that he had a gunman and that he had fired at Yyde Sims.
Simpson was easily arrested by the police and has been detained at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6-inch junior basketball player, Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games to date, with 10 of them starting last season. His average rate was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton beats Sabastian Vettel to clinch world title
It was only on Saturday that Valtteri Bottas qualified with more points than Lewis Hamilton that it became clear that Mercedes's order will now be important in the tournament.
Bottas had a good start from the poles, taking Hamilton's place on the first two turns, he almost knocked out Hamilton, so it was time for Vettel to beat his own teammate.
Vatel left Hamilton at the end of the pack in the traffic and went to Pitts first. In fact, this action should have been decisive.
Mercedes then rebounded to the back of Vettel's position, but after a few very interesting moments, Hamilton went ahead and the Ferrari driver had to be reluctantly cleared the insides for a third-place double move.
Max Versetpain started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh in the first round of the competition, colored on his 21st birthday.
However, he later took over most of the competition and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth spot to complete the race.
In the 44th lap, however, Rykonen finished fourth, making it impossible for him to increase his speed.
It was a really hard day. Waltery did a great job and he is very polite.
The team has done a fantastic job in getting one," Hamilton said.
This is really bad
However, Senator Dianne Feinstein has denied allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, alleging that he did not bring out a letter from Ford.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what is going on in the Senate shows how much "selfish, vicious and liar" people have become.
"What's been going great in the Senate for the last few days, what could happen there... When you look at the anger there, you see these people are angry, angry, selfish, and liars."
“You look at the headlines, she leaks and then says... oh... I didn’t.”
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dude, did you get rid of it?
He remembers his answer... did you leak these documents... "What, what did you say?"
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Yeah, wait a minute.
"We didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it," he said.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that it had been leaked from his office.
I have not concealed the allegations of Dr Ford, but I have not leaked his letter to the committee, The Hill Reporter reported.
They asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it.
However, his denial was not of much interest to the president. He said in a Saturday night meeting: "I tell you, this is a very bad thing."
Maybe they didn't, but it was the worst I've ever seen."
Defending the Supreme Court representative of three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct, the president said these Democrats are using the allegations for their own benefit.
They need to do something to regain power.
They don't care who they are, they don't care who they are, they don't care who they are, they don't care who they are, they don't care who they are, they don't care who they are, they don't care who they are, they don't care who they are, they don't care, they don't care, they don't care," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars returned with a 5-3 defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier scored the first goal of the match.
Before Dwyer regained the lead, Jordan Cowney and Mike Sullivan had equalled the hosts.
Franco Boukard equalized Dundee and then scored Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's goal to help the team win.
For Adam Keefe, this was his third loss in the Elite League this season. He came back from a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match between the two teams this season. The Giants had won the last three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35th minute, four minutes before the start of the game, with the help of Kendall McFaul. Bovillier again doubled the lead with the help of David Rutherford.
Sullivan scored in the 13:10th minute to keep the hosts on track, followed by Mate Markardt in the 15:16th minute to equalise.
At the end of the first session, Dwyer scored his second goal to help the Giants regain their lead in the first break.
"The hosts once again set the tone and in the 27:37th minute Bokard scored a power play goal to equalise the team again."
Cowney and Charles Corkern came together to help Nielsen score goals and Dundee got the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second season.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, will now play their next match against Milton Keynes on Friday at their home ground.
Air traffic controller dies after quake hits plane
The aircraft, which was carrying hundreds of passengers, was flown to Indonesia after it was confirmed that it had flown safely.
At least 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful quake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The entire area has been devastated by the strong earthquake and many people have been trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
The control tower at the Mutiara Cis Al Jufri airport in Palu was shaken by the quake. The 21-year-old, Anthony Gunung Agung, refused to leave his seat even as other colleagues fled the scene for fear of Ziva.
At that time, Batik Air Flight 6321 was on the runway and did not move from its place to make it fly safely.
He then jumped out of the vehicle after he realised that the traffic was coming down.
He later died in hospital.
The decision may have saved the lives of hundreds of passengers, Air Navigation Indonesia spokeswoman Johannes Sirat told ABC News in Australia.
We had equipped a helicopter at Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost the plane this morning before it landed.
“We were shocked to hear this,” he said.
Meanwhile, fears that the death toll could cross the 1,000-mark are on the rise, the emergency management agency says, adding that it is difficult to reach all parts of the cities of Dongala, Singi and Butong.
"The death toll is likely to rise further as many bodies are still buried under the debris and we are not able to reach there," a spokesman for the agency said.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated the city of Palu. Mass burials will be held in the city of Palu on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are supplying relief and essential supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: "The bodyguards are bringing the dead bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
"There are small markets all over the place."
The head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors but we don't know what they'll do there."
This situation is already very sad, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete every task related to expatriation."
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane crashed in the Gulf.
The airline, which operates a plane that crashed in the Gulf of Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean, now says one passenger is missing after the crash, adding that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated.
According to a report published by Air Niugini, the company had not found a male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
"We are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigative agencies to trace the man,"" the airline said."
When asked for more details such as the age or nationality of the passenger, the airline did not immediately respond.
Locals helped rescue passengers and staff after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on the wrong island.
Seven people were taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six of the passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and are in stable condition, the airline said.
The exact cause of the crash is yet to be ascertained.
The aircraft landed before reaching the runway, the US Navy and the airline said.
Some of the aircraft seem to have gone overboard.
American traveller Bill Jensen said the plane went down a lot.
Jensen said: "It was a good thing.
Janice said he and the other passengers got out of the sinking plane by way of emergency exit and walked through the waist water.
He said that the crew of the aircraft were panicking and shouting and also stated that they had sustained minor injuries on their head.
The U.S. Navy said that some of the crew members were involved in the rescue operations. Before the plane sank, they were transported from the inflatable boat to the shore.
In the last two years, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes, according to the Aviation Safety Network.
The incidents of the woman being burnt alive have been reported by analysts.
The government on Saturday concluded its arguments in a scuffle over a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014 in Mississippi.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, told the jury how she and the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Teles, had checked the cellphone records to find out exactly what happened the night she died.
Rowlett said he had collected the location data of several cellphones to determine if Teles was with her that evening when Chambers died. Teles had earlier claimed that he was not with her that evening. Clarion Ledger reported this.
As per the available data, his cellphone appears to have been near the cellphone of the Chambers at that time, and Teles said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at that time. Police then went to Sanford to talk.
Sanford appeared before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
The prosecutors asked Sanford if he had been in a Sanford truck that night, and he said he was lying about it.
Another difference is that we knew her two weeks before Chambers died, Teles said.
From the cellphone records, it appears that they had started getting to know each other only a week ago.
After the death of the chambers, Teles deleted her messages, calls, contact information on her phone.
"He took her out of my life," she said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The case is expected to be heard on the same day, the judge said.

Another black person?!
A nun in New York courted a couple for dropping out of work on the basis of a "racist" message
"A Nanny couple in New York is being dragged to court for ""misbehaving in a racist manner"" after her mother wrongly sent her a message complaining that she was another black person."
He has denied the allegation of apartheid by the couple, claiming that the suit is a form of "cash" demand.
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, disapproved of the fact that she was black when Naveen Bai first came to work in 2016.
"NASSSSSSSSSSSS is also another black man," wrote Plasco-Flaxman, who sent a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending this message to her husband, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing the confusion, the 'disappeared' Pavsco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris herself. Her previous nanny was African-American and she was doing bad things. So she also said that she wants a Filipino nanny now. The New York Post reported this.
Smt. Morris was paid for a day's work and was later sent home by Uber.
Ms. Morris is now dragging the couple to court for a pay cut for work. She has been demanding a compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months. She was hired with a promise to stay full-time. However, no agreement has been reached.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday. "I know this is racist," she said.
The couple has refuted the claim of the concerned being racist. It is no longer possible to put their trust in Smt. Morris on account of injury. In such a situation, the couple has contended that it is only by holding the reasoning to remove them from work.
"My wife sent them what she didn't want to say."
It's not racist.
"We're not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the post.
"But if you treat someone with cruelty, will you hand them over to the children in the hands of the same person?"
Do you want to give your baby to that person?
It's not possible."
Plasco, alleging that the suit was a "type of rigging", said that his wife had given birth to the child just two months ago and that she is presently in "extremely difficult situation"."
"Does anyone follow someone like this?"
"This is not a very good thing," said Plasco, an investment banker.
Though the court case is still pending, the public court has left the couple with a scathing comment on social media.
This has been revealed in a new letter to the editors of Paddington worrying that readers will not be able to accept the idea of a speaking bear.
Karen Yankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to understand what the state of mind of the person who read it for the first time before it was published."
It's interesting to know what we know about the enormous success of Paddington now."
Inspired by a young bear in the toy industry working as a cameraman in the BBC, the father who wrote books for children would have remained optimistic even if the book was rejected, she says.
She describes Paddington as “a very important member of our family.” She also said that her father was very proud of the success she had achieved in the end.
“They were so quiet, they never played their own team,” she said.
"But Paddington really did exist for them, so if our son had some success, we would be proud of him even if he didn't do it.
I think that's the way they see the success of Patterson.
It was his creation and his imagination, and he always credited it to Paddington."
My daughter was on the phone and I had to call her.
After lading, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur Two Hospital in Nice where the doctors tried to save her but it was in vain.
"Nad was calling me on a regular basis and telling me that the situation is very bad, she doesn't think it will come out of this," said Saeedna-Laparoz.
"Then I got a call from Nadda and he said she's going to die in the next two minutes and I want to say goodbye to her.
And I made it clear to her.
I said, "I love you, baby.
I'll be with you soon too.
I will be with you.
The effect of the medications given to her to continue pumping her heart was gradually decreasing and all her systems were shut down.
She died a few days ago and everything was gone.
I just wanted to sit back and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because there were so many families and people around me.
I really had to save myself.”
Finally, Ednan-Laparous sat on the plane with other passengers, mourning the loss of their daughter.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I was in tears, and my eyes were constantly tingling.
This is a bit difficult to explain but while on the plane, I was feeling empathy for Nad.
I needed to understand his love.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in distress post cards to avoid suicides from bridges.
Two women who have lost their loved ones due to suicide are now working to prevent the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspirational messages and phone numbers written cards on the Welsh Bridge. People can get help by calling these phone numbers.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler had been suffering from depression since she was 13 years old and ended her life at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to have to deal with me every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lidney. Her son was an emerging chef with a smile that would put a smile on her face.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always had a smile on his face."
But he quit his job before he died, because "he lived really long."
Tyler committed suicide in 2014, when his brother, 11, saw him dead.
Mrs. David said: "I continue to feel as if it will have an indirect impact on her."
Mrs. David made the cards, "To make these people aware that there are people you can go to, people you can talk to. They can be any of your friends.
“Don’t be silent – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years. Mrs. Humphreys lost her 15-year-old partner Mark. Shortly after the death of her mother, she also ended herself.
"He never said he was disappointed, he didn't say anything," she said.
"After two days of Christmas, we started to notice a slight change in his attitude.
He didn't have any money in his pocket on Christmas Day - he avoided staring at them when the kids were opening their gifts."
She said her death was a huge shock for her family, but we got out of it.
This led to our split.
All we have to do is keep fighting and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is a little off as the FBI began investigating
"I thought, if we really got something like what he was asking - the investigation to be completed within a certain period of time, the limited opportunity - maybe we could bring a bit of unity," Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared he was "defeating" the committee's Partition Gridlock habit.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It is only because of their time.
There are only six weeks until the midterm elections, which are on November 6 - if the Republicans' performance is as bad as expected, their efforts to send a man to the country's highest court will be very weak.
George W. Bushni picked up the phone to call the Senator to form a plank of supporters of Mr. Kavanaugh. Mr. Kavanaugh was working for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him Mr. Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, when Mr. Bush was his own secretary.
What will happen to the FBI?
There are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break his parity and retain it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of infiltrators under the leadership of Kim
South Korean lawmakers say the number of infiltrators from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Referring to data from the South Unification Ministry, Park Byong-sung said there were 1127 intruders last year compared to 2,706 intruders in 2011.
Mr Park said that the tight seam control between North Korea and China and the extra money being taken from human smugglers was an important factor.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Many North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many people live in China, which has a large border with North Korea, and crossing the border is easier than crossing the desolate zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers infiltrators as illegal immigrants and forcibly sends them back.
Relations between the North and the South - although still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on non-use of nuclear power.
This came after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore in June to discuss a wide range of issues on the nuclear-free Korean dynasty.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho slammed the U.S. sanctions over a lack of progress.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we will not be able to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "beacon" and says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-directed candidate Brett Kavanaugh "behaved" and said he had been incapacitated for some time to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I can't do anything about it, but I think if a woman did it, they would call her 'Bevan'," Pelosi said Thursday about Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
When Kavanaugh started talking, he became very brotherly, talking about his family and high school days, he was crying sometimes and sometimes he was choking his neck.
He accused the Democrats of "coordinated murder of a strange and character" in the 2016 presidential election to express anger over Hillary Clinton's loss.
Pelosi has stated that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because he proves that he is biased in the case of Democrats.
“I think they have disqualified themselves from their statements and following Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
Asked if Pelosi would raise questions on his legitimacy if Kavanaugh was appointed and the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"All I'm going to say is that if they're not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, they're not just in the Supreme Court, they're not in the court they're in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is presently a Judge in the Appellate Circuit Court of the D.C.
Pelosi said that as Democrats, they are concerned about the Kavanaugh Affordable Care Act, or Roe v. Wade's handling of possible claims against them, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh left out some questions about whether he would abide by the Supreme Court's decision.
"This is not the time to expect a partisan man to go to court and hear from you, "or how nice it is!"," Pelosi said.
Women need to use their weapons.
This right voice has been raised, several months and years have been reversing and she had no choice but to cry.
"When we get angry, we cry," Mrs. Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think this is normal, what do you think?"
She added, "The woman who worked for me as an executive somewhere gave me a lot of support, she said she was angry that she would cry too, but she developed a technique that when she started crying and crying, she used to say to the man who was talking, 'Think that I'm crying because I'm sad.'
I got angry."
And then he continued to say.
And I thought it was amazing."
Tears are allowed as a downer of anger because there are fundamental misunderstandings about them.
One of the strongest memories I had about my early job was in a male-dominated office, where I was once seen crying uncontrollably, with an old woman - a cold blood manager who always feared me - caught my neck and dragged me down to the wall of the ghetto.
"I'll never let you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy for that.”
Petrisia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat named Monkey Business on an extramarital affair, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed and wondered why we should not stand for the presidential election.
“It wasn’t a deliberate decision,” she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There are already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they want is another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowwhite and the Seven Dorfs."
"Mohammed was reluctant to raise those funds because of the delay and therefore decided that she would not get into the fight until she received $2 million."
It was a losing battle.
She said she received $250 from her friends.
"Do they think I'm relieved?" she thought to herself.
He was so overwhelmed with emotions when he announced that he would not start a formal campaign - his gratitude for the people who supported him, his enthusiasm for a system that made it difficult to raise money, and his anger at delegates and sexuality - instead of targeting voters.
"You might have thought I was heartbroken," Ms Schroeder said of the symbolism the newspapers gave her.
"You might have thought that Clenix was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I was going to write on my gravestone.
"Why did she cry?"""
How the U.S. and China Can Benefit from the Trade War
Experts say the trade war between the U.S. and China is no sign of an end to the war, and that the long-term gap between these countries could be beneficial to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump has issued his first warning on tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
With new tariffs hitting the $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value this week, all goods coming from China to the United States are effectively taxed.
Beijing has repeatedly resisted import duties of five to ten percent of its most recent $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to keep pace with the US, and soon the world's largest economy will never be forgotten.
Washington's withdrawal would be to meet the demands, but a public greeting to the US would be very disturbing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its part properly, China will be able to provide positive support in the long run by reducing the reciprocity of the two economies due to pressure from the US trade war.
In fact, the economic loophole that would trigger an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing is more dangerous than what people have previously accepted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia, a think-tank at the Center for New American Security.
The Syrian government says it is "ready" to repatriate the refugees.
Syria is willing to voluntarily repatriate refugees and has sought help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mulayem said the situation in the country was improving.
"The progress made in the fight against terrorism today makes the situation in our region more stable and safe," he said.
In order to improve the normal situation, the Government has started rehabilitation of the areas destroyed by the terrorists.
All the conditions are now ready to voluntarily return the refugees who have left our country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people still need philanthropy in the country.
Al-Mulayem said the Syrian government will help rebuild the country that has been devastated.
But he insisted that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the armed aiding countries.
The European Cup of Champions in Paris
In Le Golf National, outside Paris, France, the European Union defeated the United States in the 2018 Ryder Cup final by 16.5 to 10.5 points.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Denmark captain Thomas Buzzer won the toss and elected to bat first against the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson fought in many competitions, dipping his T-Shot into the 16th hole to face Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari became the first of four players to shine in all of his matches and took a 5-0 lead since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Denmark's Thorbourne Oleson, the lowest-ranked player in the European Union, threw out Jordan Spiths 5-4.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, fell 2-1 to England's Ian Polter, who may have played for the final Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, an experienced eight-Rider Cup champion, became Europe's all-time winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't cry, but I can't do anything.
This is a tough year.
Thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy that I'm able to help," said Emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his country colleague John Reham, who on Sunday overtook US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles game.
The 23-year-old said: "I feel incredibly proud to be able to beat the man I grew up with, Tiger Woods."
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
"A strange statistic was reported by one of the greatest players of all time, with Jack Nicklaus winning only 14 major titles."
With the exception of high-capacity golfers Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, the USA team traveled the entire weekend to find Fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyck said of his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these people, they fought.
This morning, we tried to put pressure on the European Union.
We fought hard.
Salute to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 players played well.
"We will match the team again, I will work with the PGA and Ryder Cup committee of the United States, and we will move on.
I love these two guys and I'm proud to be a part of them.
You have to appreciate them.
We got out.”
