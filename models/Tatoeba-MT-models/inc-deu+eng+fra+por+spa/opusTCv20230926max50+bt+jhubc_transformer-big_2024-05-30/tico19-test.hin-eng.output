Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly in all countries at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparations for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the group of pneumonia cases with unknown diagnosis-science was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China, reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% have an observation of a critical illness requiring serious care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, there was further geographic expansion of COVID-19 and currently the COVID-19 pandemic has moved beyond this country in the rest of the world.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported as per the WHO case definition in the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date.
Achieving cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, the National and Regional Health Authority and the World Health Organization (WHO) count the reported COVID-19 cases from each country is updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated the brief cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases of 14 days taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also demonstrated the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as on 15th March 2020 as compared to Italy for the period 31st January - 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and UK
The 14-day short cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and across the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and grew sharply around February 28, 2020 (Supplementary Content).
This was mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the same trend was observed in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (Supplementary Content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK in the period January 31 - March 15, 2020 compared to Italy.
This shows in particular that as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported the total number of cases comparable to Italy's cases in just 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite variations in national public health responses at different stages in countries, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients who need to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including holding tests.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data for hospitalization of COVID-19 cases and/or intensive care unit are currently only available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to supplement the current monitoring data which focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study, conducted in 2010-11, showed a significant difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe from 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with 90% risk of intensive care bed capacity is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Intensive Risk Assessment on COVID-19 with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK.
Since so far cases remain in flocks in EU/EEA countries and certain regions of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve the defined regional public, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a surge in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring continuous community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and health care, particularly intensive care, in the affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC’s Rapid Risk Assessment, with the changing approach to mitigation from limiting, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, because if not implemented in a timely manner, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may cause decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and not provide enough time to adapt to their response accordingly.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have little opportunity to further increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is highly likely that health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a rapid surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a disaster for humans.
Similar to its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which led to SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have also been transmitted from bats and produced similar symptoms by baggage mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects older men and women more than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a topical and comprehensive review of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, for-science, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While there are still a lot of questions to be answered, we hope this review will help in understanding and eradicating the deadly disease.
Due to the outbreak of novel viral disease, the Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who have been requested to stay at home throughout the holiday and for several weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) which led to the outbreak of ultra-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was named COVID Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to the entire country and around 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients dying due to the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "enemy number 1 of the public" and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, forensics, diagnosis, and treatment, isolation from many patients to determine the sequence of the virus.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress on new and rapidly evolving subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far with regard to the prevention and forecasting of the disease as well as some of the remaining yet urgent questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, with predominantly producing around 15% of common colds.
However, in this century we have encountered twice the highly pathogenic human CoVs, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible malnutrition and mortality.
Thus, current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1,1, the herd of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, was first reported from Wuhan to the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the order of CoV was issued.
The first fatal case from Wuhan was reported on 15 January 2020.
During this time, the pandemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported in health care providers, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all of its public transport being shut down.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was believed to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation continues to grow rapidly, the final prevalence and intensity of the outbreak are yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centric study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly between the ages of 30 and 65.
About half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very little under 20 and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spreads mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose sharply before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to widespread traffic before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of single-stranded large and infected viruses of RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The cover nozzle (S) connects to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidease 4 (DPP4) in glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then merges the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cellular fluid; after the replication of the viral genome, the casing forms vesicles containing genomic RNA virion with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then merge into the plasma membrane for the release of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of beta-CoV, with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequenced samples collected from Wuhan's Hunan seafood market, where the outbreak originated.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Transmission by electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-fine segments of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with more weakness than SARS-CoV which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces less severe infections than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make novel short proteins coded by orf3b and secreted proteins coded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in viral pathogenesis and block the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however orf8 does not have any known functional domains or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in a mixture with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which had free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could combine two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and Intermediate Nutrients
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from bats and were transmitted in humans by civet cats and camels respectively.
By comparing race to other CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, bats were considered the basic nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient has helped infect humans by crossing the virus species barrier is unknown and the transmission pathway is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as the carrier of the virus from bats to humans that involved a similar recombination with S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that pangolin - a long-mouthed, ant-eating mammals found in SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin - have a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity.
However, the spread of a difference of 1% across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in artificial ambient dry environments and up to 5 days at less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays for 30 minutes at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
In general, after the virus has penetrated into the host, it is first identified by the endogenous immune system of the host from C-type lectin-like receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces expression of inflammation factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophages phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to avoid immune responses.
Soon, the adapted immune response joins in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T auxiliary cells produce inflammation pro cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Tridosan immunity, including supplements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, immunosuppressives isolated from the recovered patient inhibited MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and even multi-organ failure and death in the worst conditions.
Older people with SARS-CoV-2 infections characterized by an onset in the herd are more likely to be affected and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a higher number of viruses or whose immune function is mixed are more likely to get infected than others.
Based on the first 425 case studies in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was on average 3 days and the range was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on a demographic of 8,866 cases found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing the virus of infected but symptomatic people from transmitting to other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to the virus or infected with it usually need 14 days of quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nausea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, rapid growth of the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidemia and coagulopathy in patients.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and pulmonary picture abnormalities should also be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of the herd generated by transmission from the family herd and the symptomatic person.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them needed ventilation support and this corresponds to MERS' more lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
SARS patients have seen that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and around 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 fatality rate was 2%, when the worldwide confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By comparison, the SARS death rate was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on a June 2012 demographic study.
The earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The swarm usually begins with a single family or a group of people or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected individuals or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can condense the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from the hospital can condense the virus again, which warns of an increase in quarantine time.
In the early stages, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphatic cells) in patients is normal or low.
For example, white blood cell counts including lymphatic cell counts 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, lymphopenia with 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and virulence were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood and most patients had increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood.
In patients with severe cases, a product of the fibrin collapse present in the blood, D-dimer levels, was increased and lymphatic cell counts continued to decline.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are characterized by bilateral stains in the lungs or ground glass ambiguity.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes reduces the level of side-effects and increases surface stress and thus reduces the ability of the lungs to flower and increases the risk of the lungs stopping working.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often remain parallel with the most serious condition of the disease.
The first diagnostic analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 looked at the vishalkan of the pneumocyte in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, the formation of haeline membranes and the porous leakage of lymphatic cells, and the multinuclear polycentric cells that corresponded to the pathology and ARDS of viral infections and were similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations in China began to be used for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (which was no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which is artificial at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (refer 10-100 copies per microliter of the input) using dipstick.
If verified in clinical samples, there is hope that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, physicians can provide predominantly supportive care to COVID-19 patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases previously used or proposed to try different therapies (Table (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunotherapy, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are engaged in developing antiviral and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 initially primarily invades the lungs and possibly even other organs in low range, which expresses ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Still, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain a major threat to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory aid is important for relieving symptoms and saving lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation, and penetrative mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified heart-pulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of life-threatening cardiovascular or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections, and protection of septic shock, and function of vital organs is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms occur as a result of an excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1 are a type of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IF<0xCE><0xB2>, IF<0xCE><0xB3>, and MN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MN<0xCE><0xB3>.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the major causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunotherapy is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, IL6-anti-monoclonal antibodies, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storms.
Other immune suppressive treatments for cytokine storm include T cell-directed changes in the immune response; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF blockage; JAK blockage; Blinatumab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC blockers.
Steroids as immune suppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects while dramatically affecting the diagnosis, especially non-vascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, short-term procedures of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given in the vein, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malberg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed a potential inhibition of other eccentric RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite promising.
Also, Baricitinib, Interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, Iopinavir/Ritonavir, and Ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Joint therapy with Iopinavir/Ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
Interaction with other drugs used in these treatments should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and immune production from recovered patients.
There has been a long history of aggregation of blood from patients recovering from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from suffering from the disease.
In fact, the recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies relative to the pathogen in the blood.
Immunoglobulins produced by B lymphatic cells to fight pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulins (IGs) and they identify unique molecules in pathogens and inactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and were intercepted in 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with less inflammation and viral load and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and explanation are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentrations of antibodies in the blood are generally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies so rapidly to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and recognize the genetic code that codes effective antibodies or check for effective antibodies to the virus's essential proteins.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effects depend primarily on the combination of different components in a different formula depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the TCM principles.
Most effective components are still unknown or meaningless because it is difficult to remove and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the leading alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe phases due to lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Doo capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
Among 87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), many provinces in China saw the highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19, while the Hubei province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the recovery rate was minimal (13%).
However, this is a fairly thick comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western medicine (WM) treatments and combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for the WM<0x2B>TCM group to normalize body temperature, go for symptoms, and hospitalization was significantly less than that of the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the symptomatic worsening rate (lightest to severe) of the WM<0x2B>TCM group was significantly lower than that of the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group (8.8% versus 39%).
Still, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaited in larger scale and more centres for more controlled trials.
It will also be interesting to identify the system of actions and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience much greater fear of highly contagious and deadly disease and quarantined people also experience dullness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, low-oxygenation and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more discomfort and mental agony.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological disorders were reported, including constant stress, restlessness, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide.
Finding mandatory contacts and quarantines as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more anxious and glamorous about the effects of stigma on contagion, quarantine, and their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have come in contact with them as well as the general public.
Psychiatric support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal cells and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often complementary to antiviral treatments under the control of the pandemic due to the growing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful inactivating immune and/or defensive immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live-animated vaccines have been evaluated in the bio-animal paradigms of SARS.
However, the vivo efficacy of these candidate vaccines in older people and lethally challenging models and their protection against zoonotic virus infections are still to be determined before the start of any clinical studies.
This is probably because SARS ended 17 years ago slowly and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the regions of the epidemic.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using sub-units of passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-resistant people is essential and important for controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty due to the long-term need for vaccine development (on average 18 months) and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without the symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to create a disease-diagnosed model to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on so far informed clinical studies, the following factors may affect or relate to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred predominantly in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of the patients were over the age of 50, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying ailments and complications and were significantly older than those who did not have such a need (at the median age of 51 versus 66), indicating age as a predictor of the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Surrogacy and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to ACE2-positive collagenocytes that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and the underlying disease have deep correlations and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate inflammation severity or tissue damage and have been proposed as a potential predictor of the disease, response to therapy, and finally recovery.
The correlation between the severity of COVID-19 and the diagnosis of the disease has also been proposed.
At the same time, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Key clinical symptoms: Should be considered for prediction of the consequences and complications of COVID-19 of chest radiography and topical progression of clinical symptoms along with other problems.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunocompromised commonly used as conjunctivitis therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered non-vascular osteoarthritis with lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in low doses and short-term COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured the long-term and extreme uncertainty of quarantine and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Providing psychological advice and long-term support is essential to help these people get out of stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and produce mild or no symptoms in the early stages of the infection, like other coVs that cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of the virus during daily activities in the early stage or in the incubation period, with a lot of difficulty in controlling the pandemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were very ill, while most transmissions did not occur during the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
With the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently underway in China, including a lockdown in Wuhan and nearby cities and a continuous quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates a downturn in the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the ups and downs phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both the mid-turbinate and throat phage of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the identified new virus could become a recurring case, like influenza.
However, there have been promising signals from China based on the declining number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
It was initially predicted to be one million cases with half a million deaths from Ebola.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens into infectiousness and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with contaminants from the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing other diseases and 40 health care providers, were likely caused by hospital infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect people or infected people who are in contact with humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series <0x23> 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected person from going into the air or sticking to the surface of things, from where they can go to others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23> 1860s) masks can prevent as few as 10 to 80 nm of virion from entering the air; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also cross five surgical masks placed on top of one, healthcare providers with direct contact with patients must necessarily wear N95 (Series <0x23> 1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit to further reduce exposure to viruses.
The virus can also infect a person with the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and possibly limit contact with infected individuals.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus for the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, due to its extreme similarity with SARS-CoV it may have alerted China to the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control in Wuhan consoled citizens by telling them that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited fertility and has no problems preventing and limiting the disease.
The message made the public free of fear, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the delicate time to limit the disease to the minimum level in Wuhan was over.
Disease control agencies in China can learn from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be very careful when making (1) public announcements because every word counts for the citizens and can change their attitude and decision; (2) should be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from physicians or authorities; (3) should be more restrictive to limiting the potential epidemic at the initial stage of the investigation and the system of public awareness rather than trying to console the public; and (4) the public awareness of the pandemic in general.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread to the whole of China and about 50 other countries around the world by the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has made SARS a frequent occurrence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than young people, and the severity and mortality rates in the elderly are also higher than in young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomatic, while SARS patients often do so when they are critically ill, which creates much more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be again positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several serious cases are yet to be resolved, which are:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-like coVs was found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species in the transmission of viruses from bats to humans?
Without finding an answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't effectively stop broadcasting and the outbreak can ever recur.
Although molecular imaging and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and then undergo pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-sponsored cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end up slowly like SARS, or will it continue to happen periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever price has to be paid, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic at the earliest and bring our lives back to normalcy.
Animal origin of human coronaviruses.
Mutations and adaptations have led to the simultaneous development of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) over a period of thousands of years.
Before 2003, there were two human coVs (HCOVs) known to cause mild illnesses such as a cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back to the light and shocked us with more infectious capacity but reduced pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and it will be useful to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
There is also information about the intermediate kosher nutrients of some HCoVs.
The prevention of human diseases has direct implications for the identification of animal nutrients.
Investigating the interactions of CoV-nutrients in animals can also lead to important insights on the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current information about the seven HCoVs with a focus on the history of the discovery as well as zoonotic origin and interracial transmission.
Importantly, we compare and see variations of different HCoVs from the point of view of the gradual development of viruses and gene recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need to successfully change the hosts and the severity of the disease have also highlighted the implications of the gradual development of the virus.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes groups of enveloped, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses sheltering the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses were named "CoVs" due to crown-equivalent morphology under electron microscopes.
Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome has two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins including spike (S), invalope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many genealogical-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different genealogies of CoVs.
Depending on the variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), most of which are HCoVs in the beta-CoV generation and are subdivided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
It has been observed in archaeological evidence that bats and rats are the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant arsenal of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently exceeded species barriers and have emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified SARS-CoV-2, are highly pathogenic while generating severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperpulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was distinguished by the nasal drift of patients with a cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gathered by detailed studies about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that the transmission of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003, infecting more than 8,000 people with an unreported death rate of about 10%, is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak generated a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have animal origins from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Many evidence supports the gradual development of all HCoVs from bats, in which the viruses are well-adapted and non-pathogenic, but show extreme genetic variations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detecting the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history of species crossing, motivational power and bonding factors.
It can guide or facilitate the discovery of cells, intermediates and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, with significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural habitats, but become pathogenic after the endogenous transmission to the new host.
We will also review the gradual developmental trend of HCoV in which an increase in infectiousness is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenesis.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E breed, which was first isolated from nasal drift of infected patients with common cold, different CoVs were isolated from many infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decades.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of the discovery of HCoV (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first breed of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in the year 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cellular lines of the WI-38 lungs.
In 10-20% of patients infected with HCoV-229E, symptoms of fever and cough, including headache, sneezing, unwellness and sore throat were observed.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the sequential pathway in the milking rat’s brain and from organ enrichment.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infections appear to be similar to the infections generated by HCoV-229E that are figuratively indistinguishable from infections with other respiratory pathogens such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and are likely to be prominently transmitted during the winter with temperate weather.
Usually, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2-week illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, mild colds developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Infection of the lower respiratory tract is seen in only a few patients with immunity disabled.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," was the first pandemic caused by well-documented HCoV in human history and the third factor, discovered is the SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS could be identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
With the spread of the SARS epidemic across several countries and continents, there were 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths.
In addition to those with the highest prevalence, it was estimated that with a gradual growth period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral bearing appearing on the 10th day of the disease, almost two secondary cases could increase due to each case.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle aches, headaches, fever, unwellness and chills, followed by shortness of breath, coughing and respiratory distress as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopenia, neurotic liver function tests and increased creatinine cyanase are laboratory-related abnormalities.
Transmitted airborne damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation later.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, usually with cytokine storms, can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be especially fatal for patients with immunity disabilities.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of the indicator patient who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, much effort has been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found to be spread among young children, the elderly and inimical patients with respiratory diseases.
Diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 are common in the appearance of colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis.
In another independent study, the same virus was described as isolated from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its extreme occurrence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the inhibitory larynx, also known as Krupp.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from the 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis found in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be related to severe asthma outbreaks.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found all over the world causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these HCoVs from the community have been well adapted in humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, as in the rare case of a more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, developing acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Where most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary prevalence among close relatives have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, match SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute kidney failure, which has been observed only in MERS so far in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end, swarms of pneumonia patients fully related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of a lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency of concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As on March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with an unrecovered case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are visible in the form of fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly increase as acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they come in different branches of the ethnographic lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible.
Asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other six HCoVs and seeing asymmetry has seen very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the erection period of the HCoV disease and the duration of the procedure are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is similar to SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show characteristics that are commonly observed during the transition of HCoVs acquired from the community, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also sees features of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectivity of HCoVs acquired from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases as cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV progress in humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether rectum-oriented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 can behave seasonally like cases of acquired HCoVs from the community.
Yet, features of SARS-CoV-2, including infectiousness, pathogenesis, and persistent spread, will be effective on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four HCoVs, acquired from the community that produces mild symptoms, have been well adapted in humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and those that develop serious HCoV diseases in humans have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the accumulation of adapted mutations that prevent nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remains and the more people infect, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent from quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitting to the human population, causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not require animal tissue.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to remain and spread in their zoonotic corpus and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing hosts.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least at the present time it is very contagious like HCoVs acquired from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and transmitted to humans without any arsenic or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be of great help to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the gradual development of HCoVs, natural, corpus, intermediate and amplifying nutrients.
An animal is a nutrient with a gradual development of HCoV, if it shelters a very close ancestor with high similarity sharing at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this nutrient.
In the same way, the intestines shelter the HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both conditions, the vultures become naturally infected and are natural nutrients of the HCoV or its ancestral virus.
In contrast, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around it enters humans, it is not well adapted to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an enhancer by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and then transmit it to humans to increase the level of infection.
If an HCoV cannot keep its transmission within the intermediate host, it can go into an end-infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate nutrient and maintain locality for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural nutrient.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that the SARS indicator case had a history of contact with game animals.
Later seroprevalence tests indicated that there was a greater prevalence of SARS-CoV in animal traders than in the general public.
In the live animal markets, masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the sewage in the markets was killed.
However, it has been reported that most of the masked palm civets in the wild or farms that did not come into contact with the live animal markets had SARS-CoV negative, which suggests that masked pal civets can only be severe as a middle-enhancing nutrient and not as a natural cushion of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou's markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, there is no denying the possibility that many species of small mammals may also be intermediate-enhancing hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these seem to be the last nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV called SARS-related rhinolophus bat HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese Horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive to the SARS-CoV-antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the nutrients of emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but no one other than WIV1 has been isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from specimens of stool of bats were exhibited to use bats, civets and human ACE2 as recipients for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients recovering was able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and that bats are not the closest cell host to SARS-CoV.
Archaeological analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bats use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for entering CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses.
The RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are closer to the bat beta-CoV counterparts identified genetically in Europe and Africa.
So far, no surviving MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the nearest cohort nutrient to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have seen that slumbered camels, like camels of Middle East origin, are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivating antibodies.
The living MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal cavities of the slumped camels, indicating that the camels are the authentic cavity nutrients of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth mentioning that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV generally had mild symptoms but had a lot of virus extraction.
Notably, infected camels extract viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the faecal-faced pathway, which is also the main route for the extraction of the virus from bats.
However, questions are still present as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or any unknown transmission pathways that involve a species of animals sheltering MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity from rats separated from CoV RaTG13 bats belonging to rhinolophus species.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine the ancestral relationship.
That is, bats can't be the nearest cohort of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical bats are found in the future.
Possibly, the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 must be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of Hunan seafood to which several early cases of COVID-19 were linked.
A number of recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolin (Manis javanika) may also shelter ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are in two sub-descendants of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the chromosome lineage, one of which shares a more uniform receptive binding area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse, despite gene-wide more sequencing similarities.
An earlier study of sick pangolin also reported finding a group of viral DNA overlapping from lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a number of different amalgamated methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence containing a full-length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
At the same time, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than that of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway for the gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Where RBDs have found the most sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the most genome-wide sequence similarities.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the extreme similarity between Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergence successive development.
An alternative proposal is in favor of a recombination between Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force of successive development, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The nearest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Archaeological evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rats.
It has been reported that the bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachen Ridge CoV) found in North American three-color bats was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although the Camelids are also its suspected intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current information on the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of inter-caste transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection epidemic was observed.
The history of interracial transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
The alpha-CoVs have been found to be very close to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpha-CoV.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
Previously, humans and not Alpacas had contact with bats in common ecological habitats.
Instead, humans are closely related to the alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Ultimately, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, there is no denying the possibility that alpaca get HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bats are the gene pools of alpha-CoVs HCoV-229E, alpacas and cucumber camels can be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interracial transmission from bats to slumbered camels and slumbered camels to humans.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known on its primary identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for inter - species exchange and inter - species transmission of genetic fractions.
Longevity, dense settlements, close social interaction and high flying ability are favorable conditions for all bats to be the ideal "virus broadcaster."
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been entering slump camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted in these camels that have been transformed from intermediate nutrient to stable and natural follicle nutrient.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has a sporadic transmission accident in humans and humans remain the ultimate host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolin in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolin.
They can be the ultimate host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs like Civet in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or refuted in future studies.
First, bats may be the follicle nutrients of the SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitats with bats by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolin may be one of the intermediate-enhancing hosts in which the new-born SARS-CoV-2-related virus entered.
Humans are infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of antibodies in domestic and wild animals are needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in the third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
In addition to different types of animal feeders, the three key factors in relation to viral are also important in smoothly crossing the species barriers of CoV.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-layer RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitution per place 2 per year, depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in new hosts.
CoVs contain proof-reading exoribonuclease, which can also lead to excessive variability and degradation or a decrease in life expectancy.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir, is believed to be the suppressor of the replication of CoV by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
Still, the mutation rate of CoVs is a million times higher than their nutrients.
At the same time, mutation rates are often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, pointing to a higher level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another nutrient close to humans.
As with SARS-CoV-2, it is also applicable to MERS-CoV that has been well adapted to slumbered camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the genetic flow will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome in CoV puts additional plasticity on the genome change for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of inter-ethnic co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by abundant unique open reading frames and coded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs randomly change repetitive patterns during RNA replication by a unique "copy-choice" procedure.
In the nutrient that acts as a mixing character, fibrous changes often occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Extremely similar full-length and subgenomic RNA can recombine and generate new CoVs.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Interaction of the virus-nutrient with respect to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient receptor is another important factor affecting interracial transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interracial transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of decompressors between humans and Civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is believed to be rapidly adapting to various nutrients with mutations on the RBD of the S protein in particular.
Usually, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is chosen by the nutrient immune response with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that connects with human ACE2 as well as its co-customers for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 clients of various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoon dogs, leading to interspecies transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be isolated from human and sewage viral isolations in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding radius for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of Civet SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be crucial in adapting to the viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the bond similarity of its S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, the cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attractiveness of this pair than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other co- recipient will be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Many other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silicic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal feeds.
The result of interracial transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to the cellular receptor.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and HCoVs' natural follicle nutrients, such as bats, slumbered camels, and rodents, can hinder interracial transmission.
The successful interracial transmission of HCoVs has to grip the nutrient dependence factors and reverse the nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-nutrient interaction are yet to be identified and described.
Non-partisan genome-wide testing of the nutrient dependence and containment factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest technology of CRISPR can be fruitful.
The emergence of novel HCoVs: return to the original base
The variety of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as the gene arsenal of CoVs, HCoVs.
At the same time, HCoV also develops due to rapid mutation and genetic recombination and serves two important stages in the process.
For example, the novel protein-coding gene has the potential to change viral symmetry of acquisition or loss a lot.
Among the SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since the SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to code different ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs has been characterized in breeds isolated at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the transformation of cells.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs genealogies, which identified a much larger number of small recombinant regions in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different genealogies, which occurred in swamped camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can cause unintentional changes in the viral genome, possibly due to selective stress-free viruses, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of the full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide extinctions.
While the intact ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, leading to a frameshift.
Finally but not less important, the gradual development of novel HCoVs also comes from the pressure of the election in their cohorts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats have adapted well to CoVs structurally and physically.
Defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats, for example, effectively reduce the pathogenesis generated by CoVs.
Additionally, the regulation of the inhibiting natural malignant cell activity in bats and the dominant tissue conformity of the natural malignant cell receptor NKG2/CD94 is suppressed due to the low expression level of the complex Category I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by more metabolic activity of bats can suppress the replication of CoV and affect proof readings by exoribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when entering the new host.
More pathogenic CoV breeds can also develop by recombination, which can lead to new protein or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-psychotic in cosmetologists such as bats and camels or cause mild symptoms.
They react strongly without showing strong nutrient-resistant reactions.
The secret lies in why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to the immune response and hyperactivity of the cytokine storm, in which the greater the immune response, the greater the serious lung damage.
In contrast, in symptomatic carriers, the immune response has been isolated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of isolating an immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reactions are particularly acute in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflamesum activation in bats is defective.
From this argument, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflamesum with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general theme that led to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoV has seen 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While the markets have seen sewage and other animals shelter viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate hosts to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fractions in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remained, there was no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally created or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come under discussion due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of animal cells of HCoVs in animal origin and standard transmission.
Predominant evidence has seen that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the basic bats and transmission in humans is through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection arises due to contact between humans and civets in markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civet there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolin should be removed from the weight market to prevent zoonotic transmission due to the discovery of several genealogies of pangolin beta-CoVs quite close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how it is still to be clarified in future tests.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been entering slump camels for several decades.
These camels are an important means of transportation for the local people as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS as it was done in China’s wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
Comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eradicate these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs are roaming in wild animals.
In particular, bats with zoonotic ability are very diverse.
It is highly likely that these zoonotic coVs will develop and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coVs that are more infectious and/or deadly in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, we must abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China.
With the rigorous testing of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and response plan should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural coils until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many features that help in the spread of viruses, if people are educated about how to stay away from bats, the possibility of human contact with them and other wild species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients which will be useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is to stay away from the ecological habitats of the natural cells of the zoonotic viruses of humans.
Many parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolin, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolin can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be clarified how it interacts with various species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infections must be performed.
Whether it is bats, pangolins, or any other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses, which are almost identical, will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous testing in this area will clarify the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant impacts in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Quick Consultation Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and this guideline provides an appropriate context for our experience and to fight the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has now been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has garnered a lot of attention since it was published.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China has issued a total of seven editions with fundamental changes in certain contexts in the guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
Now a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guidelines, they have introduced a simple marking proposition based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidelines and also provides valuable references to the pandemic around the world.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (March 3, 2020), any one item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations, or three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed if there is no clear epidemiological history to confirm the suspected case:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms began; (2) the history of contact with class 2 infectious cases such as SARS-CoV-2, confirmed cases of contact with the school (with positive nucleic acid test) etc.; (3) the history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas where the previous 14 days were reported.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of total white blood cells reflects normal, reduced or reduced lymphocytes in the early stages.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a single item of pathogenic or seriological evidence which is as follows: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is positive in the positive phase; (2) the velocity of the viral whole genome sequencing is shown to be high symmetry from the known novel coronaviruses; (3) the SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test and the specific IgM copy to SARS-CoV-2
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identities of the blood sample were added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then to the seventh edition, ceramic evidence was added.
These modifications were based on the ongoing work of the researchers, who discovered samples of an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for quick diagnosis, as well as the respiratory system, including blood samples, thereby increasing the availability of various samples, and supporting specific immune-positive results to be confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a number of evidence that reminds us to be careful with undiagnosed symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The score system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest to explore and follow the latest guidelines from their home countries.
Our team will also update its guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest single-day death toll so far
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest single-day death toll from the virus so far.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had reported 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported so far.
In an online news briefing, Dr Mirzadi Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said four men and one woman had died.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two patients were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11.
The deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission and was being treated at the Kuwait Friendship Hospital, a hospital official told Anadolu news agency.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Road Transport and Bridges Minister Ubaidul Qadar said that road transport will be closed for longer than planned until Saturday.
The ban on public transport began on March 26 and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential items such as medical items, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in the wife of two men and one of them who returned from Italy on March 8.
On March 19, all three were recovered.
More than 1 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded one million.
COVID-19 has been linked to at least 52,000 deaths due to the virus.
On the same day, Malawi reported its first coronavirus infection and Zambia reported its first death.
North Korea has claimed that as of Thursday, it was among the few countries that are still free from coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) of Central European time on April 4.
The United States has recorded more than 2,444,000 coronavirus cases, and at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted data from Johns Hopkins University as saying that more than 1,000 deaths have been reported in the US due to the coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced even more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted in favor of extending the national emergency by 15 days; the said resolution passed by 215 votes, ten members absent and one voted against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a 24-hour curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; earlier the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dawkins announced that the state's stay-at-home order has been extended until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time in all their stores nationally to two and one packages, respectively.
ALDI had also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted in the form of messages at checkout sites and on the Facebook pages of the series.
It is reported that the buyers were shopping aggregated for a situation where they need to keep themselves isolated due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the limit of buying toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in his March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban coming into force, "the stock is still depleting within an hour of delivery in many stores," and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unprecedented" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a "severe surge" in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra had also restricted the volume to two packs last week.
To further mitigate the shortfall, Coles placed orders for more large packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths placed additional stock orders, while ALDI raised stocks to make available early on a pre-planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers should try to increase stocks, but it is difficult to do so because of restrictions imposed by the local council at the time of truck delivery.
As suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials has already been reduced, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock was released ahead of time, some stores may not operate Wednesday specials.
Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reported in a report at News.com.au that stores fill stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavy item, so a large number of it cannot be stocked, and then, when the whole stock is sold, large shelves are left empty behind, making the deficiency more noticeable.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, "The idea of Coles and Woolworths is [that] if there were a lot of stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizer could [buy] and be present in large quantities, the confusion could possibly be reduced."
Hu Gives A Crap, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that his stock had run out.
Kimberly-Clark, a cleanx toilet tissue manufacturer, and Solaris Paper, a sorbent maker, said they were working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that in Melbourne, where fewer auctions are being conducted than ever before due to buyers celebrating the long weekend of Labor Day, some property sellers are giving free toilet paper to the first bidders at the auction.
A daily published in Darwin, the Thursday edition of NT News contained an eight-page insert that was cut and given to use as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, stores were initially not willing to impose a ban; in the report they said they had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry items, handwashes and dough.
Similarly, outside Australia, a 12-roll two-pack limit was also imposed on the purchase of Andres toilet paper at the online British supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a global pandemic.
While the term "global pandemic" only refers to how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
"All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic.
If the country detects the disease in response, treats patients, keeps them most isolated, tracks them and unites them," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity."
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented."
In comments published by CNN in February, he had said that “no respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected by a sustained global spread.”
Gabrielis also expressed a similar view when he said, “We have not seen a global pandemic from a coronavirus until now.”
"And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
This new title of the global pandemic is given in January after the WHO's mandate to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency.
“One thing about a hundred things, it’s going to get worse,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about the outbreak.
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths as a result, the Associated Press reported.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Its outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which was declared a public health emergency on 30 January 2020 at the international level and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have been cured.
The case fatality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can also be from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
First aid is symptomatic and assistive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has triggered severe global socio-economic chaos, prompted the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies caused by people panicking shopping.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationwide or locally, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against the Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and other people of color, and others from regions with more virus cases.
Low travel and heavy industry closures have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) reported mass cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-promoting virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was later found to be ill on 1 December 2019, and the person did not have a visible relationship with the group of subsequent beef market.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post reported that one case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019, which could be the first case. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that Italy, Iran and South Korea have experienced a sudden increase, with new cases falling in China, the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very little information of cases may have been recorded, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19 years of age and under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Wallace, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before an effective group can receive immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and according to official protocols whose tests have been positively confirmed.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies to not only test people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original fertility number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused nearly 97,000 deaths.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic refers, in general, to those who have been found positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be very high, as it may not include people who die without testing such as at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the additional death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted “We know [the alleged death toll] has been imposed,” a statement that is backed by descriptive information of low counts in the U.S. Such neutrons often occur in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed deaths occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy, each outside mainland China.
As of 13 March, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and regions on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time, and the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health are affected. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In China, the death-case ratio is estimated at 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020). Other measures include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease dying, and the non-infected mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease dying from a disease.
These statistics are not timed and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range corresponds to the results of a statistical study analyzing the effect of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final period of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
McKee's Bonnie from Penn State University said: "On leaving uncontrolled, infectious outbreaks generally stabilize and begin to decrease when there are no available nutrients for the disease.
But it's almost impossible to make any sensible guesses as to when that will be."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could end by June" if all countries follow WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 is "probably going to be circulating for a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will completely disappear, as it spreads very easily" and that "it can turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The severity of the return will depend on the group's range of immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cuff), decreased sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhoids, diarrhoea or nausea. According to WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden swelling, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical care is advised if these symptoms are present. The over-development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic trauma and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued advice that people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked so that the infection can be overcome.
Chinese estimates of the asymptotic ratio range from some to 44%.
The normal erection period (time between infection and the onset of symptoms) lasts from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, estimates of the fraction of people with COVID-19, who had lost their sense of smell, were initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly by small droplets generated during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that the drops can range from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that are produced while speaking, which remain in the air longer. Breathing drops may also occur while exhaling, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally ventilated.
The droplets can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through inhalation into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as duct insertion and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretion and thus airborne transmission.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it can be spread by stools, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of stool-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.
Tests for people's disease have been positive for up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of confirmed asymptomatic cases are present in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection tests.
According to the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to a day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as is done after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which decomposes its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus genetically belongs to the group of Gana betacoronavirus, the subgenus Serbecovirus (descendant B) with two bat-derived breeds.
This is 96% similar to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between viruses from pangolins and parts of genome sequences from humans to viruses.
In comparison to the entire genome so far, the general genetic content between the Pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient to standardize the intermediate nutrient to the pangolins.
The infection can be temporarily detected by the virus based on symptoms, although the reverse transcription of the infected secretion is ultimately confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its many image features are less specific as it is similar to other pneumoniaes and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to test or to diagnose COVID-19."
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
In general, this test is performed on nasopharyngeal fah, but a sore fah can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characteristic image characteristics on symptomatic people's radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral ground glass ambiguities and absent pleurisy secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Being similar to other infections such as adenovirus, there is limited specificity of imaging in identifying COVID-19, without confirmation by the PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and demonstrated that although imagery is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemiological areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of viruses with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent the transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and putting that tissue directly into the trash can.
People who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised all non-essential movements in countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a state of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they became infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, take contact precautions, and protect the eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data of mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log in close proximity to a user’s other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about methods of infection prevention are spreading; for example, it is not effective to rub the nose and rubbing with a mouthwash.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
In addition, the CDC recommends using at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine (within a minute of exposure to a disinfectant to a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons should be disinfected if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at an office or day care facility.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then immediately dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing a mask may limit the amount of inhaled drops that are spread over talking, sneezing and coughing, and the distance to be travelled.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.” Masks are also recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are taking care of a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of face masks by ordinary people.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-therapeutic face masks made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable therapeutic masks by ordinary healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering public places without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all people entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when going into the public sector.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks while going out, while making homemade face masks is also recommended for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control functions, which aim to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply ways to create social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greeting without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandated or recommending social distancing in the areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum population recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later up to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and degenerative immune system are at higher risk of serious diseases and complications, and they are advised by the CDC to keep physical contact as clear as possible, or to make use of the term "social distancing" starting at the end of March 2020.
The use of the term "social distancing" generated implications that, instead of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means, they should adopt complete social isolation. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations for having sex with only the person living with you, who does not have symptoms of the virus or virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have made self-quarantine mandatory or recommended for the entire population residing in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine directives have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of final possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are prevention or suppression, and mitigation.
Prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at detecting infected people as well as implementing other measures and vaccinations to control the infection so as to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to stop the spread of the disease, efforts go into mitigation stages: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
The combination of both prevention and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, to reverse the epidemic by reducing the original reproductive number by 1. Part of managing the outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the extreme extent of the epidemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services crumbling and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that can manage outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-quarantine; community measures intended to create physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass testing and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected people who self-quarantined and imposed a hefty fine on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and penalized hoarding of medical supplies. The simulations for Great Britain and the US show that there are major challenges in mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic but not stopping) and suppression (reverting the development of the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by 2/3rds and death by half, but these still lead to hundreds of deaths and health systems collapse.
Suppression can be preferred, but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is first), otherwise the transmission from the dysfunction in measures returns faster.
Long-term intervention for the suppression of the pandemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold-frying medications without a prescription, drinking liquids, and relaxing can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory aid may be required.
The results can be worse with the use of steroids.
Many compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Enhancing capacity and optimizing health care for the needs of COVID-19 patients, has been described as a fundamental outbreak response measure by the WHO.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing on laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by personnel training and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, in which living animals were also sold, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of zoonotic origin. The pneumonia group with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Zhang Jiaan, a doctor at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who was diagnosed on December 27.
On December 30, a group of Wuhan Central Hospital physicians alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Police warned eight doctors, including Lee Wenliang, for spreading false rumours and another doctor, Ai Feng, was rebuked by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the WHO.
A considerable number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in investigations initiated in early January. During the initial stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to Chinese New Year movement and Wuhan transportation center and major rail exchange.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official statistics show that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the US has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantine (home stay orders, shelter orders at your place, or lockdown) and curfew. As of April 2, about 300 million people in the US, or about 90% of the population is in some form of lockdown, over 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, about 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, there were 1.7 billion people worldwide in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - almost a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report shows that the first case occurred on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixian noticed a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
After these reports came, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a fierce campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was called the "People's War" by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Described as the "biggest quarantine in human history," a siege zone was declared on January 23 to stop movement in Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshenson Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Liechtenstein Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities such as conference centers and stadiums in Wuhan into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government set up additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country were also closed.
The areas of Hong Kong and Macau established a number of measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely were established in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was revised, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Control over the movement of people was imposed in several cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external restrictions. After the outbreak came to its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "incoming" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, only one case was transmitted domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this instance through a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of cases transmitted domestically has been basically stopped and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day two months after the lockdown was imposed except Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders will be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when the policy will expire.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa to Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning, starting at 10:00 am on April 4, with a three-minute national silence, which was on time for the Qingming celebrations, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online while observing physical distancing to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to the crowding in Daegu of a new religious movement known as Jesus' Shinchianji Church.
Shincheonji devotees coming from Wuhan to Daigu were suspicious of the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 or about 13% of the church’s 9,336 followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of warning on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined when tests confirmed that the three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline programmes were also affected and so they were changed. The programme that South Korea introduced was considered the largest and best organized programme in the world to check the population for the virus and isolate any infected people as well as to identify and quarantine those who have contacted them.
The methods of screening included mandatory self-information of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, accelerated testing for the virus with the results available the next day, and increased testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea’s program is considered a breakthrough in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantineing entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided on the response to President Moon Jae-in’s crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised her response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest single-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that from April 1, all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the coma on February 19, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included closing concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and closing universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities before the Persian New Year Navroz.
By 16 March 2020, Shia shrines in Qom were open to pilgrims. During February, Iran became the epicenter of the virus transmission after China.
Amid claims of concealing the amount of outbreaks in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases related to Iran by February 28, indicating that the amount of outbreaks could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government as of that day.
The Iranian parliament was closed when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch also urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally free detainees detained for peaceful protest and temporarily free all eligible prisoners.
It said closed institutions such as detention centres are at higher risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran reported 50 new cases every hour and a new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many cases as are being reported in Iran.
It has also been suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may have affected the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to postpone all flights from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was detected. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new judicial-law to prevent the outbreak, with more than 50,000 people quarantined from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas with prolapse, entry and exit will not be provided.
Work activities and sporting events in those areas have already been ordered to be postponed.” On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths were reported in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held without eyewitnesses by April, but on March 9, all games were postponed completely for at least a month.
On March 11, the Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all business activities, except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding the protocols of sorting, which could be employed, serious patients.

As of April 5, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and its inability to test people who had the virus at the time could have contributed to higher mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most relaxed of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in response to concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to stop all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting people to work from home where possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers up to the limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent distress unemployment. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced strict social distancing measures, including restrictions on gatherings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through fines imposed and mob disperse.
Most businesses were ordered to close except for those considered "essential" businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the U.S. government's premier public health institution - announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. began slow in testing, which made it difficult to understand the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
Defective test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and testing by restrictive criteria for people to be eligible for a test by the beginning of March (then a doctor's order was required).

On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency aid operations for developing countries.
The WHO has appreciated the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containment of the pandemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid fear before the Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Gallia remarked that while “certainly the WHO did not recommend the outbreak of the first time since 2009” it was “a very important sign of the commitment to preventing the epidemic in the post-pandemic period of the PHEC, which confirmed the number of other cases in the place where it is most concentrated” and called it “the unprecedented in the public health surge outside of China,” on 30 January.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the reason for PHEIC was "the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle-income countries without strong health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement."
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community to contribute $675 million to strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that do not have "systems set up to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was about to emerge."
Tedros announced in further statements, that “we are only as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more later.” On February 11, the WHO established the name of the disease of COVID-19 at a press conference.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of an entire UN system in response."
As a result, a crisis management team from the United Nations was activated, coordinating the entire UN response, which according to WHO would enable them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies could use their expertise to bear the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak."
On February 14, a joint mission team led by the WHO with China, to assist in domestic management and host workshops and meetings with major national-level institutions, said it should be prepared to have a "severe severity and contagiousness of the disease" in the pre-pandemic stage, but to make an effort to assess the "activeness and impact of the response activities at the provincial and county levels including the WHO" to provide the WHO to the region and to assess the "the impact of the WHO, international, regional and international
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO authorities said that the threat of coronavirus globally would be assessed from “high” to “very high”, which is the highest level of vigilance and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency program, warned in a statement that "this is a reality check for every government on earth: it's time to wake up."
This virus may be coming your way and you need to be prepared," insisting that correct response measures can help the world survive "at its worst."
Ryan further said that current statistics have not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially acknowledging that every human on earth will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO was "deeply concerned both by the alarming level of spread and severity and the alarming level of inaction". The WHO has faced major criticism as to the inadequate management of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
Signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, the retaliation included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed on respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minority groups, elderly people, internally displaced people, homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with perspectives and advice.
From policies to strengthening health systems and addressing the impacts of travel bans and restrictions on the world's economy, the digital hub includes a country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The US of the Chinese government, British minister for cabinet office Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have criticised the Chinese government's handling of the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were sacked to deal with quarantine efforts in central China, signaling dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected a pre-acceptance of the coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration has referred to the coronavirus as "the Chinese virus" or "the Wuhan virus," saying that China's "control system has now turned a virus into a global pandemic," which some critics have described as "distracting from racism and his administration's failure to prevent the disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government telegram that outlines communications moratoriums with clear origins in the National Security Council, citing as a strategy that "everything is about China."
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. “Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s attempt to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of the publicity to increase global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it has "a geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence and the "policy of generosity" through manipulation."
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, which have reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
The donation of Jack Ma's 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
The U.S. authorities have also been accused of converting the aid intended for other nations to their own country.
And masks-related disputes have emerged among other countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with the coronavirus-affected Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "only China responded bilaterally."
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, following a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged to send military physicians, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to the Russian army.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "unnecessarily or very little of Italy's use."
The source accused Russia of flattering "geopolitical and diplomatic."
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia sent medical aid material from a cargo plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "[Putin] believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials will increase production, they will also be able to pay back when necessary."
The largest NATO war exercises since the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the NATO "Defender 2020" military exercises will be held at a low level.
Secretary-General for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public-health crisis, it is not only endangering the lives of soldiers from the United States and many European countries, but also the residents of the countries participating in it.” The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, in which about two dozen parliamentarians are infected, as well as the current or fifteen others.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak as the U.S. sanctions against Iran have resulted in non-access to international markets. The outbreak has prompted the U.S. to adopt similar social policies in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high-level funding for public health.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
Japan's "unambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" were criticised by South Korea when Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at designated sites by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment, or praised her response, claiming the government’s mismanagement of the outbreak. The pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their hold on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, to rule indefinitely, suspend elections as well as parliament and punish those who were found to be dealing with the virus and the crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages that arose from the use of tools to fight the outbreak on a global scale, fear-induced shopping, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of drugs and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Many areas also witnessed a state of panic-induced shopping, which led to a shortage of essential groceries such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from the shelves, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about delays in transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase of up to twenty times in normal value as well as delay in supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that it would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity created a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the high demand for food products, both regions are spared an extreme shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade of important products have been successful, preventing the extreme shortage of food that was projected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major decline in its significant agricultural production, but prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were also seen only temporarily in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released Schuker-meat stores to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
The global economy in China has felt a loss: According to a media report on March 16, government measures to stop the spread of the virus, and a 20.5% drop in retail sales caused a deep injury to the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
Since mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the outbreak of the virus has been considered a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit has projected that markets will remain volatile until a clear picture emerges on possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could be greater than the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis reported an impact of $300<0x2B> billion on the world's supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "fighted" after oil prices fell sharply due to lower demand from China.
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
Due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak on February 27, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indexes fell more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign creditworthiness determination, but maintained a negative expectation.
Stocks fell again on the basis of coronavirus apprehensions, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people believe that there is a possibility of an economic slowdown.
Economist Mohamed Al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures of central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than the financial crisis of 2008.
Tourism is one of the worst-affected areas due to travel restrictions, closure of public places, including travel attractions, advice from governments to stop any travel around the world.
As a result, several airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quants, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline flybys collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was the highest ever seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The time of this pandemic also coincides with the time of Chunyu, the main travel session associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events, including annual New Year celebrations, were canceled by national and regional governments, with private companies freely closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed in Beijing to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended New Year's holiday until February 10, with most workplaces directed not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, with schools closing until March and cancelling their New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been hit globally, with store hours dwindling or temporarily shutting down.
Retailers tours in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
People who walked to shopping centers in March fell 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as an increase in sanitation, setting up thermal scanners to check temperatures of shoppers, and canceling ceremonies. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America who would not be in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded at home in inland provinces or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates the unemployment rate could fall to 32%. Several million migrant workers have become unemployed due to the lockdown in India (those who are paid through daily wages). Workers lost their jobs after 90,000 were laid off in mid-March 2020. A survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment in 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal loan scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to government-funded short-term working plans called Kurzarbet.
The German Short-Term Work Compensation Scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organizations globally as well as individuals working and working independently.
The arts and culture sector organizations strive to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and, where possible, maintain their (mostly publicly funded) mission to support artists.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions across the world were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, ceremonies and exhibitions cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing result of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, sporting major ceremonies, and other social gatherings, such as concerts and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that the observances of Holy Week in Rome, which take place during the last week of Lent’s Christian mourning season, have been cancelled.
Many bishop areas have recommended elderly Christians to stay at home instead of attending mass on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic bishop-region of Rome closing its churches and prayer halls and evacuating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples and gurudwaras and restricted public ceremonies.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed pilgrimages, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most significant disruption in the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season, and 2019–20 NHL season, have been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted the plan for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be rescheduled to a "date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments postponed or canceled.
Due to this many gamblers are adopting the online method, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concerts.
Many large theatres such as Broadway also suspended all exhibitions.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as creating live streaming of concerts or web-based "functions" to promote artists' performances, distributions, and their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as humor and distraction amidst uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increasing prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and people with hotspots in Europe, America and other countries have been noted.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have seen incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility.
In information since February (when most cases were still limited to China), racist feelings of Chinese people being able to receive viruses or receiving fair punishment have been documented across groups around the world.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people in virus-affected areas.
Following the progress of the outbreak in the new hotspot countries, Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to prevent the disease.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the US, have reported increased levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus," which was perceived by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign vacuumed people from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
Students from northeast India, bordering China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "so God has avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling it "misleading". In China, xenophobia and racism toward non-Chinese residents were fuelled by the pandemic, describing foreigners as targets for "foreign waste" and "removal".
Several newspapers with paywalls removed him for part or the whole of his coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of the virus and detecting antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunotherapy can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Immunotherapy tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or who were symptomatic.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass immunity in people.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among people as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had verified more than 3% of its population and there are considerable inequalities in how much has been verified in different countries.
This inequality is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is expected to be significantly higher in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal phages or mucus samples, can be examined.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test done with sore throat is reliable in the first week of the disease itself.
The virus can later disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second week, alternatively, the sample material can then be taken from the airway through the suction catheter or used in coughing.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in Charité in Berlin in January 2020, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed the testing kit until 23 January 2020. South Korean company Koganbiotech developed a diagnostic category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It explores the "E" genes shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp genes specifically found in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is the first company in the United States to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Prevention and Control Center (PCR-based SARS-CoV-2) of China's National Institute of Health, CoronaCoV-2019.
Older versions of the test kits yielded inconclusive results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests, and caused problems in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples a day of successfully processed samples throughout February 2020.
The tests using the two components were not considered reliable till 28 February 2020 and till then the state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate the tests.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. The US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, Labcorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available across the country till 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; the aggregation and processing of samples should be done in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11th February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12th March 2020, the Mayo Clinics were reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13th March 2020, Rosh Diagnostics was granted permission from the FDA for high-dose testing that can be done within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests to be done from one machine in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hollogic, Labcorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Shefed received an EUA for an investigation from the FDA that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved an investigation that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can yield positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing for 50,000 tests per day. A testing kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, with the hope that this acute influenza can result in 15 minutes of testing.
A literature review of March 2020 concluded that “the chest radiography at the early stage has little clinical significance, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical characteristics of CT include bimetallic multilobar ground-glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effect of subplots, crazy paving and consolidation develops.
A study comparing the CT of PCR to the source point of the current pandemic, in Wuhan, has suggested that it is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific, with many depicting features of CT being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a test or first line check for the diagnosis of COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine immunity in individuals starting in and around 7 days after the onset of symptoms and to detect infections for people to monitor. Tests can be done at Central Laboratories (CLT) or through Point-of-care Testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to see a resistant reaction.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
The first evacuation step of the test, unlike PCR methods, is not required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when needed and are thus now able to distribute their immunity checks.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority. At the end of March 2020, EuroImmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe’s approval for their testing kits that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Immunologists can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the immune testing kits they purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong devised a plan in which suspected patients can stay at home, “the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube”, they will return spitting in it and get the results of the test in a short time. The British NHS announced that they are planning to conduct a home screening of suspicious cases, which eliminates the risk of infecting others with COVID-19 in the care of the patient’s caregivers, if he goes to the hospital or disinfects the suspected ambulance.
Drive-through testing centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests from any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the ability to conduct around 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory setting and conducted 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the order of check is given by the doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's total capacity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-through checks have been offered in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey found that up to week 12/2020, including week 12/2020, a total of 483,295 samples were tested and tested in the first week of February of 2020, 64,491 (6.9%) samples were tested in the laboratory, which was positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, the researchers at Technion and Rambo Hospital found that the samples were further combined and if the combined samples were tested.
With the supervision of construction by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model has observed that if this testing capacity had not been initiated, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory's Huo-Yen labs are immediately followed by Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiple open-source outlines have been released by Origami Assess which can check up to 1122 samples of as many as COVID19 patients using 93 tests. These balanced outlines can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
Before March, shortcomings and inadequate amounts of reagents became a problem in large-scale testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
This prompted some authors to explore the protocols of sample preparation that included heating the samples at 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing at the per capita rate of increasing the level of its population to a greater level of coronavirus than any other country.
This was due to a combination of drive-through testing capability and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to perform thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside of China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany's method to develop kits for low-income countries to develop themselves.
Germany’s method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control of the United States was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak there were problems between China and the United States on the reliability of the test kits and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed by the South Korean government during several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that extending testing programmes is the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to a pile of thousands of outstanding tests in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of fahs and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its testing kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were “reduced”; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private checks. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeg Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm reported that the wrong results could be due to the failure to collect the samples or to use the kits correctly.
Spain’s ministry said it would remove the wrong test kits and replace them with the second test kit provided by Shenzhen BioEG. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic gave wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they should be put in the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they "did not use them." The UK, which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
The people who tested positive after the test were quarantined and those who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be positive.
Replacing the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in Italy's V<0xC3><0xB2> town tested twice on the entire population of about 3,400 people at a gap of about ten days.
Nearly half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and those with all the detected cases were quarantined.
New infections have been completely eliminated from the travel ban.
By aggressively detecting contact, internal travel restrictions, by checking and quarantined, but without forcing extreme restrictions such as the closure of restaurants and retail establishments, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic is much slower than in other developed countries in Singapore.
Many programs have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but reopened on time on March 23 after school holidays.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also aggressively managed the pandemic by detecting contact, by imposing internal travel restrictions, by checking and quarantined, but by less aggressive lockdowns.
The statistical study found that countries with higher tests than the number of deaths have a much lower case fatality rate, probably because these countries are more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and have limited experience in national laboratories send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of positive in checks" is influenced by the country's check policy.
Similar to other things, in a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands for the purpose of removing soil, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands regularly with soap at "essential moments" during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five important moments during the day where it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s buttocks or changing lanyards, before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or before and after consuming raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby using the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal feed, animal feed, or animal waste.
Therapeutic hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to therapeutic procedures.
Washing hands before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean by hand the pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or diseases.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the therapeutic field, but it is also an important action for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in cases of childbirth at home.
A 2013 study showed that well-washing exercises in children under the age of five may improve their length slightly.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash your hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases.
This simple task can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in cases of diarrhea may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and severe respiratory infections (ARI) in the form of auto-induced behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five, with an estimated 1.8 million children dying each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill about 35 lakh children annually.
According to UNICEF, making hand-washing a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or therapeutic measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by about half and the number of deaths from acute respiratory infection by one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation and sanitation (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as a symptom of psychosis-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission from the faecal-faced pathway of the disease: after using the toilet (urine immersion, faecal-exhalation), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (after changing the chopsticks), before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or in raw meat, fish, or poultry consumption.
Other occasions when the proper technique of hand washing should be practiced to prevent the transmission of the disease are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households adopted the practice of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that in Saudi Arabia there was the highest rate of sampling by 97 percent; in the U.S. with 77 percent the rate of washing was moderate; and in China with 23 percent the rate of washing hands are the lowest. At critical times many of handwashing procedures are available to enhance the behavior.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of mass action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national programme includes daily tooth cleaning from fluoride as well as daily hand washing with soap, taking anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It can be better to remove microorganisms from the skin by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the barriers in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
The water will help in the healing process.
Because of repeated use, solid soaps can contain bacteria left over from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to the bacteria being washed with foam.
Yet, according to the CDC, "measured soaps with a liquid soap dropping facility on the palms without touching hands are better."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted with emphasis for the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are propagated to be effective.
In addition to moisturizing and skin-protecting agents, sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, microorganismally active benzoic acids and other skin adapters (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) to prevent saponification.
Comfortable hot water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very fast at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove soil and bacterial-containing natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a hand sanitizer with a water-free base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, wet-weary alcohol-free hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began gaining popularity.
Most of these are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated with glycerin in a gel such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid), or a moisturizer such as a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
The combination of tanu hydrogen-peroxide increases antimicrobial activation even more. Hand sanitizers containing 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers destroy bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol destroy 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of applying (similar to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria after 1 minute of applying (4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and are less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) types of viruses that are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal sores. Adequate hand disinfectants or alcohol rubs should be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
The front and back portions of both hands and in the middle and the pores of all the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Fingernails should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick disinfection activation towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by mixing glycerin and/or other lubricants into the formula.
In clinical trials, lubricant-containing alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial inhibitors.
Contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to the additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs.
The low tendency to induce irritating contact dermatitis compared to hand washing with soap and water became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, unwatered agents do not clean organic substances by hand, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol rubbishes.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce effectiveness after repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions, has been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activation after applying formulations using benzalconium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities can’t buy soap and use ash or clay instead.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Similar to soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO has recommended ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because basins with stable water can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Make foam by rubbing the appropriate amount of soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are removed by rubbing for a longer time.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can contaminate again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands become more easily re-contaminated. The areas most missed are the area between the thumb, wrist, fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chippy nail polish can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, different low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing, for example, by pouring water from a hanging pot with suitable pores and/or using ash. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas) other water-saving options are available, such as "lower-conservation" solutions.
Tippi-tap is a simple technique in which a leg-powered lever, used to pour a small amount of water on the jaggery, and hands, and soap sticks, hanging by the rope.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Large amounts of research suggests that paper towels provide more hygiene than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on average on finger mattresses and 254% on palms.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on finger mattresses and 15% on palms.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in the ability to cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which extracts air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microbes from the hands and unit and possibly pollute other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared with drying with paper towels.
Washing hands using hand sanitizer wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water during the trip.
The alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Therapeutic hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in the prevention of disease in the hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when forgotten.
One study found that their use has reduced the infection rate.
Therapeuticly the hands are washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, in which the foam is made using the appropriate amount of soap and water or gel and each part of the hands is rubbed.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed with each other.
If there are trash under the nails, a tight-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry by wiping with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit door should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the hand from being contaminated again with those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“ germs”) and prevent them from being transmitted.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most therapeutic environments, with a large number of physicians and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing in health care sectors.
The manual manual of hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was made by Vitby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if performance of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has set “five opportunities” for hand washing:
After coming into contact with blood/body fluid
Before the work of disinfection, and
After patient care. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap) gives the hand washing agent the kill ability.
Before undergoing surgery or in an arrangement in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly extensive, such a firepower may be desired. For surgical rip-offs to ‘rub your hands’, to be a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching hands, to be a must-have for cleaning the nails, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, to clean the hands after washing, a disinfected towels.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and wrists to the elbows for 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the completion of hand washing, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of a sick person or use hand disinfectant.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning was increased by more than 35%, very little additional benefit was obtained.
By washing hands with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease is more than three times than washing with antibacterial soap. Compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap from alcohol-based solution, hand washing with antibacterial soap is done for a median time of 30 minutes. Compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap, it was found that the sanitizer in the hand rubs bacteria from alcohol up to 26 percent.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium diphenyl spores by hand. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care systems include increasing the availability of hand wash to employees, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and may include written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an affordable, necessary means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools, and workplaces poses a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, most rural Africa has very few hand-washing faucets near every private or public toilet, even though cheap options exist to build a hand-washing station.
However, lower hand washing rates may also be due to ingested habits rather than being caused by a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and support of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social campaigns are less effective. An example for the promotion of hand washing in schools is the “three-star method” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap along with other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars, respectively.
Making hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotional campaigns that are done to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign aimed at trying to bring about a change in behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to prevention of DALYs.
However, one review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and hygiene measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or in wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified by two promoters of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the British who are the "founders of modern nursing."
Most people at the time believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called myasmus.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as a key way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of the swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness of the importance of washing hands with soap in many countries to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct techniques of hand washing" were hung near the hand washing sink in public toilets and toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "wash your hands" from something, means to declare your reluctance to take responsibility for that thing or to assume a collusion in it.
It stems from the biblical Matthew chapter where Pontius Pilate separated himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to clean up a fictional stain that reflects her guilty conscience about the crimes she committed and the motives her husband committed to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or contemplating immoral actions, and attach greater importance to hand washing tools.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other “cleaning” tasks such as volunteering.
Religions recommend washing hands for both sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soapy water without washing hands is a part of the ritual hand washing described in many religions including Bahá'í religion, Hinduism, Tevilla and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Vazu in Islam. Religions also advise washing hands especially after certain tasks to provide hygiene.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the Risks of COVID-19 Infection Spreading in the Workplace
To control the risks of the spread of COVID-19 infection in the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there are applications of occupational safety and health practices to control the risks.
Proper control of the risk of the spread of the disease in the workplace depends on the workplace and the work to be done, based on the risk assessment of contact sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low contact risk actions have minimal business contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: hand washing, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate contact risk actions are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not aware or suspected of having a COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, measures to control the dangers for this group include: ventilation from high-efficiency air filters, using snazz guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for the situation if a COVID-19 infected person is facing.
The OSHA considers those health workers and mortuary personnel at high exposure risk, who come in contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases to a high exposure risk if the personnel perform, or collect or handle, aerosol-producing procedures on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person.
The hazard controls suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have many effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work for fear of being sick, needing to take care of others, or potential contact.
What goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as less demanding times or purchases through delivery or moving services), may change the nature of the business in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of objects from critically affected geographical areas may be affected by COVID-19. Preparation and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and job functions, including risk factors arising from risk sources, home and community arrangements, and risk factors of individual personnel such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address the risks and contingency plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Targets for response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease affects the reactions to be adopted in the community where the business is located.
The sequence of threats controls is a structure that is widely used to form a group of threats controls according to the effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and this may be the most economical solution in implementing it.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
All types of PPE to be selected, fitted appropriately (e.g., respirators), constantly and properly worn, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low contact risk tasks have minimal business contact with people and other colleagues.
Recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include: frequent and well-washing of hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquette covering cough and sneeze, providing tissue and waste materials, and making regular cleanings, if necessary, with the use of remote or intermittent cleaning tools, preparing personnel with the tools of others.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals in the workplace is an important step for the safety of personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute cardiovascular disease stay at home until they are at least 24 hours without fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms without the use of a fever-reducing or other symptom-transforming medication, and that the policies of the sick leave allow employees to stay flexible, and that the staff stay at home to take care of a sick family member.
According to the OSHA, moderate contact risk actions include tasks that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission running around the business location, or because the person has recently travelled internationally at a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include staff who have contact with the general public such as schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements. Providing to the staff who have contacts on COVID-19, providing to the staff who have contacts on COVID-19, and providing to the staff who have contacts on COVID-19, providing to the staff who have contacts on COVID-19, providing to the staff who have contacts and to the staffs who have contacts on COVID-19.
In this risk group, personnel are rarely required to use a respirator.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, proper controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person from others by 6 feet, designating a member of the crew to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear usable therapeutic gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, potentially wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other usable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, postpone travel if ill in danger controls and self-isolation and immediately inform the medical center aboard if a person develops fever or other symptoms while boarding the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the isolated person’s room. For schools and infant care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in an absolute school building of community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field tours, meetings and other large gatherings such as cancelling food in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, paralyzing arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is adequate transmission in the local community, extended school holidays can be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel carrying out daily law activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected COVID-19 persons are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during catching, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment before reusing, using household cleaning sprays or wipes, and follow standard operating procedures for the prevention and disposal of used PPE and for the prevention and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care and mortuary personnel to be in high or extremely high categories of exposure risk.
High-risk tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if the personnel perform, collect or handle samples from, the processes that produce aerosols on known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
The processes that produce aerosols include duct insertion, cuff induction processes, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and examinations, or collecting samples from rip-offs.
High exposure-at-risk dead-house tasks include preparing the bodies of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high exposure-at-risk if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include segregation chambers for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including while performing aerosol-generating procedures.
Typical negative pressure convection may be appropriate in some health care and dead-house arrangements.
The samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in different waiting areas. In addition to other PPE, the OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the processes that produce aerosols.
In the U.S., N95 filtering facepiece respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in terms of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who are collecting or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, cloves and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allows only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, only requires the use of PPE required for specific tasks, requires the use of the same respirator without removing during the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, requires the use of the PPE supply chain to observe and coordinate, and facilitate the use of PPE respirators.

Dispatch Date/Time: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
This month there are extraordinary circumstances all around us.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear to all human beings around the world that we have responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community enrichment, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of harmony we have seen among all of our colleagues on emails, calls and chats proves exceptionally how much we have had the privilege of working with extraordinary people.
I am so grateful and proud of all of you as colleagues that I can't put it into words.
Last week, a man shared his appreciation of our work with me.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia at the moment, and how powerful it is to remain online and accessible to all of this vital resource.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or the source of our co-workers’ salaries or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it's the most needed.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, both will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some remarkable changes in the way we work with us this coming week.
Changes in our work and timetables
As Robin pointed out earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our methodology and plan a schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response we had in our thinking to the situation before us, and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to defuse tensions and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to subtract your work, there is nothing wrong with that.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to the doctor, your expertise is our priority.
We are not keeping track of your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
No need to say it, but we are saying it.
You don’t need a sick leave or a PTO – just let your manager know and help your team revise their calendars and schedules to ensure that the main areas of work are not overlooked.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform Brian of the T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you and ensure that appropriate attention is paid to your situation by the management.)
Hourly employees will get full salary.
We have said it before, and we are once again reaffirming our commitment to fulfill our promise to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will get a salary based on their normal working hours during normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick and can’t work, you will get paid.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get rid of the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely gratifying, especially at such a time.
Once again, taking care of yourself is the most important thing.
We ask that you talk to your manager so that we know what to expect, and then we can change accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we can’t stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and Fundraising Teams (and others) do the most important work that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all departments, to assess the existing objectives and to focus our attention on collaborating on the essentials for our mission
We all have a lot to do, we will all just focus on the most essential projects.
By reducing the speed now, we will avoid injury later.
We have no plans to "give double time to compensate" after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that have gone beyond reality.
We believe that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What's with the annual plan?
In order to adjust to our new reality and the expectations of daily working hours, we would like to revise the timeline to meet our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that gives us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and those who need or want to work on a reduced timetable for the next few weeks.
This extension of timeline will bring about a good reduction in our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organization.
We will put our proposal before the Board of Directors next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will inform the representatives and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, contact, and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we deployed antiviral cleaning crews to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
She disinfected every surface, the lobby, and the elevator bank that came up to our floor with the hospital-grade anti-viral solution.
The building is implementing its own care-duty protocols using products that support the safety of its residents.
We are confident that when we return, the office will be fully prepared.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all the DC-based staff members.
Last week, our DC office adopted a completely remote system in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also a discussion of leasing a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are going on but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home/away for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working from home/remote for a long time know that this will require adjustments, and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours increments.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
Define meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send reading material in advance.
Make video your default choice with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and collaboration.
Take the initiative to make every meeting easier, one person monitors the chat for questions and accounts for the speaker list, and one person helps to take notes (or take notes in collaboration)
Send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health reimbursement for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remotes channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is examining the webinar-based labour efficiency guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Editathon, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to meet their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be punished for being constrained to delay or amend those goals.
This coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and community conferences.
This barrier has caused a sense of sadness in the entire global community, but also a sense of relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch on COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are in these situations together and are here to help as much as possible.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information from this email on the Office wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in the countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenge, or if you need help with something else, please feel free to inform the CRT and work with it.
We are here to provide assistance as needed and to help establish a relationship.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Judden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as relinquishment of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition that at this time, our actions and obligations are likely to need to be adapted in a way that we have never done in the past.
We believe these steps are essential to each other’s support, so that we can continue to work, provide our activities with the support they need, and provide the service the world relies on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
At the moment, it’s time to help each other out, and make room for important work to come in the coming weeks and potentially in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doren D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Linette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jenny U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as the entry point in cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing enzyme located on the end layer and surface of other cells.
ACE2 protein consists of the N-terminal peptides M2 domain and the C-terminal collectorin renal amino acid carrier domain.
ACE2 is a once-crossing type I membrane protein with enzymatically active domains uncovered on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the peripheral domain by other enzymes called sheds, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membranes of lung type II aerocytes, small intestine enterocytes, artery and vein intracellular cells, and the tender muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA appearance is also found in the brain vulkut, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a participant of ACE.
ACE decomposes the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and makes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr).
ACE2 can also disintegrate a number of other peptides, including Bradykinin, Epiline, Neurotensin, Dynorphine A, and Grelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the indifferent amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and its role has been reported in Hartnap disease.
As a peripheral protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for certain corona viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-causing virus).
More specifically, the linking of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells leads to the transfer of both viruses and enzymes to endosomes located within the cells.
This penetration process also requires the inhibition of the S protein by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
At the same time, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at a higher risk of pneumonia, especially in people with trauma and heart failure."
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in the mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results were less predominant than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered the new therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour effect process (period).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II increases. Dispersed rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications, designed to assist in contact tracing, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("Contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person, in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about the systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
In the less intrusive option, a user uses Bluetooth signals to log proximity to other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app “StopKorona!” to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. A similar app ("StopCovid") has been employed in Ireland and France as well.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including the wrong positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if the app’s use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited it to only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations to determine what types of organizations could include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after this threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement on such surveillance to the borders.
The organization declared eight conditions on government projects:
Monitoring must be "legitimate, necessary and proportionate";
There should be an exhaustive section for the extension of supervision and monitoring;
The use of the data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data protection and anonymity must be protected and shown to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided to promote discrimination and non-discrimination;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens against abuse and response to abuse;
“Substantial participation” will be required by all “relevant stakeholders” including public health experts and non-authoritarian groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Grenzen) (RSF) have also released the checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of persistent monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; several privacy-protection systems have been created that use central servers only for interoperability (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Several countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-preservation systems.
As of April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protection contact tracing with a large body of research literature from at least 2013 is a well-established concept. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log proximity from a user’s other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that involves both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly contact event numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and other mechanisms for mobile contact tracing.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preservation techniques when collecting and using space or path intersection data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research of the white paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic” released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was originally established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the confidentiality of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that were essentially organized in the context of the same approach and large-scale similar protocols aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving comprehensive adaptation.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has opened-sourced the BlueTrace protocol to be used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and companies controlling Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protector cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three phases:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protection coronavirus tracing apps
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android
Drug repurposing (also known as drug re-profiling, re-profiling, re-appointment or therapeutic alteration) is the re-purposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research instructions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the benefit-related plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of those binding sites provides the proper project to develop effective antiviral drugs to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papen-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain and others studied a number of candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2 anti-medicine with the most similarly approved drugs for the similarity of their structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of New York State’s chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA's process of clinical trials and is only authorized under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
"The use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been established," the CDC said.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and effectiveness of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed Favipiravir to be "clearly effective."
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipiravir and half received omephenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for its stores, and the military would use it to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of disease where the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study by Lopinavir/Ritonavir, a combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were created to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There have been criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources for the repurposing of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activation to protect against multiple phylo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials run by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
The state of New York began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), for the treatment of patients with pre-existing conditions with symptoms of novel coronavirus, is planning a clinical trial for an intravenous corticosteroid for asthma, Tizens Alvesco (Cyclasodeine), for the treatment of asthma.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, running with 200 patients admitted from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anti-snoring tests are being conducted in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is being widely used to treat patients, due to which the Italian drug agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multicentric study on 300 patients who conducted research on the use of anoxaparin sodium on prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the repurposing of approved anti-viral drugs, which were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per the guidelines of Chinese 7th edition
Some of the antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Tests also in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it is not expected to make a vaccine available in less than 18 months to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop the vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, mass planning, and global learning.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were subject to research and development during the start of 2020 to create an effective vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
Advanced major platform goals in Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others are announced, but less public information is available (designed or envisaged in planning).
While the initial safety and immunity tests are carried out in a phase I-II test, this is usually done at random, placebo-controlled and at multiple sites, while prescribing a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring the adverse effects on the optimal dose, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was testing the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify the viral protein to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, the Yansen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Haneke Shutemaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Waxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Waxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the laboratory oncogene in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and are starting trials.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, Nugenerex Immuno-Oncology announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a Li-Ki peptide vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring in Western Maryland both announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced that it was in the development and manufacture of the vaccine.
Novavax will work closely with Inc.
The partners announced plans for preclinical testing and a phase I clinical trial until July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's health ministry announced that they are working with 11 developers, and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on a speedy trajectory.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which is planned for human testing for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Curvac "a large sum of money for the exclusive learning of the COVID-19 vaccine" against which the German government opposed.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop the mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotechnology company Taxis Biotech announced that they would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that trials on their final vaccine candidate could be started by the fall.
On 19 March 2020, in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, including the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development is US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curvac, Innovacio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20 that they were developing a self-adhesive RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically with a plan to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used when other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing of a possible COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVac in mice, stating that "the MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines induced antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice], which began 2 weeks after vaccination were clear."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities accumulated resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have asymmetrical effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits of the disease that they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Preliminary research assessing the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for bio-safety level 3 containment measures to combat the living virus and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection from SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two are adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have sparked a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was aware of and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other breeds of coronaviruses such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be from two to fourteen days.
Although symptoms are mild in most cases, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, often through small droplets generated by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets arise when exhaling out, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than being infectious in long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a dirty surface and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth later.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal cyst.
It is recommended to use masks for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers as well.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not using them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and inhalation.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, dizziness, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical care if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, running nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, initially only chest tightness and sharp beats were observed.
In some cases, the disease can extend to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Notifications indicate that not all contagious individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of non-symptomatic infected people is currently unknown and is being studied, which the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has reported that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic during their stay in hospital.
China's National Health Commission began incorporating asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of the 166 infections that day were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can have a large amount of viral content.
Talking in a loud voice produces more drops than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that droplets that go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) from the uncovered cough can be produced.
Although the virus is not airborne in general, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as duct insertion and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to aerosol formation from respiratory secretions and thus airborne diffusion.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through stools, this risk is considered low. This virus is most infectious when people are symptomatic; although the spread is possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
Yet, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and absorbers are also effective if used correctly; soap products deactivate them by decomposing the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral volume, and the sixth patient showed the highest amount of viral on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 as the viruses reach the nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in lung type II aerial cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "pest" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to somatic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly manifested in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
There has been a high prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venus thromboembolism (25%) in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor prognosis. Body examinations of people dying from COVID-19 have found diffuse aerial damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-used inflammatory external substances within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a follow-up to ACE2-representative epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of somatic hypertension.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secret T-cells were shown to be correlated with the selection of inflammatory IL-6-secret monocytes in COVID-19 patients and with severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal cyst; however, a nasal cyst or mucus cyst may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples to be taken over a two-week interval and the immediate value of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect the active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
In the U.S., the FDA approved the first care-of-place test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Clinical guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University explained ways to detect infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multipolar ground-glass ambiguities with a peripheral, asymmetric and post-transitional transition are common.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination, crazy paving (thickness of the walls with changing aircooler fillers), and condensation may appear.
There are less data available about microscopic lesions and disease body action of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings obtained from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: swelling in the lungs, pericarditis, lung condensation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia can be seen:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperglycemia, large unformed pneumocytes, intravenous inflammation with lymphocytic intramuscular intramuscular and multicenter massive cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Radiated Aerial Damage (DAD) with Radiated Aerial Leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe low-oxygenation.
Treatment of pneumonia: management of leakages and pulmonary intracranial fibrosis in the airways
Blood: Transmitted intervenous sclerosis (DIC); Leucoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, repeatedly and for at least 20 seconds washing hands with soap and water, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of face coverings in public arrangements to partially limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. The social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with infected individuals with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of the management of COVID-19 is to try to mitigate the peak of the pandemic, called "reducing the curve."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
Additionally, it recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where professional hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria spores in alcohol; it is “not an active substance for hand sepsis”.
Glycerin is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and providing assistance to other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled recommendations for treatment from various agencies in a free source, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when aerosol-producing procedures such as duct insertion or hand ventilation are performed.
For health personnel caring for persons infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the person in an airborne infection isolation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE shrimp, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and therapeutic gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial arrangements, but the FDA has authorised masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are made to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness towards a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
The CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other options, but in a few percent of cases they are needed.
The type of respiratory aid for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people hospitalized, with some evidence that high flow nasal penetration or duct penetration with two-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether one of these two offers the same benefits to seriously ill people is not known.
Some physicians prefer to use penetrative mechanical ventilation when available as this technique limits the proliferation of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal ventilation. Serious cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases that make hospitalization necessary.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have finally been admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and it becomes increasingly difficult to provide oxygen.
Pressure control systems and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are required to maximize oxygen distribution while minimizing the risk of lung damage and pneumothorax associated with ventilators.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on possible therapies began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may develop by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
An attempt can be made to give antiviral medication in people with severe disease.
The WHO has recommended volunteers to take part in tests on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA has provisionally allowed health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
No clinical studies have been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting 'near contact' using monitoring data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracing and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
This measure was taken to implement quarantine and to protect those who come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared joint phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to detect those who violated the quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Julio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
“Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and an economic downturn are an ideal storm damaging people’s mental health and well-being,” the BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying.
The disease can have a mild course of action with or without some symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory tract diseases such as common colds.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or severe diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a decrease in data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
Among the most severely affected, COVID-19 can develop rapidly in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, sepsis trauma, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal scurvy and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Snoring abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while in 4% of this group abnormal kidney function is observed.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, the patients transferred to the ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from displaying early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
Tissue pathology examinations of the lung samples of the autopsy show scattered aerial damage with cellular fibromyalgia leaks in both the lungs.
Pneumocytes had seen cell pathology changes from viral to viral.
The picture of the lung appeared similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or heart rate stopping.
According to U.S. March statistics, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the situation vary due to those regional differences and also due to system related difficulties.
The mortality rate can be overestimated due to the low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of cases in the past may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term pathological symptoms of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found lung capacity declines from 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as a potential, depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for the coronavirus have been reported at a later date after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worsening of an untreated infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be of an animal origin that spreads through natural and animal-to-human transmission.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date for the onset of symptoms was reported as 1 December 2019.
WHO's official publications reported the first symptoms on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO determined the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and the disease code U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-incident ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of persons diagnosed dying from a disease, and the Infection Mortality Rate (IFR) which shows the percentage of infected persons dying from a disease (not diagnosed and diagnosed).
These statistics are not timed and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the center of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Aida, in a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, leading to a relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not extreme.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to blood donors evaluated.
The death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 69 (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality varies for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have higher mortality rates in men.
The greatest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is shortened by only 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender gap are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be one of the reasons.
Gender-based immune differences, low prevalence of smoking in women, and developing co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported that CO means coronavirus, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year the outbreak was first identified i.e. 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), species of animals or group of people that are in line with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing degradation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in China's Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as interim names for acute respiratory disease viruses and diseases, which comply with the 2015 guidelines of not using places in disease and virus names.
The formal names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as nasal fahs and parts of ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital immediately needed ventilation valves, and the supplier was unable to provide the required time-frame, a local startup printed the 100 valves needed overnight by doing reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Solidity Trial" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hope of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available at the moment, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First of all, the goal of the researchers is to create a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether passive or dead, aims to generate a human body's quick immune response to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the sub-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-crush protein that helps the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
Vaccines contain a harmless genetic code copied from a disease-causing virus. Antibody-dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted till April 2020.
Seven tests were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine phase III trials on Remdesivir in many countries scheduled to be reported by the end of April, most Chinese research is working on repurposed antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, there was a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonvir and Lopinavir/Ritonvir combined with Interferon Beta.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence for the effectiveness of Remdesivir is available.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with non-approved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. The chloroquine already used for the treatment of malaria was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, calls have been made for a peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice as many doses are extremely dangerous and can be life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection from COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the synthetic ambient SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further studies in organisms after denoting low concentration concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early conjunctivitis protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), intermittently with ACE2 receptor is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2.
There are major limitations to studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Ostalmivir does not condone artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
An increase in the amount of cytokine in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties preventing increased cytokine levels. Tokilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing phase 2 non-random testing nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify an increase in the amount of cytokine, it aims to cope with such aging, which is considered to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA in 2017, a separate cause, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated immune systems produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being examined as a non-vaccination method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral indigestion is the expected mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other procedures, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The health-beneficial serum, which contains the liquid part of the blood of the recovered patients and has specific antibodies to this virus, can be increased for faster planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of intimately related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan's Central Hospital, who became infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
