Welsh AM (assembly member) is concerned with 'mupet-like images'
Some members of the Assembly are hesitant on the suggestion that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (Welsh MP).
The reason for this is that it is planned to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
All the AMs associated with the realm of politics are concerned that it can make them laugh.
A Labour AM spokeswoman said her group was concerned that "it should not be linked to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside of Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
A Plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent" on the name change, but it noted that MWP could be mutated by making small changes verbally in words.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u in the Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal draft on the name change, said: "The final decision of any descriptor in respect of what the members of the Assembly are called will certainly be a matter for the members themselves."
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported on the results of public consultation on proposals that had received much more support for the renaming of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of the title of the AM position, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public advice.
Obviously, AM is suggesting several other options, but with Presiding Officer Elin Jones having a lot of difficulty in getting a consensus, he hopes to present the legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
The legislation, which is being prepared for changes, will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the rules for AM's disqualification and the format of the committee system.
At the time of debating the law making, AM will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonians are going to vote to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
A bid was made for the famous vote to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, a province also known as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighboring country mentions its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, a opponent of the popular vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev, as well as supporters of the referendum, have argued that the name change is only a means of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing due to declining churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said, “The elders with whom I spoke about history say that there used to be more churches on every nook and corner before.”
"Today, everything is ending."
He understands the need to reduce the number of times.
"Today, people's society is being shaped differently," he said.
"The bars are no longer like the neighborhood living room where people go every day."
For churches, they worry that the money they get from selling properties will not last as long as the leaders expected, "and soon these money will be gone or the leaders will come to exactly where they started."
He added that churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of people living in them who would not help in securing the remaining places of worship in the vicinity.
"The number of people buying houses in these buildings will continue to increase and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who are coming to own them will become members of these churches," he said.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin, Harlem’s Black Metropolis—before becoming the Metropolitan Community—both churches were built by the Gore people of religious society.
The original whites of Methodist religious society moved in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious community who used to worship at nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was taken over by a black religious society under the pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, a prominent place for shopping in Harlem, where black people were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the clock began to play here after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's Pastor David Johnson proudly called the ringing of the bell "opening the doors of fortune to the poor."
The expert who played the bell in July described it as something like this: it’s “a cultural heritage” and “an invaluable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who played a huge bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveder said that no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
What happened in St. Martin over the past few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of which were appointed by the general leaders of the church and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
The parish made up of common leaders on vestry (where the items of worship are kept) became the authority - in July the province expressed concern that the province would "demand to meet the costs" for vestry, regardless of whether or not vestry was involved in hiring craftsmen and contractors appointed in the province.
Some priests in the area complained of lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured by an attack by a shark while diving to catch a crab
Officials say a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, at the time he was catching a crab dipping in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach in Ancinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hummel, from San Diego's KSWB-TV, said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time hearing the voice of a boy screaming for help and then he arrived with a group to get him out of the water.
Hummel told him that at first he felt like the boy had voiced in the excitement of catching the crab, but then he realized he was screaming, 'I'm cutting something!'
I'm breaking something!"
Hummel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire uterus was torn.
Hummel said, “I made the sound of everyone getting out of the water: there’s a shark in the water!”
The teenager was admitted to San Diego's Ready Children's Hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.
The attacking shark species has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles said in a conversation with the media that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Gilles further informed that the upper area of the victim's torso is critically injured.
For the purpose of investigation and security, authorities have blocked access from Ponto Beach in Cassblade to Swamys Beach in Assinitas for 48 hours.
Gilles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to include department store-style boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by employing expert assistants with the beauty product.
Despite the continued decline in fashion goods and home goods sales, it is going to join the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty market with good volumes, these large quantities of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the plan succeeds, businesses at more stores will be expanded next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double its offerings from bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup products, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly - this will increase the demand for smaller shoppers to a certain extent.
Additionally, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also examine the special feature in Sainsbury's two stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is due to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e., reduced shifts in the daily quantity of food being sold in the supermarkets.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coupe, said people like department stores at outlets will come in much faster as the supermarket chains are trying to compete with the more services and non-food retailers Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been putting outlets of Argos in hundreds of stores and has also opened several stores since it brought in both chains two years ago, suggesting that sales of groceries have been boosted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to bring beauty and pharmacy products back to the market was a failure.
Sainsbury's did business with Boots in the early 2000s, but had to end this merged business because of the way the revenues from drug stores in their supermarkets split.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy Chain owner Celesio for 125 million pounds, followed by a new strategy.
It said Lloyds will play a key role in the plan by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy as well as several of the best luxury skincare brands in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look-and-feel of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained co-workers who will help us in giving advice.
We’ve built the scope of our brand into more convenient locations according to everyone’s needs and attractive surroundings, which means we’ve reached attractive destinations for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones expresses his displeasure over the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Holly Willubi
In order to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, TV presenter Holly Biluby decided to part ways with a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for Dragons Den star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business, Peter Jones said.
Billubi doesn't have time at all for his homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This 37-year-old Morning Presenter announced the separation on Instagram.
Holly Biluby separated herself from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute with Dragons Den star Peter Jones - so that she could focus on her new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources revealed that when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at Jones' business headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that it was moving away from its new deal - valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - Jones was outraged, it meant that Aboubi had no enough time to give her homewives and accessory.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and it was being considered to double the estimated 11 million pounds to be given by Willubi.
The 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was getting divorced from Truly, after which Jones left the UK to go to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truely was at the top of Holly's priorities ever.
It was supposed to be its long-term future, making this brand much ahead in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in this business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was too close to start.
The warehouse at Marlowe Headquarters is full of goods which are to be sold.
Experts believe the break-up of Britain's richest star could cost the firm several million dollars, as it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and is likely to delay the launch.
It can also end a long friendship.
Biluby's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been quite close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past ten years.
Willubi started Truely in 2016 with Cap and joined the 52-year-old Jones as chairman in March.
Baldwin's TV production firm owns 40 per cent of the holiday couple and Jones.
Billubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin to host I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
"We don't want to talk about their business case," said a source close to Jones last night.
"We've had a lot of discussions and then we've agreed."
Lashing out at the criticism, he said the news media would continue to comment on him, with some viewing it as "a work separate from the presidency" and becoming much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so much sacrifice?
Trump said in his "News Anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anyone."
He said Kim's interest in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June was a major step taken by Trump in the first meeting to make North Korea nuclear-free.
However, nuclear-free negotiations were halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for a "coherent response" from the U.S. to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the U.S. has continued to pressurize to maintain sanctions, he said.
Trump's rally speech saw a much more optimistic approach.
"We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
which killed millions of people.
Now our relationship has become very good."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing a rocket test, helping to free hostages and bringing the remaining American troops back to their homes.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to stay in the presidency, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join the area, we'll have about 200 people to stop them," Trump said, pointing directly to the crowd he had in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia kills hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told for the event that they did not need them.
Despite the devastation of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition for international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly not asking for international help, so it became a bit more challenging," Ms. Sumbu said.
Still, Save the Children visited Palu along with a team, but it is not yet clear whether employees from other countries can come here to offer assistance.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would allow the contribution of the aid effort.
Given such situations repeatedly coming to Indonesia, it seems that there is no preparation at all for an outbreak of nature in this country.
Although shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunamis in Aich, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
There has been a decrease in siren warnings for tsunamis in Palu, no matter how harmful that warning may be, it is likely to increase the loss of life.
Whether it's the best time to visit Indonesia, it's challenging to visit many Indonesian islands.
It is always difficult to arrange goods and services from natural calamities.
The victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment, which is far from Palu and it takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's very poor infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money on improving roads and railways.
However, Mr Joko's administration fell apart due to lack of funds as elections are due to be held again next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than 10,000 became homeless, as Christians and Muslim gangs were fighting each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equates Chelsea with Leaning Mysteriously
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute to save Liverpool from being knocked out of the Premier League.
From a distance of about 30 yards, Sturridge got a pass from Zerdan Shakiri, at that time his team was trailing 1-0 by the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a shot of the far post.
His effort went to the right top corner of the net with height above the box.
Eventually the ball fell out of the catch of Kepa Arijbalaga and went into the net.
"It was just an attempt to get into that position to get in touch with the ball and take it as far away as possible from players like Shake, so I just tried to take as much time as I could for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and touching it once and didn't think too much about it and just hit the shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the halftime after Belgium's best player Aiden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball approached the midfield and Liverpool reached the half-game, Blues striker gave Matteo Covasik a pass in that game.
Kowasik delivered the ball to the midfield very quickly.
Then, they beautifully shot the ball, which led Hazard to the box.
Hazard stepped out of the defense and shot from behind Liverpool's Alison Baker with a left leg away from the net.
Liverpool will now take on Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadion San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 pm in London.

I would also like to appeal to people, especially taxi drivers, who have captured anything on Dashcam footage to contact us because they may have information that is necessary for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed the woman whose body was recovered from the local area of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
The woman's body was found on the spot this afternoon and she was asked where her body was found.
The police are investigating the matter and will soon inform the family of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse is just trying to vacate his flat, but police have reported that no one is allowed inside or outside the building.

The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, re-engraved in history
Its deportation would be the ideal justice for its Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts created by his radical Purinton followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, there was a complete apprehension that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
There was neither an order for the symbol of the English Civil War nor was it made by Cromwell.
It may be wrong that Cromwell may have sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, Cromwell's best representation is evidence of the 19th century idea and part of the history of an idol that many still regard as admirable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps for this reason most people still know him as a defender of Parliament, standing against external pressures in the matter of monarchy at the end of the 19th century.
Yet, he is considered to be the exact representative, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is obvious that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, and the statue of Cromwell remains a personal identity that reflects one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are praiseworthy and memorable.”
The deadly pig attacked a Chinese farmer, killing the farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that only his nickname "Yuan" was identified as the man, his body was found with serious injuries, his body was found lying in blood near a pig-bark in the market in Lipansui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig-fed farmer in Xinjiang, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig-fed herd.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin, who lives in nearby Yunnan province, to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, her cousin died and it was found that a pig-herd door was opened nearby.
She said she saw a very large male pig in the porch with blood on her mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guiang Evening News, her cousin with the nickname "Wu" said, "My cousin's legs were soaked in blood and completely injured."
Security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked the person and killed him was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was kept locked so that it could not attack a person, though police collected evidence to assess the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family members and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
However, earlier also rare cases of attacking people by pigs have been registered.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on their farm causing the person to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife ransacked the animal.
In 2012 an Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs and killed and made his own food, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that generally pigs are not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" if they get a taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite off the teeth and are very searchable... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Heavy rains lash southwestern US due to remaining parts of Cyclone Rosa
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is getting weaker as it moves over the cold waters of Mexico's north coast.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
The wind speed in Rosa was recorded at 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. on Sunday, according to Eastern Time, a Category 1 hurricane, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough has begun forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving towards the west coast of the United States. Since Rosa is due to reach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, much of the tropical moisture in the northern regions of southwestern America will begin to fall.
On Monday, parts of Mexico will receive 10 inches of rain due to Rosa.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough in the coming days will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest with tropical moisture.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, debris flow and landslides in the desert.
The rainfall rate will be 2 to 3 inches at some places, especially in southern Nevada and some parts of Arizona, due to extreme tropical moisture.
Most parts of the southwestern part, especially Arizona, are likely to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the sparse nature of tropical rains, too much flooding can occur with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rains, it will be advisable to stay out of low-lying deserts.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become hazardous rivers and along with the thunderstorm, strong winds and dust will blow over the localities.
Due to the coming trough, some parts of the southern California coast will receive heavy rainfall locally.
A total of more than half an inch of rain is likely to cause some degree of debris flow and slippery conditions on the roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
There will be some slight tropical rains in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
There will be heavy rains in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures across the U.S. may change rapidly in the month of October as the Arctic weather cools down at this time, but the tropics have a lot of heat.
Sometimes this short distance causes strange changes in temperature.
The unusual change in temperatures in the Central U.S. on Sunday is a good example of this.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the weather will begin to warm up and the heat will increase.
Most parts of central and eastern U.S. are expected to receive warmer weather from October which is likely to extend from the southern plains to some areas of the northeast by the 80s.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, about 10 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting signals that the average temperatures in the eastern U.S. are much higher than in the first six months of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who accused Brett Cavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blasey Ford, which was shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political stalemate was also observed, with broadcasters blocking Friday’s Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen’s regular program. The lawsuit was filed after FBI’s Jeff Flake investigated the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was "absolutely sure" that at a high school party, Cavanaugh tried to get him to drink drugs and take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh defended himself, saying he was absolutely sure it didn't happen at all.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people watched Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
Statistics for PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it did not immediately exist.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating those who look in the offices.
From this point of view, this is equivalent to the number of spectators in a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen said that the Fox News channel, which hosts a lot of consideration, supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers present during the entire day's hearing.
The audience on ABC was 3.26 million and it came second.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN.
There was a lot of interest in the audience.
On Friday, Fleck was the central figure in the drama.
A statement issued by the Liberal Republican's office after his tenure said he would raise his voice on behalf of Cavanaugh, who appeared in front of the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, at the time the protesters were shouting to protest the judicial committee's hearing.
When they were being harassed, they stood with their eyes closed for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Let's go, I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think they're telling the country the right thing?"
He was asked, “Have you been brought to power to make a lot of women powerless?”
Fleck said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was closed and that he would be able to keep his full word in the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was forwarding Cavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
However, Fleck said he would do so with a full understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominees next week, which are being urged by the minority Democrats.
Fleck talked about this with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After negotiations with Coons and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck loved power because it was clearly visible that the Republicans would not be able to get the vote without Cavanaugh's approval.
President Trump has given his approval for the FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of being 'politicising' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May asked critics to stop playing with Britain's future by making it a "game of politics" in the European Union and focus their full attention on the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
Right next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, an interview with his former Secretary of State, Boris Johnson, in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on him due to the so-called checkers plan of Brexit, his statement was that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other, which is "absolutely meaningless".
Shooting at Wade Sims: Police detain suspect Dayton Simpson for LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect for shooting and killing at Crazy Sims, a 20-year-old Wade LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge police department said the 20-year-old Diaton Simpson was taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder.
The video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released by authorities, and police reported that Sims had lost his glasses at the time of the encounter.
Police have recovered the glasses from the spot and said that according to the WAFB report attached to CBS, DNA belongs to Simpson.
Simpson was questioned by the police, who said he fired a fatal shot to kill the madman.
The lawyer's report said he was set up for $350,000.
A preliminary report released by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office on Friday said the death was caused by a bullet in the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and people from the area who have contributed to the investigation for custody.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Allleva thanked the law enforcement in the area for its "difficulty and pursuit of justice."
Simmons was 20 years old.
Her length was 6 feet 6 inches, she grew up in Baton Rouge, where her father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had gained 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the previous season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that Wade's death left the team "dispersed" and "very sad."
“Who will replace him now will always be worried,” Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano has been found in southern Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano and said that 183 cases of gas and ash have been recorded in 24 hours.
Many shocks and vibrations were monitored at the centre.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshield in the neighborhood of Mexico City, like Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico, since then geophysicists have paid attention to the growing activity of the volcano that lies 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The "Don Goo" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists in Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were detained after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of protesters took part in the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on isolation.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powder paint on the riot police, causing road dust to turn black, causing inconvenience to commuters in general.
Police used batons to control the clashes and later resorted to scuffle.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "no mistakes, no apologies" while protesters chanted "Spain remains immortal."
According to a local press report, fourteen people who were injured due to the protest were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal, has been escalating tensions in independent areas for over a year, but Catalonian separatists were celebrating it.
Voters opted for a very good way for independence, although there were few who strongly opposed the vote against secession.
Catalonia officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
The freedom-affirming groups stayed there overnight on Friday to help the National Police to stop the protests.
The demonstration was pushed forward, but he was forced to make a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narciss Terminus, along with his wife, had arrived to take part in a separatist protest, saying he did not see any possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Our best year was last year.
"I saw my parents cheering by voting, but it seems we're stuck now," he said.
Despite a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia’s pro-independence parties struggled this year with many of their most famous leaders to maintain influence, whether in exposing themselves or in waiting for the blockade of their role for the continued declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to help police, said the clashes between politicians on both sides had been halted.
She said, "It's become too stressful."
On Saturday, Orol Junqueras, one of nine leaders from Catalonia who has been in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would fight in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the return that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
London Derry: People who attacked the house by car have been detained
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested on charges of repeatedly assaulting a car at a London Derry home.
The incident took place at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blamings said the doors and buildings were damaged.
In some places the crossbow may have been attacked by a car.
Menga beats Rangers to take 1-0 lead
Dolly Meng's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the Ibrox club, Livingston surprised the Rangers with Steven Gerrard taking responsibility for his second loss in 18 matches.
Dolly Mengga's strike made the difference that Gary Holt's side move equalled with Hiberian in the second half of the match.
Gerrard's side was one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the Leaders Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, last month, bringing head coach Holt to replace Kenny Miller, Livingston has been consistently winning in the six-game division.
Livingston missed out on showing his game to the visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead a long time before scoring, as well, because of their great game, the Rangers had a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but was lagging behind with an effort to score, then Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his best effort after slipping to finish the goal in Craig Lightfoot's header.
The hosts had a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put visitors in trouble on set pieces.
And because of this, he got an important goal.
The Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson did the job of setting up Menga, who made a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had consolidated their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was far behind.
The pattern continued even in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos insisted on Kelly being saved.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor from the feet and Lithgow completely captured the game by flicking from the second Livingston.
Crosses in the Livingston box continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while after the lightweight challenge, two penalty claims were made, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on the handball.
Analysis of Livingston's 'extraordinary goal'
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont has been inducted into the Tony Macaroni Arena.
The extraordinary performances and results of Livingston.
For anyone, they were great, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing traction.
His way of playing and personality have changed dramatically since his return from the top flight, but the most credit goes to Holt's way of shaping the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of good players.
Captain Lightfoot was a great player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worl behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in Rangers.
The kind of fine performance he has performed many times under Gerard was less than his standard.
Their final ball was lacking - they were only able to cut to their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up call for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was welcomed together in Cologne.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the smiles were scattered, but to no avail.
This is President Erdogan's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations with NATO allies.
He remained embroiled in controversies on a range of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's insurgency in the EU.
After that, Erdogan spoke about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, the city is one of the areas with the largest number of Turkish residents.
Police stopped 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who opposed Erdogan - some of whom were also Kurds - also shouted slogans, strongly condemned Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The two-way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom regarded him as a German Turk hero and others disrespected him by calling him a voluntary ruler.
Cyclist dies in road accident in Deptford
In London, a cyclist died after being hit by a car.
The accident took place in the southeastern part of the city at about 10:15 BST, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a walk-in street in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him first aid, but the person died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago due to a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Such incidents are taking place due to the diversion of the bus and the drivers have been advised to avoid going to such areas.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured due to disturbances
The jail office said six jail officials were injured in the high-security men's prison mess.
At around 09:30 BST on Sunday, something went wrong at Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin and continues to do so.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called to fix the mess, this mess is in a wing in which eight prisoners are placed.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the spot which was treated.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to repair the accident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the injured have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that the persons responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they may be imprisoned.”
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of these prisoners are among the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the jail governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the jail governor was treated in a hospital.
In addition, riot officials were called to jail in October last year to fix a serious clutter, during which the staff from the pool ball was attacked.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical conditions remain a threat after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but it is very likely that it is the same that could affect the remaining capacity of the storm in the coming weeks, putting it at risk of flooding the Desert Southwest.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that flash floods are expected in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as in the southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah of western Arizona.
The rains on Monday evening are expected to leave Rosa straight through the entire Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the storm AZ border.”
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that the Mogollon rim in Arizona could receive up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, as well as up to 6 inches.
The central Rockies and the Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, as well as 4 inches of it.
Outside areas at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rains can prove to be a boon because of the drought in the area.
Though the floods remain a serious concern, there is still a drought situation in the Southwest, which is likely to benefit greatly from the rains.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is very dry, making it the second-highest category of drought," the weather.com report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
On Sunday morning, the maximum wind speed of Cyclone Rosa was 85 mph, at which time it was 385 mph south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is currently moving northwards at a speed of 12 mph.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific region due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the power of the tropical storm could cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains are likely in some parts of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
"It is expected that rainfall from Baja California to northwestern Sonora may range from 3 to 6 inches, as well as, it is expected to be 10 inches," the weather.com report said.
After that, Rosa will make a tropical storm and travel across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border northwards on Tuesday morning, after which it will move southwards into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The biggest threat from Rosa or its remaining parts is to Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rain is likely,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these rains are likely to endanger peoples lives and landslides in mountainous areas due to heavy flooding and debris flowing in the deserts.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four people detained for plotting murder
A 16-year-old minor in Somerset was found in an injured state with a knife for which three suspected teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been detained in an attempt to murder.
The teenager was found in an injured condition in the Axelsier Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital for treatment where his condition is stated to be "okay."
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight from the Redstock area.
Officials have also appealed to people to contact them if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump calls Kavanaugh's trouble the Democratic Party's fury
“Justice Kavanaugh is a man who has been rejected by the brutal and humiliating tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says the trouble that Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared the Congress for what Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually harassing Ford in her teens several decades ago, which Kavanaugh has forcibly and emotionally refuted during her purported clean-up.
During the hearing, Ford also testified about the allegation.
“The people of the United States saw the virtue and courage of being the finest human being of Kwanzaa that day,” the President said on Saturday.
To a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "Voting Justice Kavanaugh means voting for a man who is the most accomplished lawmaker of our time, he can affirm the law and do justice with the real record of public service."
Speaking on the importance of the Republican vote in the medieval elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh.
"There are only five weeks left now, from the election that is most important to our lives.
I'm not in it, but I'm actually in it," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are really qualified."
Trump said the Democrats are on a campaign to "protest and block."
A senior GOP colleague told CNN that the Senate's first countdown for Kawanogh's nomination is set to begin on Friday.
Earthquake in Indonesia kills hundreds, death toll rises
When a huge earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, high waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died, officials said.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of Palu city in which hundreds of people gathered, when the six-metre (18-foot) high waves rose after the evening curfew, triggered a catastrophe that killed many people and destroyed everything around them.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the tsunami risked, people in the middle were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately and were trapped,” said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB at briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not only caused by the deaths of people, but it also dragged cars, logs and houses to the ground. Before the attack on the beach, the tsunami travelled at an open sea speed of 800 km per hour (497 mph).
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami, he said.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Photos posted by the disaster agency from the plane showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque also surrounded by water.
The post-harvest tremors continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
Around 2.4 million people in the area experienced a persistent earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the capacity of the energy emanating from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said that the geography of the city situated on the edge of a long, narrow bay could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho explained the damage, saying it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said the bodies of some people were trapped in the debris of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people were unidentified.
The damage is very likely to occur in Dongla, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, near the epicenter of the quake, Nugroho said.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in Dongla was "completely damaged."
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living here and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
"It's already a tragic event, but it could be even more terrible," it said.
On Saturday, the agency criticised why it had not been informed earlier if the tsunami was about to hit Palu, although officials said the warning was about to be issued but the waves had already started.
A person amateurly created some videos and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the position on the upper floor of the building was giving a person a voice to the people on the street downstairs and in it can be heard a frightening warning.
Within a few minutes, too much water began to flow out of the middle and the buildings and cars were pulled along with them.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut off communication lines, making it difficult for authorities to combine rescue efforts together.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have started sending cargo planes, officials said, adding that there is still a need to evacuate people and meet other requirements as well as food.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Mr. Doseba informed that the World Vision staff at Donghala made every effort to make Palu city safer, the staff have been living in it by constructing tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have witnessed the devastation with their own eyes.
"On talking to him, it was revealed that he saw many houses being destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
The aid groups seriously started bringing supplies for disaster relief, with some complaining that outside aid workers with specialised expertise were being denied access to Palu.
According to Indonesia's rules, money, any goods, and employee's help from abroad can only be taken if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
However, this has not been done yet.
"This disaster is still at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has said that it is a national disaster, only then can we involve international aid personnel in rescue operations but that has not happened yet."
People whose friends and family members were not traced in Palu, even after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, were hoping that their loved ones would be miraculously reunited as it happened after natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was found that a small boy was trapped in the sewer.
The rescue team rescued a woman from the debris on Sunday and her baby was trapped in the debris for two days next to her.
Gandon Subando, the coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, trained two paragliders of the Asian game to locate the lost, who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandgi along with his students was among those stranded at the Roha Roha Hotel.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally suppressed," he said.
Gendon said the paragliding community started its work only after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roma hotel was received, sending messages via WhatsApp to Palo contestants participating in the festival.
However, only gray marks are visible on his message, not blue marks on it.
"I think that means the message didn't reach people," he said.
Thieves looted $26,750 at Levy's Newport ATM
A Brink employee was putting money into an ATM in Levy's Newport on Friday morning, while the thieves stole $26,750, according to a report issued by the Newport Police Department.
Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money in.
While he was busy with his work, “someone ran from behind the Brink’s employee” came and ran away with a bag of money kept to put in.
A number of people present at the spot are suspected, but police are yet to ascertain the total number of people present at the spot.
Anyone who has information related to their identity should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name.
About the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "Formally his name will remain Kanye West."
The 41-year-old has named himself for a while and will use the name for the title of his eighth album, Monikar, which was released in June.
The change is being made in his presence in Saturday's Night Live, where he is expected to start his new album Yandy.
The show's producer said he has removed singer Ariana Grande from the show, who refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
In addition to shortening his current professional name, West had already stated that the term had religious significance for him.
Speaking on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy, West said earlier this year, "I believe that the word 'y' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
"That's why I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The word is derived from Kanye, which means only one, which is this - it refers to our good, our evil, our delusion, everything.
The album shows who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has named them Love and Brother Love while announcing for the name.
An old friend of the West, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians on his 50th anniversary of the country's deadly retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Teltelco Plaza promised that “the military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the peaceful movement in Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when left-wing students' movements were spreading across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support the youth of Mexico, they will give grants every month to students studying and open more and more free government universities.
He said that due to unemployment and less opportunities for education, young people become among the perpetrators of crime.
The U.S. should double the amount of funds given to AI
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area, said Kai-Fu Li, a low-income investor and AI businessman for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The AI made the comment after a series of U.S. government work, saying that the U.S. lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: it aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling AI research budgets will give a great start, look at all the other countries apart, so the U.S. is far behind in this case, and we are making efforts for AI’s next success,” Lee said.
"Doubling the fund could double the chances that AI's next major achievement will be in the U.S.," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Huton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, is an investor in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of the best AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was appointed to the position of Executive in Microsoft Research and President in Google's China branch.
Lee outlined the technical competencies of the previous U.S. government, including the robotic challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who would be the next government that would identify the next visionary.
Lee said U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
“It’s not China removing academic leaders, it’s corporate,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired giants from the university to work on AI.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could help the U.S. in its AI efforts.
“In my opinion, permission to do PhD in AI through green card should be obtained automatically,” he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"China's National Natural Science Foundation grants economic grants to researchers from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations in the same way that the people of the Academic Institute are funded, but the quality of education in China is not very good," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA this month launched an initiative called AI Next that talked about $2 billion investment.
For NSF, this investment right now is more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a law was enacted in the U.S. that the demand for the creation of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
Macedonians voted to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a work that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece, which led to Greece banning its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, which says its northern neighbor has its name on its territory, giving it two names for the same bid and is already part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments made a deal in June based on the new name suggested, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said the renaming of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of Slavic people.
President Guzmán Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and boycott the campaign, raising doubts that only a minimum of 50 percent of the votes required for the vote would be valid.
On the voting ballot the question would be written: “Do you give your approval for an agreement with Greece for membership of NATO and the EU?”
Supporters of the name change, as well as Prime Minister Zoran Zev, say Macedonia needs to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, this will allow them to live independently in the EU’s umbrella because it means a safe life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
While not legally pushing for it, most members of parliament say they will act in accordance with the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is required for a name change in Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities were reported till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary elections were held in 2016, voting was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, of which 66 per cent registered voters cast their votes.
Gozo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje, said, “I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev went to Macedonia with his wife Zorika and son Dushko to vote for a change in the country's name, so that on September 30, 2018, the country's name in Stromica, Macedonia, would join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Coverdarkov, a resident of Skopje, was preparing a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents of those who were opposed to the vote.
“We must have NATO and EU membership, but we want to be involved by raising our heads and not by means of an agreement,” Kavdarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
"If they don't want us to subscribe in the name of Macedonia, no matter what, we can become part of the Euro-Asia integration by joining other countries like China and Russia."
Prime Minister Zeve has said that membership in NATO will give Macedonia a much-needed investment, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think a lot of votes will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO," Zeve said after casting his vote.
He said the "yes" result would "confirm our future."
A survey published by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would vote in the required turnout.
A second survey conducted by Macedonia's Telema TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Of them, 70 percent agree to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent voting is required to be successful.
If the vote fails, the Western Government's policy to be formed in May last year will be the first serious blow.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score goals
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling defended Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Ironically, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in the midfield in the early stages.
As he landed in the open field, he defended three Brighton players.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a player who defended before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, Aguero used his left boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball got out of his right side and went into the net.
“Aguero has had some problems in his legs that he is upset about,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter.
"We talked for 55, 60 minutes about their game.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time.
But, it was because of Stirling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He took the ball beautifully off the left side of Leroy Sen.
Sen touched a few before sending away Sterling, who was playing well.
Just before the game slips out of hand, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League Group Play will now take on Hoffenheim at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhine-Necker-Arena in Cincinnati, Germany.
Sherlock wants to play against the Rockies.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no big reason to insist on another start.
But, the always-contesting skaters hope that on Sunday they will score big against the Colorado Rockies, but the playoffs for the Rockies remain just a possibility, winning the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won a wild-card spot on Friday night by registering a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Even if we're not playing great, but at least we can play to know that Denver's atmosphere of crowded and second team will probably be for the highest level of play I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that game?"
The Nationals are still to be told about the starter for Sunday, but it is being heard that Shazer could be included in such a situation.
Shazer, who played for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander was at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm election, the President referred to the situation around his Supreme Court in Lakshadweep to Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work we have done will be at stake in November.
There are only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a huge election - I'm not involved in it, but really I'm involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates," he said.
Trump added: "You can look at this much more terrifying radical group of Democrats, you can look at everything that's happening right now.
Moreover, they are trying to grab power by using other necessary means, which you know is useless and useless.
To get power and control, they don't care who's sad, who's capable of it, they just want power and control, but we won't let that happen."
He said the Democrats' campaign is "opposition and obstruction."
"Besides, you can see what has happened in the last four days, the anger of the Democrats you saw and also how mean and bad they are," he said.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee as the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, which was highly appreciated by the audience.
"Remember his answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for that thing -- whose body language was really bad -- such a bad body language I saw for the first time."
Working is no longer a broad church.
For those who speak their mind, it is not worth tolerating
When the workers who led my local party voted to elect me, it was a huge surprise for me.
After all, I’m the newest among the Labour MPs whose importance has been greatly diminished – we can’t say all of our minds.
This is what happened to my MP colleague, John Ryan, because he too had raised his voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, there were inherently similar problems in Europe that Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
For the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday, “we want all things to be included in the meeting and be beneficial.”
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, most of the time I have seen that the Friday Night GC meeting was exactly the same.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus in many meetings today and or the promise that the politics of "compassionate and gentle people" is actually forgotten, happened here too.
It is clear that if there are different views in the Labour Party, then they are not tolerated and for every consideration a decision is taken on whether it is eligible for approval for the party leadership.
This is what started immediately after Jeremy became the leader, the allies for whom I had previously thought he had a political opinion like mine, began to expect me to turn back from my own words and work in positions I could never agree with - whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - bad words are seen on social media, sharp comments are made on it, centre politics is condemned and I am told that I am not worthy of the Labour Party.
Besides, it’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are political.
I know how businessmen work and am dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but do not shy away from raising voices.
There are many frustrating aspects in today’s political age, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and every proposal of "disbelief" or changes in the party's selection rule has been greatly reduced.
Over the last two years, many people have advised me and urged me to remain silent, not to speak too much, and then I will "be honest."
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was engaged in labour as a school student, I was encouraged to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to completely abandon my school’s broader classroom, I demanded better public services to those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never concealed any of my politics, including the politics I had in the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area that disagrees with my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that harms homes, businesses and our public services, I don't think it's necessary for the Labour Party to waste my time and my energy in showing its honesty.
But, in fact, I have a message that isn't for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my supporters, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud that I'm serving you, and I promise that my work can't create any kind of disastrous risk or political campaign disruption, I'm just interested in things that interest you all.

Ir 38 - 17 Melrose: Unchained Ir reaches the top
The two late attempts could have some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ir Tennant deserved to win in this best entertaining match of the Premiership.
Now they are just at the top of the table of ten undefeated side.
In the end, their defense was great, they found the best opportunity they could get, which allowed them to take the home team forward and give coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
“We’ve thoroughly examined our game and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robin Christie reported: “The credit goes to Ayer, who capitalized on his opportunity as much as possible.”
With Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort, Fraser Clemo had to face Aier, but Variers gave Scotland's Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which Melrose gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Bagen reaped a very difficult effort.
With the help of a penalty right before half-time, Clemo raised the Ir, he scored and then tried to sideline the match 17-5 for Ir at the break time.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was turned into a goal by Baggot, reducing Lewes' five points.
After that, Ruridih Knott suffered a serious injury that caused him to stop the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the start of the game Ayer went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowell which Clemo converted into a goal.
At the time, Ayer's team captain, Blair McPherson, had received the yellow card, and Melrose then gave an effort to extra man Bruce Colvin, who failed to capitalize on it due to too much pressure at the end of the game.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for facing Billa Ball's Climo from the penalty line-out, McPherson hit the back-to-back touchdown.
After Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent Flanker Gregor Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home side, Clemo turned it into a goal, as they could when the game resumed.
Stars of the game are still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
The game's star Ford Kieran is still looking for a way to get into the hospitality industry, some time ago it was revealed that he was selected for the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is associated with the Jarvis famous BBC show, in which he works as a writer and has already collaborated with comedy partner Greg Hemphyll in his acting.
The two have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show's world, and it seems that they are planning what to do after Kerrnan's Kreegleng.
On the basis of the official record list, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a source from a Scottish Sun indicated that Kieran wanted to join a "great restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': Land-restricted Bolivia hopes court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Military personnel are patrolling extensively at the Naval Headquarters of La Paz.
Ocean-blue flags are being hoisted on government buildings.
Here is a slogan of the naval base stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: "We have rights over the sea."
It is our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the terrible land struggle of the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land – they want to wave their flag in the Pacific Ocean once again.
He now hopes to regain his Bolivian land decades ago, as it awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“There is a lot of enthusiasm in Bolivia now, a sense of unity and peace here, and the hopes of the people here are going to have a positive outcome,” said Diplomat Roberto Calazilla of Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's big decision on a large screen across the country, hoping that the decision from the Hague court will be in favour of Bolivia - which has been negotiated for decades - forcing Chile through negotiations to return the Bolivian land to the sea.
Bolivia's finest president, Evo Morales, who is set to face a controversial contest in next year's re-election, also expressed optimism in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean," he said last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and if the decision is in Bolivia's interest, there will be plenty of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to reward the Chilean province, and it has decided that the possible outcomes of the talks will not be determined.
Chilean expert in the International Court of Justice, Paz Zret, said the ICJ's decision would come six months after the final negotiations, in which the hearings indicated that the case was "not complicated."
In addition, apart from the conditions of Bolivia, the last four years seem like it may come back to the old position.
“The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current Bolivian government,” Jarrett said.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement has put an end to Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision is made.
The ambassadors of the two countries have not lived in each other's country since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, who is in The Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually fast.
He said Monday would be a "best opportunity" for Bolivia to open new avenues of relations with Chile, and an "opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
Calazilla has dismissed that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was doing politics on the maritime issue.
"Bolivia will never back down for its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"Decision is a chance to go about what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea has said it will not stop nuclear testing until it has confidence in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his country will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it has confidence in Washington.
Ri delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit between the leaders of other countries in Singapore.
He remarked that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be resuming nuclear diplomacy after more than three months of North Korea's Kim Jong Un's promises in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would be considered a North defeat by sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the consensus of an already-running important disarmament campaign without the declaration of Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both wish that there be another summit.
But, it is completely skeptical that Pyongyang is serious about ending its nuclear bomb inspection because they do not want to jeopardize the country’s security.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which is expected to be held by both Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show featured a variety of new-designed headwear for your nearest High Street.
If you have to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from the sun, then there is no need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Thom Browne have created a series of great headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that featured at the Paris Fashion Week.
The best profitable hats have been created to avoid this year’s heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show off on the show.
The finest hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with wings-like wide brims that hung around the model's head.
The second accessory with a very large side included a bezel design made of watermelon hats, wizard hats, and pineapple-designed hats - but they aren't built to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Brown also showed special design masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colorful masks and saw things more like the Hannibal Laker than the Haute Couture.
One of the creations saw all sorts of objects for scuba diving, including snowballs and glasses, while the other saw a design with melted ice cream cones.
Also, if you've seen a bigger fashion - you're lucky.
Style-seeing amateurs anticipate that this great collection will soon reach out to the finest shops around you.
The very large-sized hat will come with a La Bomba design heel, a two-foot-wide brim straw hat from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Behind the finest effective hat was a kult label that looked pretty, with a second creation catwalk posted on social media - showing a model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Raffia bag was trimmed with Raffia Fringing and had a white leather handle, which was one of the best attractions of Jacquemus's La Rivera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the fashion's famous celebrity, told FEMALE: "I hope big hats and beach bags will come out in stores soon for the upcoming summer season - because designers have been so impressed by this that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for citizens of foreign countries
Private schools in Scotland keep track of the track record of excellent education, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver excellent test results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under whose leadership these schools are striving to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement school curriculum, we see that schools continue to choose modern languages as an alternative to popular and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, you’re good for him.”
If you talk to her in her language, she loves her heart."
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we feel we can rely more on English.
In the recent examination results of this year, we can see that the languages with the highest passing rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
68% of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS can be seen from 72 percent of students secured the highest grade A in the Mandarin language, while 72 percent of students secured the highest grade A in the German language, 69 percent in the French language and 63 percent in the Spanish language.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included in the curriculum of private schools as optional subjects and other subjects like STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that employers struggled hard to recruit employees in vacant positions, with 17 percent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative to have more and more language skills to prepare young people for their future careers.
Because of the high potential employment opportunities that require language, these skills are essential to work anywhere in the world.
Regardless of the choice of career, if people have learned another language, such skills will definitely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, being a multilingual person, you will automatically be ahead of the competition.
More than 4,000 adults in the UK took part in the YouGov survey in 2013, according to which 75 percent did not speak a foreign language enough and French was the only subject that was spoken by 15 percent and was the only language to reach double-digit percentages.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching language to children today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of countries with developing economies, will enable children to have better opportunities to find the right jobs.
Languages taught in every school in Scotland will be different.
There are many schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that have a outlook towards 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also find staff teaching it who are experts in the field.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need for success so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be ranked better in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as “international communication skills.”
Scotland’s young people will continue to be given the choice to choose this option, diversity and excellence by private schools.
It proved to be fair.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

"They'll play at least one minute and a maximum of 48 minutes," Lears said through the official website.
"Mike Trudel, Leicester Correspondent, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.

"At this stage of my career, I don't have to be ready for the preseason game," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump held a lot of rallies for the campaign tonight.
Next week, Trump has set up five more rallies, including in Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favorable venues.
With a moratorium on the vote set out in his election for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump's goal is to seek help for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk being out of Congress' control at the time of the November vote count.
When will Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
Trump's rally to be held in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled tonight at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is likely to deliver a speech at this week's hearing, with the confirmation of the Senate vote expected for a week during the FIT investigation over allegations of sexual offences against Kavanaugh.
But the main goal of this tense rally is to help Republicans face the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump said, “The five rallies next week are aimed at zealous volunteers and supporters as a Republican effort to protect and increase their stalled majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
According to Reuters, a spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress control has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit states where the season of our campaign will be very busy."
“Definitely in the Vesbanco Arena of Wheeling, tonight’s rally can bring the attention of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to help candidate Patrick Morris, who lags behind in the West Virginia Republican Senate survey.
“If the president has to try to give Morris a lead in the election, that’s not a good sign for him,” said Simon Haider, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed a willingness to compete to keep their hopes on top in the Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will see the outcome of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The passage of time is a completely new concept for the players, but in competitions like these, it is impossible to predict when a player will be ahead and who will be trusted.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead that is now four, so I think we have to increase our pace a little bit,” Jordan Spieth told The Walking Dead.
Of course, Europe took advantage and went ahead by four points with 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel they have little chance left and a lot to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played all day together and both earned three points out of four from their game.
Spieth from tea to green is deadly to everyone and also the best in the game.
As their game progressed, people cheered cheerfully, clapping when they and Thomas went down two more points after two, putting in the key to finishing four all-square.
It was because of his putt that his team got into the 15th position with a similar scree, the sort that tells you that you don't think the American team is out of it.
"You just have to play really well and take care that the win is yours," said Spieth.
That's what they call all the players who have been out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, there have been only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, named Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are making history in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different-sized but better-looking couples got four points in four and are at the forefront.
"Mollywood" on Saturday afternoon was the only pair that didn't shoot any bogies, but they stayed away from the bogies until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning before nine o'clock.
On Sunday, that run and the way to get that run came in this strong crowd and from this strong crowd as if they were beating players, and there is no player who could turn a possible European team's victory into a defeat.
It is good that the two are on different holes in different ways.
However, European dignity has been talked about a lot in advance.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball's hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at the time their pairing was made with Alex Noren.
A bogey in front of nine dugs and two doubles by Spaniards and Swedes, they had never been able to get here before.
However, on Sunday there was no one to help you get to your hole.
Foreball and foursome were great at watching because the interaction between pairings was great, he advised that he did not need to consult and was well aware of how to change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead on the final day, but this four-day session also showed that the team USA has the potential to compete in a way that is doubtful, especially in the Statesside.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead.
Europe will take advantage of it on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead over the United States on Saturday.
The best pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over Tiger Woods, struggling with two victories, so that they could beat Le Golf National's four points.
To avenge his loss of the trophy two years ago in Hazeltine, Thomas Bjorn's European Side was dominated by the American Side's misfiring of the morning foreball, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed greater resistance in the foursome, winning two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles match to maintain the trophy's victory.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari made their debut with "Mollywood" after the Sensational Weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in their opening four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reid in the foreball, they again beat the best player Woods and the American Rukia Bryson Deshmukh by 5 and 4 points, performing better than ever before.
Woods, who led himself through two games on Saturday, showed his best performance, but has now lost 29 of his four-match and 19 of his seven Roe matches.
In the rest of the morning foreball, Justin Rose returned to the foursome with his partner Henrik Stenson and beat world number one Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, in the South West of Paris, the Pleasant, Breezy Day, Europe had no break from it.
Leading players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times on Saturday, set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points.
He won a 2-1 victory over John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the foreball and sent Pauls and Rory McLeroy back 4-3 in the opening two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team returned from a singles match with four points, although the way Furyck's side needed it, it caught everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack on Sunday after being second-best for two days is going to be as different from their old game.
"North Korea says there is no ""way"" to disarmament is only one side that cannot be trusted."
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations continued sanctions that depended on its mistrust in the United States and showed no way to stop the country from inspecting the nuclear bomb on its own.
At the World Body's Annual General Assembly last year, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had tried a number of "significant goodwill" methods, such as stopping nuclear bombs and missile tests, demolishing the site of nuclear bomb tests, and promising not to further the work of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any response from the US," he said.
"There will be no confidence in our national security without relying on the U.S. in any way and there is no way in such situations that we can unilaterally begin disarmament."
While Ri reiterated that North Korea's complaints are about Washington's "phased" approach to disarmament, under which North Korea will gradually reap the benefits, his statement makes it perfectly clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left to one side alone as Pyongyang has done before.
At a summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader serving in Singapore on June 12, Ri referred to the statement made jointly by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which time Kim vowed to work towards "disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first stop building its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the lifting of strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has first emphasised disarmament and increased the level of pressure on sanctions so that it can achieve its objective forcefully, and at the same time, it has also objected to a "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"Restraint can tilt us, such a notion is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that the constant ban is undermining our confidence."
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, he said, adding that the U.S. leader last week spoke of the UN's strengths.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and further stated: “If the party for this disarmament problem is South Korea and not the U.S., then the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not be involved in such a standoff.”
Still, Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he said about the U.N. National Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets after Trump, the "Mr. Evil President" who called the "Rocket Man" on the suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim's courage to stand up for disarmament but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he had no deadlines set for this, “if it takes two years, three years or even five years—it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the UN Security Council.
However, on Thursday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: “The Security Council sanctions should remain in place until without any failure we realize that we are completely, last, and verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has extended sanctions on North Korea with full consent in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ree at the UN General Assembly and then told that he would go to Pyongyang again next month for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his previous visit was not good.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, with North Korea condemning them for "gangster-like demands" within just a few hours.
At this month's Moon meeting, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts "compliant measures" it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
He pointed out that while Kim had promised him "compatible measures," they were seeking a guarantee of security that Trump would take resolutions in Singapore and that they would move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses for a job that is comfortable enough
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get as much rest as possible while competing in a growing Macho culture for study through all-nighters, fueled by caffeine.
A teacher who teaches students at the number one university in the world often has no choice when it comes to what to do to relax.
Charles Kazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course for which he believes this is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the effects of low sleep at the time of teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
She told The Telegraph, “I got a girl at the end of the year and she said: ‘Why do I say that every time I have to go to class next year?’
She told me that no one told her about the importance of sleep, which shocked me.
For the first time this year, students will learn about the importance of good sleep habits in studies, writing and athletic performance, besides improving their general health.
"""Students don't get enough sleep every week for which the university decided to start the course,"" said Paul Barrera, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Services."
The course lasts for hours and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to tell what effect caffeine and light will have on and what kind of effect a lack of sleep will have on athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleeping time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then the participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
"""We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately,"" said Professor Zeesler."
But, we believe that they should be aware of this - just as smoking cigarettes is about health.
He said the culture of feeling proud of "reading all night long" still exists, with modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less, which has become a growing problem.
Whether or not you sleep enough and get a good night’s sleep is like a ‘secret weapon’ of the pupils, which can counter stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – it also protects against the impact on weight because lack of sleep makes their brains constantly think about hunger that makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jessler build the course, completing his last year's class at Harvard last year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and was motivated for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that it will be considered necessary for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Jessler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before going to bed, as well as deciding when they should wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emanating from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put too much circadian on them, causing sleep problems.
Livingston's Rangers 1 - 0: Menga scored against Gerard
Due to Dolly Manga's strike, the Rangers faced trouble in another match, putting the responsibility of Livingston's 1-0 win on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
Ibro Side was looking for his first win after a 4-1 win in the match played at St John's in February, but Gary Holt's team instigated Gerard as manager for the second defeat in 18 games to exclude Landbrokes Premiership leader Herts by eight points.
Menga striked for seven minutes before half-time and then Rangers' line-up shorts didn't even get a chance to equalize the game.
However, Rangers have now fallen to sixth place in the rankings, with Livingston reaching third and only behind the Hibernian due to the goal difference.
In addition, the game could be even more troublesome for Rangers since Linesman Callum Spence's head injury has been treated since the object was clearly thrown at the other end.
The eight changes to Gerrard's side gave the previous Ir a chance to make it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livy 11 that took a point of the Hurts last week and the way they drilled well caused trouble for the opposition team at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first latched off and sent Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goal, he should have given him just two minutes, but the midfielder capitalized on the big opportunity he had found.
When Keagan Jacobs, who was in the deep, made a free-kick, the kick went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow, who was in the back post, could only widen the stab.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, they had more confidence in their game than expected.
Of course, Alfredo Morelos felt he should have imposed a penalty on the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless clashed with each other, but referee Steven Thomson denied the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers saved two shots on target in the first-half but Liam Kelly, a former eyebrows goalkeeper, faced difficulties with Lasana Colibli's header and Twi OV Ezaria's strike.
However, in the 34th minute, Livi's opener could go against the run-off game, but no one can deny that he alone is entitled to the graft.
Even then, the best player in Rangers Deep couldn't beat Jacob.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in him, Scott Robinson kept Manga cool to pick up for a simple finish.
When Gerrard swapped the callibel for Ryan Kent and switched to show effect immediately as he was slotted by the winger in Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line while running fine.
But, Livingstone showed the visitors the kind of game they could really enjoy, sweeping the long ball with Lithgow and Lightweight after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have increased their lead, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from stud-up well before Lithgov widened from the corner.
The Rangers called Glenn Middleton as an alternative, claiming another late for the penalty as they got entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't let them succeed again.
Elmanack: Inventor of the Geyser Counter
Now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity Geyser invented a device later known as Geyser Counter.
Geyser is a mainstay of counter-science, it has become the mainstay of pop culture, as well, in 1950 a film on it became "Bells of Coronado," in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acted for the first time:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium."
After turning on these earphones, you can certainly hear the effects of atoms hidden in the minerals due to radioactivity."
Evans: "Tell me, right now it's definitely popping up!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, at the time he was about 63 years old.
But, because of his invention, his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can see the malfunctioning cells of the immune system
The new cancer vaccine can see and eliminate malfunctioning immune system cells
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify malfunctioning cells during treatment
With this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be extracted and replaced
After that, they can see the common protein for many cancers and then remove it and reapply
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in different types of cancer patients.
A woman was given the vaccine, which looked at her weakened cells in the immune system, then found that her ovarian cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
This method can remove and replace a patient's immune cells in the laboratory, so that they can "see" the common proteins found in many cancers called HER2, and then reproduce the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very promising.”
Prof Berzofsky said that HER2 causes "the development of many types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer.
Patients' removal of immune cells and "instruction" them to detect cancerous cells is beneficial in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't work out
After Kanye West's best performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that his government will be formed in 2020, he slammed in the studio during Saturday's Night Live.
Following the performances of his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So, I talk to the Gore people a few times and they say: ‘What’s the reason for you to like Trump, are they racist?’
Yet, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago."
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's Skit, in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already investigating claims of sexual assault made on him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing of the sort was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether Rock was trying to make West's laugh with the posting because of the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that he was threatened to go to the backstage with his headwear.
"They threatened me backstabbing.
"""You don't go there wearing that hat,"" he said."
They threatened me!
"I'm stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: “Do you want to see that wrong place?” Plus, he said, “They’ll make dramas for my Superman Cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do with it. Do you want the world to move on?
Love it."
In his comments, he referred to the audience at least twice and the SNL artists felt embarrassed, a man in a separate report told the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was summoned because of the delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, a few days before Ariana Grande's old boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died.
West surprised many viewers by giving performances on the song I Love It, dressed like Periyar Botol.
West again met with Conservative Group TPUSA chief Candace Turner, who tweeted: “For one of the most courageous people: thank you for raising the voice for the public.”
But, Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted that West is just there "what she told and what is absolutely amazing."
“But, I didn’t choose anyone who was taking advantage (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their “art”) that, in my opinion, was promoting the wrong idea for my community or misrepresenting my community.”
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted on Twitter that he had changed his name, as well, adding that he was just "formally going to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but earlier did the same for Didi and Puffy, whose earlier names were Puff Daddy and P Didi respectively.
Along with him, the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Lion and the late famous Prince of Music also changed his name to a symbol and after that the artist was already known as the Prince.
Attempted Murder by Knife in Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder, suspecting he stabbed a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Bali.
The defence is expected to appear in Belfast's magistrate's court on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington has questioned toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's Violent Middle Fantasy Series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that seeing such a role on screen often inspires many young boys and feels that such a difficult task is necessary to earn respect.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt told that he was feeling "something wrong" and asked how to overcome the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently, Kitt married Game of Thrones' co-star Rose Leslie, 31, who believes she feels "strong enough" to talk about the problem.
"Personally, I feel quite strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about masculinity?"
“Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems they see on screen?”
Kitt feels that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, thanks to its too much male lead character.
He added: "What is it and what is it taught?
From what is taught on TV and on the street, young boys begin to believe that they must do certain things to be a man.
In my opinion, this has really become one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the ideas of young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series will come back at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well, he also said that he has done a number of programs with 'flight grounds and horse riding'.
From November, Kit will be seen in Sam Shepard's new series True West, which tells the story of a film producer whose brother is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones is his meeting with his wife Rose.
“I got my spouse through this show, so I believe that this show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from here,” she said.
Rose plays the role of Yagrit, who is the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character of Kit in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married with family consent in Lesley, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, new cases in China have increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Given the changes that have taken place in the last few years, most of the new cases are attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to an infected blood infection.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to nearly zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex done by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that the LGBT community has a lot of discrimination against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
Due to many infections of the disease, these relationships have inadequate protection against sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, promising every person that they will be given access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that her staff had leaked the GOP senator's data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "how to conspire".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters described Saturday's allegations as unfortunate, saying one of her employees had posted private information of three Republican U.S. Senators on Lomecker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by the pundits and website of the "ultra-right wing."
"Lies, lies, and so much hate,"" Waters tweeted."
The information reportedly included addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information was seen online on Thursday when an unidentified man posted on Capitol Hill was being heard by the Senate panel over allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Questions were being raised about the leak of some information from the three senators.
Hill says the address from a conservative site like Gateway Pundit and RedState that identifies the source of the person posting the IP address was reported to be linked to the Waters office and that the information was issued by a Waters employee.
"This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false," Waters said.
None of my employees — whose identities, personal information, and security are being put at risk because of these false and false allegations — were in any way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This allegation is baseless, totally false and absolutely false.
Waters soon posted online to clear criticism, including the former White House press secretary.
"The reason for this rejection is anger," Fletcher wrote.
"This shows that his temperament is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not be angry and do so.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They should remain calm and be patient. "
It seemed that Fletcher Waters's response was being compared to Judge Kavanaugh's condemnation of the Democrats, with critics accusing Kavanaugh of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate for the midterm election, also tweeted his thoughts on Twitter.
"If that's true, that's a huge thing,"" he tweeted."
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and rules-enforcing units for these claims of fraud.
"We will make sure that the offenders will be informed or not, and that they will be held legally liable for all the acts they have committed which are very bad and dangerous to any and all of my employees," he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's acting as a spy was not considered too powerful
From a British point of view, the importance of Brexit is still traditionally seen in any new film, and it appears to be applicable to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back in 2011 under the name Johnny English Reborn.
Will we self-reflect on the subject of how we certainly consider talking about the nation’s new export opportunity as nonsense?
Johnny English, at any rate pop-oriented and rubber-faced, has his license to re-create stuff with bare feet - something that is more famous than anything else by just his name - is a broader comic creation for areas where non-English-speaking people live.
He is certainly the Daft Secret Agent who managed to show Mr. Bean's Dash Cluso a little bit, despite his bizarre pretense in Smoothy Glamour, and is a Dolphin for the Chap who contributed a single note to the Chariot of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is originally a traveler and is the International Man of Mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclays TV commercials, except for Wake's Chaos, was forgotten.
Only one or two good scenes can be seen in this new JE outing.
I liked Johnny English quite a bit in which the armored medieval suit was shown to go in a helicopter and wrap the rotor blade on his helmet.
Doing physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift to Atkinson, but the laughter came very little and the strange half-full, especially the "Best of the Best" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves with full confidence as a component of comedy.
(Laughter) Comes in such a way that comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's peculiar misconceptions are, in my opinion, not tolerable at all, and I prefer Bean to Atkinson's silent-film.
What is always relevant right now is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
Britain's most secretive network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, the network that kept the identity of all of Britain's working agents to influence the agent's work - a tragic incident for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the fabulous and quite troubled Prime Minister, he is already grappling with many political and unpopular problems: Emma Thompson can play this Quasi-Teresa-Me character well, but the script is not too powerful to work on this script.
Her intelligence advisers told her that every working detective has been compromised, she will have to bring in someone who has retired.
In this way it meant that Johnny English would have to fight himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but an undercover operative has to work away from the record on what it should be: it has some good comedies, as well as, teaching English at a rock-type academy school by detectives.
English has been sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for briefing, and Ben Miller's replay role has been merged with his old-fashioned sidekick buff.
Now that Boff is married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role is of Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky Pepperdine has not recovered.
Therefore, Batman and Robin make some big mistakes in her Majesty's Secret Service when they encounter Ophelia Bulettova, Olga Cruelenko's beautiful femdom torn.
Meanwhile, the prime minister gets jeopardized by the kerosene-technical billionaire who claims he has a solution to Britain's computer crises: the sinner Jason Volta played the role of Jack Lacy.
English and Boggs start their Odyssey of the Farsi High-Jinx: working as waiters, setting fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle through Volta’s expensive boat; and English completely activates chaos when he tries to use Volta’s interior as a virtual reality headset.
The film has definitely been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but still it’s fine and entertaining, there’s a lot of fun stuff for kids throughout the film.
A proper medium-sized.
Also, as I saw in other Johnny English films, in this film I did not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really suits his talent?
Labour has denied that it plans to work only four days a week for the UK, but the money will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a democratic plan in which UK residents will have to work only four days a week - but the money will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's owners to give part of the savings through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, so that they can get an extra day's leave.
This will give the employee a three-day leave per week - but they will still be able to get equal pay.
Sources said such an idea would go "better" with the party's economic agenda and it is planned to benefit the workers in the country.
The trades union Congress is promoting a four-day shift a week to help workers take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party employee from The Sunday Times said: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but it is expected to be a four-day work week, which is in line with the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers.
With the Green Party promising a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, at present, this wish is not being fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesperson said: The four-day work week is not the partys policy and is not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get back power in utility firms from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers'.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full share back as the Labour government can 'deduct' based on alleged misdeeds.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees in the company's boards and hand over 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees who can get annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy Tells “60 Minutes” Whether a Cavanna Check by the FBI Could Change His Mind
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility of the FBI finding something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina ally.
"Of course, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the courtroom and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After that happened, when this allegation came out, I called them, asked, 'Did you do that?'
They were sure, determined, clear."
However, Graham's vote, it seemed, was a stone's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And he could not verify what they had named.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has It Reduced Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert with many highly influential stars to perform, and equally impressive is its mission; to end the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the extreme poverty eradication program by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an extension of the Global Power Project, which hopes to end poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting against it.
In order to receive free tickets for the event (except when you’re not ready to pay a VIP ticket), attendees of the concert must complete “actions” in multiple ways, such as emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways to help create awareness about your goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been over the last 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through free concerts the right way to persuade people to call for action, or is the so-called “clicktivism” just another case – making people feel like they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters while pushing efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion are already distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that the safe fund has had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers, committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" by providing Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national government, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition that would reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on your website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shaun Mendes, Cardi B, Genel Monai are among the few performers to perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furnace and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to block Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern region of Europe, Eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockades, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event organized by a non-profit group, the Consumers Energy Alliance, which calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran by saying they are effectively alike.
Referring to Russia as a "one-goal pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "In the case of Iran and Russia, the economic alternative, more or less, is to take advantage of the fuel and replace it."
The statement is coming that the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, which has made Berlin a "ban" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have great trouble when a large state interferes with our energy supply.
The Senator of Massachusetts said that Elizabeth Warren would "seriously consider" the matter of joining the presidential race in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holloway, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and that includes being a woman in the top position,” she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting the presidential election."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren has been vocal in criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “Of course we need a FBI check before voting.”
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think he should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, eighty-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not contest the election.
Thirty-two percent voted in favour of the election.
The survey showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's campaign, where 38 percent supported a possible participation in the election race and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that are likely to run for president by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old track palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence incident.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told the audience, “I sympathize with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return.”
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They return with a slight change, they come back being harsh, they return wondering if this honor is for what his fellow soldiers and aircraftmen, and every other member of the army, have sacrificed for the country."
A spokeswoman for the Wassila Police Department, Dan Bennett, said he was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence and possession of weapons while drunk.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of the New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a new U.S. policy legal challenge that denies sheltering victims of gang escapes or victims of domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a justice-friendly summary letter in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the Grace vs Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her violent gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which create a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Raisin, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such obstruction violates that principle," said Justice-Friend.
The attorney further argued in the abstract that the policy of refusing immigrants' entry harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to shelter victims of domestic exploitation and mass violence.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, “A shelter is available for those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear of being a member of their caste, religion, nationality or a particular social group.”
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in the search for survivors has doubled.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It seems extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling the child suffering from fever in the exit center of the city of Tahas-Nahas Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
"Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their desolate houses, picking up submerged goods, trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized in the quake of magnitude 7.5.
Some of the injured, including Dwee Harris, who was facing a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated in the open outside due to frequent strong earthquake tremors.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt violent tremors in his fifth-floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was buried in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as told that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threatening" by "propaganda advertisements"
A week after running a four-page ad, China's U.S. ambassador to China, referring to the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to promote.
US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid supplement to Iowa's highest-selling newspaper Des Moines Register on last Wednesday - after China accused him of trying to meddle in the November 6 congressional elections - an allegation that China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them impose customs duties on each other’s imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China's first retaliatory customs duty in the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and long-time former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press," Branstad wrote, expressing his opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register.
"In its propaganda, by giving paid ads in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of freedom of speech and independent journalism," Branstad wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in a strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, on the contrary, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any correct reflection of the inconsistent opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic curve," he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided putting forth excuses for proposing to publish his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are isolating women voters ahead of mid-term elections with Cavanaugh's defeat, analysts warn
As top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment, the analyst has warned that they will see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming medieval elections.
Emotions around it are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things can't be brought back," Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rehr said he suspects that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for a FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - nor can they forget it tomorrow or November," said Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor to the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to a Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to proceed with Cavana's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters in the Senate hall shouted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to get off the charts,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already rampant; it's true.
But this could be more, especially among female voters from the suburbs and 18- to 29-year-old young voters who don’t often vote when the president doesn’t like it.”
In a detailed account of Ford's allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had already said that there is a possibility of opposition if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
"This has become a confusing mess for the GOP," said former Republican National Committee president Michael Steele, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or putting Cavana on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they've treated them," Guy Cecil, director of the Republicans' Association of Privileges USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe in in the wake of the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, most of whom seem to favor Cavana.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony to be definitive or potentially reliable, while 35 percent said they believed Cavanaugh to be definitive or potentially reliable.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Cavana might or might not have lied during her testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as, at least one other Faraday, Deborah Ramírez, the Guardian reported.
Ford took the oath last week and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavana assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee displayed her genitals when she joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet versus Google and Facebook
World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to gain "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and business tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it depends entirely on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-site developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were "not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change, where all of their business models will be completely eliminated overnight."
"We're not asking for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Von: Celebrated the WW1 Victoria Cross Clarik
The only pastor of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the September 29, 1918 attack on Bellingelage and Lehcourt.
However, they were killed by a sniper four days later and never knew they had won the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his ships at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vaughan, said it was "gloriously symbolic" that this pattern was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion in the Canal de Saint-Quentin "amid a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns in the battlefield."
They later headed towards the firing line and, with "big bravery," led the military-line before taking the field-gun alone and demolished three divisions.
On October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan was killed by a German sniper, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather’s accomplishments were “some that I know can never be equated with, but which we are offended by.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also performed after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "very honoured to play a role in the parade" and said "the support being given by many is demonstrating the heroism of a real hero."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they found Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the belligerent 206, but were deprived of watching the main program.
San Jose's bill had 13 contests, including six on the main card and was being shown live all night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Moussassi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, spectators in the UK were stunned by the coverage's shift to Peppa Pig.
There were a lot of disappointments, especially after waking up in the morning for the competition.
A fan on Twitter described the switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, said, “This material was not suitable for 6 a.m. as per government regulation, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"""Pappa the pig, yeah."
Scott Koker, president of Bellator Company, said they are going to work on their schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
“I think when I think of Ripley, I think we’ll probably find a solution,” Coker said.
"But then it will be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, their time on Monday."
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change took place, there was a lot of text movement and not all of them were favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We'll limit it to five contests instead of six -- as we usually do -- and when we tried to deliver something more to the fans, it just happened a little bit more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disk: Tom Daly Feels ‘Happiness’ in Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he fell victim to a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality - but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daily said she didn’t realize until she reached secondary school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she talks about gay rights to “hope” others.
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics when he became a father.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to illness.
On appearing as a social-destroyer in Lavern’s first program, Daly said she was feeling “less” in herself than everyone else because “loving boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
She said: “Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also “good,” she said, so that he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live freely without any hassle and wanted to “hope” others.
The three-time world champion said that a male – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “I was surprised when he fell in love.”
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone who had experienced similar ups and downs at such a young age.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said his "whole point of view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are a lot more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
The Daily said his father did not admit that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was if he had London 2012 tickets - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, "I couldn't tell him that you wouldn't be sitting in the front row, Dad."
She said, "I held their hands when they were unable to breathe and held them until they stopped breathing and they were dead, so I went and thought they were not invincible."
The following year, Deli competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that's what I've dreamed of all my life - there was no better feeling than diving in front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games," she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - Proud by Heather Small - that had been resonating with him during the preparations for the Olympics and that still makes his rogues stand out.
The Desert Island Disk will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson ruled out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when they play their 47th Ryder Cup match, but they have to change their form to save it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for the 12th time on record, Mickelson was ruled out of the game by captain Jim Furyck for Saturday's Foreballs and Forbes.
Instead of becoming the center of attraction, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day living among cheerleaders and working in the hopes of improving the weaknesses of his way of playing.
The 48-year-old, who never drives straight even at the peak of his career, has never been an ideal fit for the tight-leaf golf national course, where those who haven't been active for a long time are regularly punished for wrong shots.
And while the course isn't that easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played together with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American starters, with four points down in 12 singles matches, make a strong start, then Mickelson's match can prove to be very important.
Fury exuded confidence in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, patted my back and surrounded me in their arms and said they'd be ready tomorrow," Furyck said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but it worked the way we did and the way we thought we would have to move on.
He wants to go out there like everybody else."
Mikelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mikelson has won 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, though Furik said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas Byrne knows that the big lead may soon disappear
Thomas Byrne, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large lead in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dan made his first appearance in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where a side led by Sev Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win, with the lowest margin, simply reached the finishing line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, we just managed to win," Björn said after seeing a 10-6 lead in the 2018 class Friday 5-3 and tomorrow at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the people on that team that it’s not over.
You'll pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy and that's where the focus is to stay.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players around the world - stand on the other side."
Björn went on to explain how his players performed on the tough golf course: “In this I will never be able to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Personal performances will come up tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It’s great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you get out there in person, your potential as a golfer is fully tested.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players to showcase your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he also has to give his best."
Unlike Björn, the opposite-standing Jim Furyck would have been wishing for a better performance for his players personally than he did as a partner, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Before facing defeat due to Europe's "miracle in Medina", being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furik himself has been on both ends of those big last days reflections.
"I remember every word of him," he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this speed is unilateral, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set our line-up to our own and included people as we felt, you know, we’re trying to do something more miraculous tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with leading the counter-attack with Rory McLaro in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other top half of the European order.
"I had them grouped in this order because I think it covers all," Björn said of his single selections.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again.
The new warships of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the period-affected Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and fast-growing costs, at least not until next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rainland-Puffle", the flagship ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class warships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the issues that bothered after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered back by the Navy in 2007 to be brought in as a replacement for time-affected Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will feature an array of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, continued delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - which would allow Germany to have a power project abroad - would be timeless until the period of entry into service, Die Zin commented.
The Durdent F125 warship made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the ship's maker after delivery.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited several important "software and hardware faults" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on war missions.
The drawbacks of the software were particularly significant because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Renland-Puffle" is believed to be twice as heavier than the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have risen from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new warships that have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings is gripping Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was actually "finishing ship-capable ships."
The official said the issue has become serious over time as the old ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were made available.
He said none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is hiding the secret life of bats.
New research being done in an estate in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how bats use natural landscapes in their prey for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique mammals flying and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland, will follow the general and soprano pipestriles as well as brown-eyed and dobenton bats in the Inverve Gardens of Weston Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at major locations around the property to track the movement of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings reveals the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
Then a map and report of the natural habitat will be prepared for illustration on a detailed scenario-scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural habitat management tasks such as building grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the U.K. has declined significantly in the last century
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect bird bases and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also be dangerous.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to point out defects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly survey, inspect bird bases and sometimes save them.
The organization has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the three estates of Dumfries in Scotland and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Real Estate Manager David Thompson says the property is the best place for him.
"We have a great area for bats here in Three," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there’s so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other estates will help us understand what they need to grow.”
They underscore the importance of checking bats before they are kept inside the estates because it is possible that inadvertently 400 females and infants could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternal-birth base, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, satanize or harass them or destroy their bases.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward for help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we still don’t know how their populations are growing.”
Ronaldo denies rape claims while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape claims against him "fake news" and said people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Dere Spiegel reported on Friday that she allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in Instagram live video after reporting claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
"What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to propagate themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular by taking my name, but that’s part of their job.
I'm a happy person and all is well," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges he has called "suspicious invalid reporting in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the players "will seek compensation for moral damages in an amount consistent with the severity of the violation, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good person" whose "one per cent" had been disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and even photographed her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement as she felt "neglected by vengeance" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to end the deal as her harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Italian giant Juve this summer.
Brexit: U.K. 'will forever regret losing carmaker'
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K. would "forever regret" if it lost its title as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Bernstone near Derby if Britain left the European Union.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said border delays could have an impact on jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Burnstone plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“I believe that if the UK exits the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Burnstone.
Other UK carmakers have expressed apprehensions about leaving the EU without consent on how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will operate.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to carmakers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts for made-to-order cars coming from suppliers in both the UK and the European Union every 37 minutes.
If the U.K. leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption on the border, according to the industry, which could lead to delays and a shortage of spares.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said Theresa May’s checkers plan for future relations with the EU “clearly calibrated to avoid those checks on the border.”
“We need a deal. We want a great deal that, in my opinion, can not only enjoy success in the present, but also what is needed to achieve this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only Toyota but there’s evidence from other manufacturers that we should be able to continue to do it fully which has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to jobs gone.
Peter Sauvaillaris, who has worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is United's convener at the plant, said his members are highly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back after bad.
An official spokesman said: “We have advanced an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House said on Sunday that a high stakes meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "another week later" as the struggle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, relations between the Trump assistant and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The news that Trump will oust the Deputy Attorney General and endanger Mueller's freedom has warmed Washington's rumours market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of putting a wire to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refuted the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not "like" removing Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avert a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Cavanaugh's claims, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date for this has not been set, it may be this week, I can see that the eye on all other cases going on with the Supreme Court could be pushed forward another week."
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not due to the TV reporters' dislike of the "potentiality," though he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they're gorgeous."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The President conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other president," she said, citing no evidence: "We have seen those numbers."
The briefing will still be, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me."
We try very hard to do this and you have seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he is going to take the place of the press talks."
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at press conferences with dignitaries.
A single press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated in front of the reporters a unique and sometimes unparalleled presence, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS, expressing their gratitude to the country and wishing them to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its degraded public services.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, moving towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also taking its preparations forward for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to now reiterate how much I value their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee Mike Organ said Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just a short time before Hofftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on the stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official in the state of Tennessee told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "no details are available on the type/limitation of the injury yet" and that the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, which is Redshirt Sophomore, is in its first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, he made a total of five tackles on Saturday, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers while buying property in the UK
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged high stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme.
The move will neutralize Corbyn's campaign's success to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Preparations are underway to recover the high stamp duty rate on buying property in the UK from foreign buyers - the extra cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, which attracts young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting higher earners.
The stamp duty hike will be imposed on non-tax payers and firms in the U.K., with additional funds to boost the government's campaign to tackle gold miners under odd circumstances.
Overload - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two houses launched two years ago and rental purchases, can be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly-built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, leading to a rise in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to step foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's wealthy regions - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut with the intention of helping more young people build their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of grabbing land but not using it to raise property prices, and urged Ms. Johnson to drop quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "women's recklessness."
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including fare controls and the end of "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more authority to the councils for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our fragmented housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build lives.
However, it’s not perfect that it’s as easy for non-residents in the UK as for foreign-based companies to buy a home for hardworking British residents.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become a distant thing, and the fury of sleeping under odd circumstances is extremely real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "last ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some stage.
Scott, 42, is reiterating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in the league one, and which is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's just what it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsround.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father since childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in club management."
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Goose Poet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Eloa Athletic Boss says he felt no hesitation in following established names in a big club that had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's initiative.
"At the moment the success for me can be gauged from whether I can return this club to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself succeeding here if I can get the club there."
After 15 months as Dumbarton’s assistant boss and Harts coaching staff, Ross’s management career has only lasted three years.
He then helped Eloa recover from the degradation of the third tier, and turned St. Mirren from the edge of the degradation of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable now than they did during their careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably the real crossroads," he said in the matter of taking over Aloua.
"I really believed that management was a better fit for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I did the right thing, earned the right amount from it, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But it can be difficult to play.
You get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but in terms of management everything seems fine.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life."

The correct time for a pint is at 5.30 pm on Saturday, the survey found
The heat of summer has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
The Pub and Bar group saw sales grow by 2.7 percent in July - but the restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: "The July comparison to the continued sunshine and England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that similar patterns were followed in the month of June last year, when pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that the restaurant faced even more difficulties."
Restaurant trade declined by 1.8 per cent in June and further deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars selling wine performed the strongest with more likes than restaurants.
Food-driven pubs also suffered sun damage, although not dramatically like restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
For the month, the sales of all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent, while food was down by three per cent.
Paul Newman, Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM said: “These results have continued the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events make up the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, though a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales, especially due to ongoing cost pressures, would be painful.
The long summer season could not have been a worse time for food operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed relief.”
Pubs and restaurants, including new ones, saw a 2.7 per cent increase in total sales in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collecting and analyzing data from 47 operating groups performing with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
The survey shows that one in five children - some of them under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are younger than 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a sharp increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clear “main” account to show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found that a teenager in her was urging others to “rape me.”
Research from independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice for athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most decorated track and field athletes and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who have guided the sport to benefit from their extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
"Elidh has great respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that bringing them to the board in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide for the sport in Scotland.”
In addition to their four Olympic gold medals, Americans who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and now who are regular BBC pundits became unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a shock today.
I cant walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will get well and to what extent.
It was a terrific job, but learned to fully recover, walk again and practice agility today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Comparison of mothers' cows by breast pump advertising created differences in people's opinions online
A breast pump company split opinion online by an advertisement that compares lactating mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "The World's First Silent Wearable Breast Bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new fun music video-inspired ad, with the new pump giving moms the freedom to express themselves.
In the grassy barn of cows, four real mothers dance to a song that includes some words like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no queues" and "If you haven't noticed, these are not the ants, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Dem Babys, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies.”
Whatever the case, the advertisement, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from the audience, with many saying it lightly portrays the "horrific" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
They need to give birth as soon as we do, to get pregnant and produce milk, except that their babies are stolen within a few days after they are born," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits spontaneously inside the nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another remark: "Obviously painful for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to have their babies?"
Someone else added: "What an irrelevant ad."
Others defended the ad, of which one woman said she found the ad to be "comic."
"I think this is a very good idea.
I would have done it if I was still breastfeeding.
I have the experience of being a cow by pumping.
This ad is a little strange, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote: "It's a great product."
The second commented: “It’s a fun ad for moms who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like a “cow.”
It is not a promotional or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they continued to dance by carefully pumping in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvi pump remains well hidden, has no wires or tubes and fits directly into a nursing bra with caution, giving women the freedom to walk around without pumping, catching their babies, and even going out.
Anna Ballerine, partner and ECD in Mother commented: "Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, entitled to a banging and brilliant launch.
By outlining the parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, demonstrating a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way, which will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvi pump has been in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product appeared to be catwalking for designer Marta Jacuzzi.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The captured migrant children were spied on, even when there was no relative change in the monthly border crossings, to a lesser extent because of the rigorous curvature and policies offered by the Trump administration making it difficult to employ children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves had employed migrants without document and were afraid to go ahead and risk their own ability to live in the country by claiming any child.
The threat escalated further in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adult or large members of the home would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigrant authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official for immigration and customs enforcement, presented evidence before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unidentified minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested already had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
Seeking to quickly prepare the children, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children were required to appear in court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the employees who took shelter.
Many people appear through video conference calls instead of appearing in person to present their case for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are deemed to be ineligible for release are dismissed immediately.
The longer the children remain captives, the more likely they are to be baychan or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts, according to conservation staff and the system's report in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a higher facility like Tornillo, where the sign that the child is struggling is ignored because of their size.
At the same time, he added that taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to get emotionally ready or saying goodbye to friends would add to the shock that he is already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., Turkish and French forces to immediately withdraw
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the country was now in its eighth year of war.
Moulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces live illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly."
"They should immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the battlefield," he told the assembly.
Mawlam stressed that the "war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of people have been rooted out of their homes.
"Damascus will continue to fight this "supernatural war" until we clear all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and "the presence of a foreigner," he said.
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on land in the country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Maulam said the conditions were fine for his return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of worthlessness," which prompted the refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this withdrawal,” he said.
"They were politicizing a completely humane matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no aid to rebuild Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the stronghold of Idlib's last major insurgency creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political negotiations, says United States politicians.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement averted a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where three million people lived.
Moulam, however, said the agreement contained "clear deadlines" and hoped that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra Front, who would be "removed."
United States Representative Stafan Di Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to prepare for a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the election path soon.
Moulam placed certain conditions in the committee for the Syrian government's participation, which said the panel's work should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and to warn against interference.
Why Trump will win in the second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are hoping for any impeachment and scandal to end his term ahead of time.
Undoubtedly "This will be by far the most dramatic end of the national post!"
Till now, there was no fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, and MSNBC's "Real Maddo Show" ranked the highest by gaining 3.5 million viewers in the cable ratings with major news airing at night.

Absolutely, stories coming out of Washington, on TV and beyond, can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, one of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only the privileged viewers could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it’s beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself watching a six-hour debate of a panel of experts, Woodward uses the root cause of the “deep background” for his book “Fire,” a description of Paul Manafort’s vested $15,000 bomber jacket (“a thick cloth with hubris” said by the Washington Post) and Stormy K. Sreeney by Daniel.
I'll never see Super Mario that way again.

In the run-up to the election house, there was a flood of external money in the strong middle
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, credited to the re-building of the Congressional chamber, which led to two office-bearers running for the same seat.
That recently opened the front for the Democratic Rap Conner Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won their seat in another district in the special election last spring.
Lamp was also involved in a second term race, Republican Cath Rothfuss, which currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, intersecting with the new 17th.
Maps or maps were rebuilt following the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's January ruling in the case of the old districts being unconstitutionally forged in favor of Republicans.
The empty-handed battle between major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) in the new 17th race touched the campaign's economy.
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory widely seen in the March special election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
For this reason, the seat was occupied by the Republicans for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits instigated the democrats a little more.
US punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrawing
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing as having resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a zealous meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokesman Haider Nort said in a statement that the State Department officials had decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan."
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development, and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials adjourned a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow that aggregation or mass gathering similar to last year, which was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end up considering any penalties or fines for El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in a gesture of importing administrative spaces.
And the three Americans returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic quietly without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians who agree to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
His accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration as well as speaking on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case could be the Special Council Robert Mueller report on Mr. Trump’s potential resistance to justice, of which there is now enough evidence in the public record.
At the same time, Mr Mueller reports changing the direction of his investigation if Mr Trump’s campaign conspires with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in the body when he prepares himself to face the voters again and perhaps a jury of his colleagues.
That is, a lot if or if and I do not mean to imply or suggest that neither Mr. Trump nor his counterparts in Europe are inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed by the West and supported by Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop so many years of genocide.
The functioning of the historical centre points around such divisive points and the inalienable march of democracy are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what would we do?
Rosentin has been in the limelight ever since this paper reported it last year, suggesting secretly keeping the president's record and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosentin said The Times account is not accurate.
"If the F.B.I. investigation of the recently requested Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial - or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court despite the authentic allegations of sexual exploitation and false testimony, how will we respond?"
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail those investigations, democracy will last for a long winter.
But I think because of the lessons I learned in Preg, we will not fail.

Graham Dornan's Rangers Are Still Optimistic After Intense Vienna Encounter
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, winning the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Dowden from appearing for the first time in the season with Villareal to a 2-2 tie, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villarreal was good," the 31-year-old said.
"We went ahead in the game with the belief that we can achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will likely be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving towards Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got good results with the crowd or crowd behind us in their previous game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes I made in the club itself last year was certainly difficult but now there is a good experience in this space.
The squad is good and the guys are really enjoying it; they’ve got good training.
Hopefully, we can now leave our previous session behind and move forward and succeed.”
Women are losing their sleep because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking to their family members about it.
More than half of people across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here’s where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare to take care of your family if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Talk to your advisor and your family about where and how to get care, as those options can be key factors in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor may also suggest you on ways to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have money.
Present your legal documents: simplify your legal battle.
Get a health-care proxy, so you hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate or interact.
Also, consider the attorney's authority to inspect your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions related to their medications and allergies?
Put that information in a written plan, so that you are ready.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise further, officials said.
When the communication was closed, the rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongla region, the northern area of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island on a narrow bay.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donghala is a region on the coast to the northwest of Sulawesi Island, spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The Regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, up from 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of the central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Moroville on the coasts unlike the maximum Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has struck Palu and Donghala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the Tsunami in Donghala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit West Donghala, killing nine people.
Indonesia seismically sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers earthquake hits.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake hit 14 countries on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in northern Sumatra on December 26, killing 226,000 people on the coastal line of the Indian Ocean, half of them in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A tsunami of magnitude 6.8 hits Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that exploded off the coast of the south and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang hit the region, which is the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the area on the island of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people in a tsunami that hit an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A shallow water earthquake strikes Pidi Jaya Regency in AK, causing destruction and stampede as people remembered the devastation or devastation of the 2004 terrible earthquake and tsunami.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed when buildings or buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes devastated everything on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern direction of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and rendered thousands of tourists helpless for some time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trek Pellin, the eldest son of East Alaska ruler and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with reports of domestic violence and protesting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she used to take the phone from him.
According to the KTUU report, Pellin was sent back to the Moot-Su Pratrial facility and was also fined $500 in unsecured bonds.
The network reported that he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for the plea.
Palin faced three A class criminals, where he could be fined up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a one-day prison sentence and a class B offence with a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
At present the matter is before the Court of experienced persons of Alaska.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possessing a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016, after her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD stumping in Iraq.
Earthquake tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake activated the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
With the death rate rising in the coming days, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The video was circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people had gathered in the city of Palu for the Beach Festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspect of the NYC attack
Federal prosecutors in New York have been demanding a rare death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment given in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a home depot rental truck allegedly to attack pedestrians and cyclists on the way down the western direction highway in Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, according to the information of the intent to demand the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Cypov has "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" physically injured them."
These two countries impose the death penalty potentially in accordance with the court document.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury struck Saipov with a whip for 22 charges, including eight charges of murder to aid in racketeering, which are specifically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "adequate planning and prior deliberations", explaining the manner in which Cypov carried out it in a "hateful, cruel and evil" manner.
“Saifou Haibibulavic Cypov injured and harmed friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves Endor DeKat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allerge, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alozandro Pagunco,” the intention is expressed in the information.
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The trial of the last death penalty case in New York's South District has been going on for a decade.
Khalid Brain was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was awarded in the New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, a married couple who was found guilty of plotting to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Joann Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Cypov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, did not have any glee or regrets for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he liked what he did.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired to attack after seeing ISIS videos of the crime he met on his phone.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
She pleaded not guilty to herself for the offence of 22-counting.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released would only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include all," Patton said.
Cypov's defense team had earlier asked the defendants not to seek the death penalty.
Tori MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to "unite an army of people" during the protest at the Tori conference.
The Eastern Ukip leader asked politicians to 'understand the mahaul' - because one of May's own MPs suggested he should negotiate with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bonn told March in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage were Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'out by now'.
But the challenges faced by Mrs May in resolving her extremely divided ranks have been underlined by Pro-Remain Tory to add a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Premier is struggling to keep his checkered agreement plan on track during attacks from Brexiteers, Riemanners and the European Union.
The allies urged that she would try to make a deal with Brussels instead of backlash – and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr Bonn said leaving meant leaving the rally in Solihull, in which he wanted to 'feel the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be made a partner and he should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by now," she said.
Wellingboro's MP or MP said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.'
Setting its opposition in the European Union, he said: 'We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bonn rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their views and they want to stay is totally false.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkin also stated this in March: 'I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent among our party and our workers who actually surround the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please skip the checkers and start listening.’
In a focused message to Smt. In, she said: The Prime Minister maintains his jobs when he does not break his promise.
Mr. Faraz said that the leaders of the rally should be made 'realizing the mahaul' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 Referendum.
"This is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes," he said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit and today we’re here to tell them that ‘we won’t let you escape by doing this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit by understanding the environment.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and which does not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers march from Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists pointed to Tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
At the opening of the Labour Peer Lord Adonis conference, the party pretends to have conversations about security issues from the app.
"It's the people who tell us that they can have a fair IT system for Canada, a non-resistance border and a borderless free trade in Ireland and all the technology."
"It's a complete swamp.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to adopt a "strict approach" to the president's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "strictly monitor the operation of the president" after the election in November.
Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrats or Democrats spoke about their future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
A regular critic of President Donald Trump, Warren GOP is in the race for re-election in the state-sponsored Geoff DeHale November, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were speculating that they might take Trump's place in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holloway was his 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked if he was going to join the presidential race.
Warren replied that now is the time for “women to go and fix our broken-hearted government and include women first.”
The death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, seeking help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old was shot dead near a South University campus on Friday morning.
"Police chief Murphy G Paul told 247 Sport on Saturday that he "had been shot in the head by Wade Sims."
Wade stepped forward to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
When Simpson was asked, he admitted to killing Wade Sim with a weapon there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained by the police department of Eastern Baton Rouge Parish.
A 6 by 6-foot junior, who grew up in Baton disease, played 32 games with 10 starters in the previous season at Sims and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ends world title after team's victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that the Valtteri Bottas Lewis Hamilton Mercedes on Saturday" team deserved to play a big role in the order race.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and knocked out Hamilton as he made his place in the first two turn and invited Vatel to create obstacles in the drivers of his team.
Vettel first went to Pitts and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that must be decisive.
Mercedes was a lap back and came out from behind the wattle but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari's driver reluctantly leave without any risk after a double-move while defending on the third corner.
Max Versteppen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
Then he moved on to a larger part of the race as it focused on changing its tyre and quickly surpassed Kimi Rakonen in fourth place.
He finally came to Pitts on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, when Rekonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri did a great job all weekend and is a really great gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly by getting one-two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad mood.
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Saturday made a false allegation to Senator Dean Feinstein that he did not leak a letter to Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented on the current state of the Senate, saying that people were "meaningful and bad and dishonest."
"There's a very good thing or thing that could happen in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at the release and the leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document – “Oh, oh, what?”
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he said, pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July a letter detailing the charges levelled against Kavanaugh by Ford and leaked in early September - but Feinstein refused to admit that it had been leaked from office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee, reports Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he said."
But the president did not find his rejection justified, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "Let me tell you that it was really a very bad gesture.
He may not have done that, but I have hardly ever seen such a bad gesture before."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, the three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct, the President pointed out that Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to take back power by any necessary means.
You see their meanness, their filth, as well as the fact that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to get power or power or control," the mediator reported.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Daver scored two goals for the Giant against Dundee.
Dundee Stars won a 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday to compensate for Friday's loss to the Elite League against the Belfast Giant.
The Giant got a lead of two goals initially through the attacks from Patrick Doyer and Francis Beauwillier.
Before the Giant's lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowne Dyer brought home the side level before reinstalling.
Francois Boshardt equalised it for Dundee before securing a two-goal win by Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen.
It was Adam Keefe's third elite defeat of the season for the man who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giants winning the last three games, this was the fourth meeting of the season on the sidelines.
Dwyer's opening candle came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of McFall, with David Rutherford assisting Beauviller to double the lead in the subsequent four minutes.
In the busy early period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before Matt Mercury's equal to Cowney at 15:16.
Doyer ensures that the Giants take the lead in the first pause until he scores his second goal at the end of the first period.
The domestic side is regrouped and Boshard brings them back to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and ensured his team's fifth win in the final period.
The Giants, who had lost their last five matches so far, are now set to play in their homeland Milton Keyn in their next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed in order to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero or hero since he was killed to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could land safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more missing after the major earthquake struck Friday, activating a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi.
The subsequent traumas in the area continued to devastate and many people were trapped under the debris in the city of Palu.
But while his associates were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunwan Agung refused to leave his busy-controlled post at the Mutiara Cis al-Jufiri airport in Palu.
He remained on duty there to ensure that Betic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died at the hospital.
The decision could have saved hundreds of lives, said a spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Ceretret, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikappan in Kalimton to transport them from another city to a bigger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached Palu.
"He broke our hearts," she said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands with the country's destruction, with the minimisation agency saying access to Donghala, Sigi and Botonsh is limited.
"The death rate may still rise as many bodies may still be buried in relics or debris, or in places that cannot be reached," said Sutopo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six metres demolished Palu, which led to mass cremation on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance would bring dead bodies.
It is very rare to have clean water.
Everywhere, small markets were looted."
Jain Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running the race to help biologists, but we don't know what they'll get there."
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation."
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
The first earthquake in Indonesia occurred earlier this year in Lombok, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports that a man has been missing since the Lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operates the crashed plane in the Pacific Lagoon in Macedonia, now says a man is missing after it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niyugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to a request for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Lakshya Island airport, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which the incident took place is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the two aircraft did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jane said the plane had come down a lot.
"It's a very good thing," Jane said.
Jane said she and others were evacuated from the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the aircraft's personnel were panicked and screaming and he sustained a minor head injury.
The US Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the ferry also helped rescue using an airborne boat to bring people to shore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of the PNG-registered airline in the last two decades but none were involved in the Air Niujini.
The analyst said the time of the night when the woman was burnt alive
The prosecution restored its case on Saturday to re-prosecute a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett's department presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she used cellphone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cellphones, which showed that she was with Talis Chambers on the evening of her death, refuting her previous claims, The Clarion-Lager reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cellphone was near Chambers at the time, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and gave evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tallis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lies because his truck was in Nashville.”
The second inconsistency was that Talis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cellphone records show that they have known each other for a week.
Rollett said that shortly after Chamber's death, Tallis removed all text or messages, calls or contact information from his phone.
"She wiped him out of her life," Hale said.
Defendants are set to begin their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expected to go to the jury for a hearing on the case that day.
High Breed: What is Conscious or Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by filling in positive messages in their music.
High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has strayed from its core to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and re-aware of the popular hip-hop.
Artists such as Fugees and Common saw a latest revival in Britain through artists such as Alaka and Loki.
The second black person?!
NY Nanny Sues Couple After Firing After "Racist" Text
A New York Nanny sues a couple for biased shooting after a mother complains that she is a "second black person" after making misleading texts.
Couples reject that they are resistant, prosecuting for "attraction."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, on finding out that Giselle, the new baby caregiver, expresses her gratitude to Maurice, who was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman said to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, it sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home in Uber after paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands a $350 per day compensation on the couple's job and for six months, he was however hired to start work without a contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do such a thing," he said in a post on Friday.
The couple said on claims that they were racist, stating that they could not trust him after insulting him, it was appropriate to end Morris' employment.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He is not racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joe Plasco told the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you’ve ever insulted, even if it’s a mistake?
Your new baby?
Let it go."
Like the "attraction" lawsuit, Plasco said his wife had only two months to give birth and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're following someone like that?"
It is not right to do so," said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, they have responded swiftly to the accusations on the couple on social media, silenceing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers fear that the reader will not link it to their own views and opinions, new letter suggests
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkle, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of someone putting their own place on reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's amazing to know about Pendington's success."
Explaining about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, he was optimistic about the rejection of his work, saying that there were both "happiness and gum" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, about which she describes as a "significant member of her family," she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not arrogant at all," she said.
"But because Pendington was so real to them, it was almost as if you had a kid who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not really doing it."
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
"Although it was his imagination and creation, he always credited Paddington for it."""
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors went in vain.
"Nad was saying regularly that it was really bad, not expecting such a thing from her," said Mrs. Edna-Laparos.
"Then Ned called me and told me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave to beat her heart was gradually ending leaving her system.
He would have died some time ago and it would have stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was going to end.
I couldn’t do anything to scream, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by people in my family.
I had to take care of everyone."
Finally Mrs. Aden-Laparos who was sad to lose her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I put my head down and I was crying all the time.
It was difficult to express, but I found the feeling of utmost empathy for Ned in the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of victims to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones due to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hunfrie post cards and phone numbers on the bridge to the Welsh with inspirational messages on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always used to say that his smile could light up everywhere."
However he had left work before he died and he lived in a “very dark room.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother who discovered his lost brother or sister at the age of 11 at the time, after which he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect.”
Ms Davis made the card, “To let people know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if it’s not a friend.”
Don't sit quietly - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we will make some changes to his behavior.
He was so sad on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he couldn't see them."
She said her death was a big shock for her, but she had to get out of it: "It tore the family apart from the inside."
It made us sad.
But we all had to move forward."

Kavanaugh's future was in jeopardy when the FBI began its investigation
"I thought, if I could really find something that he's looking for - a limited time and limited scope of scrutiny - maybe we could bring a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, as well as fearing that the committee is "breaking up" between the alleged partisan gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want a FBI investigation?
It was because of his timelessness.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 – as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so they will seriously weaken their efforts in what they wanted to win in the High Court on the ground.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Senator, campaigns to support Mr. Kuwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate will have 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kuwangua could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, Vice President, had to do by abolishing it and ratifying it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'destroyed' by Kim Jong-un
North Korea's number of fugitives who went to South Korea fell seven years ago when John-Unn came to power, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the Ministry of Integration of the South, Park Beyoncé-Syong said 1,127 people fled their duties last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and crooks were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
A large number of fugitives from the North are eventually proposed to be South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easy to cross the Reliably Protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their home countries by forcing them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically in a state of war - have seen improvements in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on blocked denuclearization talks.
It was activated in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to the terms of working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we would first have no way but to harm ourselves unilaterally," Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "fun", saying he's not qualified for the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "fun" and said he was "unfit" by nature to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of a Mahila that could even do such a demonstration, they call it "fun," Pelosi said Thursday, reacting to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes yelling and breathing while talking about his family and his school years.
He apparently blamed the Democrats on the committee, falsifying the allegations of "extraordinary and coordinated character secrecy" by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said he felt Kavanaugh's witnesses had proved he could not work in the Supreme Court as it showed he was pro-democracy.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi expressed doubts that if Kavanaugh becomes permanent and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, will he still blame Kavanaugh.
"I would say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fair to the Supreme Court, but being invited can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanguya is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible rules in Kavangua against the Act or Roe v. Wade's affordable care, as she is known to do conservative justice.
In the suo motu of his certification, Kavangua deferred questions about whether he would reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh deferred questions on whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
And women need to shake it up.
It's a religious conundrum, the anger of months and years goes out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stemin told me 45 years later that “we get angry when we cry.”
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
"A woman who helped me a lot who works as an officer, who said that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you feel like I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the earliest jobs, one of my sharpest memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, found an old woman holding my neck from behind – a sharp manager from whom I always felt a little intimidated – who dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't cry in front of anyone," he said.
"They don't know how strong you are.
They think you’re sad and you’ll be happy to meet them.”
Patricia Schröder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called Monkey Business or marrying someone else and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schröder, who was highly disappointed, decided to run for President himself.
"It wasn't a thought-provoking decision," she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was delayed, she did not have time to collect funds and so she swore that she would not participate in the race until she collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I've got any discounts?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she couldn't control the emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and even frustration and anger at sexism from targeted voters rather than representatives - she suffocated.
"You must have thought I'd have a nerve break down," Ms. Schroder recalled how the press would have reacted to her.
"You must have thought that Clenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they put on my grave.
"She was crying?"""
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the trade war between the US and China was slowing down and while the war is still far from over, the rift between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by imposing major Chinese export taxes, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week with new tariffs affecting items up to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated every time in its own way, with the most recent slapping tariffs ranging from five to 10 percent of the $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to blink soon.
Getting back to Washington means hollowing out demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that while Beijing can move on, the U.S. trade war can positively support China over the long term, while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that either trigger economic tailspins in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than previously seen by the audience," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center for New America Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria said it was ready for a voluntary return of refugees and was appealing for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moulam said that the situation is improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and safe due to the progress made against terrorism today," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maulam said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup 2018 after beating the US team by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jorn's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American, Europe regains its title again.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water on the 3rd hole across 16th, accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds by becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the European team's lowest-ranked player Thorbjohn Olsen of Denmark by 5 and 4.
World's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson lost 2 and 1 to Lane Polter of England, who probably played his last Rider Cup.
A veteran of the Eight Rider Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It has been a difficult year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm very happy that I was able to help," Gracia said emotionally after Europe's victory.
She torched her partner John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles play on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching them," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time has only won 14 major titles in second place after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finneau, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee of America and move forward with Thosem.
I love these 12 guys so much and I am proud to be their captain.
You should congratulate them.
We played better."
