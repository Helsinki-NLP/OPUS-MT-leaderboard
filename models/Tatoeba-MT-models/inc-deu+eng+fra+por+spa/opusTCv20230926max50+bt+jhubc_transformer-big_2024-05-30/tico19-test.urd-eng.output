The total spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased sharply from January 1 to March 15, 2020
Similar trends are being expressed in the overall spread of coronavirus cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (COVID-19), while the global pandemic of COVID-19 in all countries is accelerating at different stages on a country-by-country basis.
Based on Italy's experience, many countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness thanks to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they will need care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei province.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent is the novel coronavirus, now known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> In 14% of cases, COVID-19 occurs in the case of a more serious illness, requiring hospitalization, while in 66% of cases, those with severe illness need extreme care.
The mortality rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we will assess the trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/Europa (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare them with China's Hubei province.
We also compare the recent number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy during January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and the EU
After China, there was a further geographic spread of COVID-19, and the dynamic state of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently in line with that country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the Euro Surveillance issue of March 5, 2020, Speratry at All reported the first European-confirmed COVID-19 cases as per the WHO's case definition.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA, reported on 24 January 2020 by three French men returning from Wuhan, Hubei province of China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported COVID-19 cases, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of 31 December 2019 today, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths occurred in Italy alone.
Achieving aggregate data and aggregate spread of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) receives data on COVID-19 cases in every country around the world only from government sources, national and regional health authorities, and the World Health Organization's daily update at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with Italy.
As the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day geographic total spread of COVID-19 taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We compared the total number of reported cases of each country with Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020 till 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in the UK and the EU
In general, the 14-day total prevalence of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK is in line with the province of Hubei (China) (small 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then accelerated this increase on February 28, 2020.
This was largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has been shown to be similarly increasing trends (contextual content).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, in comparison with Italy during the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
It was highlighted that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., only 3 weeks earlier or less, the total number of cases reported in other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy was the first.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 show that this global pandemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in the national public health response and different definitions of potential cases in countries and different protocols for patient selection that require testing to confirm COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which up to 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on the admissions of COVID-19 cases are available in any hospital and/or intensive care unit at EU/EEA levels for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (statistics not shown).
However, the current monitoring data, including the completion of reported cases and the number of deaths, should be collected in a systematic manner.
A 2010-11 study showed that there has been a major shift in availability of intensive care and mid-career beds from 29.2 in Europe to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and Portugal.
This means that these countries will have less and less resources such as Italy (in 2010 there were 12.5 intensive care and mid-care beds for every 100,000 people).
Modeling scenarios for increasing health care capacity, estimates of hospitalizations for COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK that exceed the scope of the intensive care bed >90% of the concern, provided in the Quick Assessment Leave Update of the ECDC on COVID-19.
Since so far there have been cases in EU/EEA countries and specific areas of the UK, and generally hospitals and intensive care units define the region's population, the priority data for information on cases and intensive care beds is available in the regional units of the 2 (NUTS-2) facility.
Current trends from Italy's situation and from other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units must prepare themselves for the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the surge of COVID-19 patients, like in the affected areas of Italy, requires health care, especially extreme care.
As in the recent ECDC Rapid Concern Assessment, I have stated a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach necessary to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which is time-consuming and time-consuming, to provide a time-consuming and mitigating approach to preventative responses, if it is not implemented in time, to understand the number of cases and the expected rapid increase in decision-making.
A list of public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic has also been made in the rapid assessment.
There is a small chance that countries are likely to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care providers.
By failing to do so, it is likely that health care providers in EU/EEA countries will be in need of extreme care due to an increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the most severe severe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far infected more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a devastating for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also spread to bats and cause the same symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, the severity and mortality rates for COVID-19 are lower than for SARS, but it affects older adults and women more than men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about emerging disease, this article seeks to present a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research article.
We will cover the basics about epidemics, virology, epidemics, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 became an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease and the urgency to stay at home for several weeks.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV), which led to the spread of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease was named COVID-19.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 recoveries and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number 1 enemy of the public" and it is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), COVID-19 in less than two months, which includes its virology, epidemic, causes, treatment and diagnosis after the first report of January 7, 2020, and which has been determined to isolate more than 200 patients.
This review attempts to summarize the creative progress in the field of new and rapidly evolving subject matter.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another COVID, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, which spread in 2012).
We will talk about what we have learned so far about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease, as well as some of the other important questions yet to be answered.
For humans, CoV has traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens, mainly due to about 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have had two of the most deadly COVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon this terrible disease spread to many other countries with its own mortality rates.
COVID-19 is the third pandemic in human history.
As shown in the form, figure.1,1, I was first reported at the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the order of CoV was issued.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported in health care providers, which meant it was possible to transmit from person to person.
On January 23, all public transport in the city of Wuhan was shut down and it was locked down.
On January 24, the first medical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the origin of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report came, the disease had already spread to the whole of China and to nearly 50 countries around the world (cf. (cf. 2.2).
Since the situation is rapidly evolving, the ultimate scope and severity of the pandemic is yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, were described in the table below in a multidisciplinary study (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially people aged 65-30.
About half (47.7) of the affected people were over 50 years of age, very little under 20, and only 14 affected were under 10 years of age.
SARS -CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.27/100,000) (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread to Hubei and its surrounding areas.
The COVID-19 diagnosis was on average 5 (9-2) days from the start.
The average duration of growth was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to the mass transit time before the Spring Festival in China, the number of infected people increased rapidly before June 23, 2020.
The confirmed case fatality rate was %1.44 (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was %3.06 (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subset of a large and invasive virus, which is part of the synthesis of RNA of the senses.
They are divided into four generations, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
The membrane spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and The peptideal peptides 4 (DPP4), respectively, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion.
The viral genes release into the cytoplasma, then, after the replication of the viral genes, the genes make up the version of gynecomastia wrapped with RNA and the new Cleocaduce, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
In 10 samples collected from the original location of the outbreak associated with the Huan seafood market in Wuhan, more than 99.98 per cent of SARS-CoV-2 was genetically identified as a new type of beta.
Genetically speaking, SARS-CoV-2 has more to do with SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to the transfer of electron microscopy, particles of SARS-CoV-2 have been found on the finest part of the human respiratory tract epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been found not only as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 is more vulnerable to SARS-CoV by way of A human ACE2, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a secreted lymphatic system through the encoded nodule short lymphatic system and orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play its role in viral pathogenic city and express itself in IFNB, however there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On February 18, 2020, Zhao et al., reported a complex resolution in the structure of the EM at full length of the human ACE2 <0xC3><0x85> islands with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that complexity, in which open and closed changes were combined as a daemon, and ACE2-B0AT1 complexity could bind two S enzymes, which make evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment for the screening of drugs in the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A true and original representative
It is known that, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both from bats, have been transmitted to humans through seaweed cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus is similar to the two SARS-like CoVs of 95% of bats, such as bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, it is not yet known which intermediate representative has helped to cross the barriers to affect humans, and the path of transmission cannot be explained yet.
G, et, al., had suggested snakes as a virus pathogen ranging from bats to humans, including homologous retrieval within the S protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested according to a study that the 99 percent of long-sleeved penguins, ant-eating mice, piglons, and SARS-CoV-2 found in traditional Chinese medicine may be a potential intermediate representative of SARS-CoV-2 due to sex.
However, the %1 difference in spread between the two genomes is still a huge difference, similarly, awaiting the final results of the comprehensive evidence (e.g. (e.g., 33).
Most physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which can survive for up to 48 hours in dry environments and less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 40%-50% in humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is not susceptible to ultraviolet rays, and with a temperature of 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes, or with a 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fatty disinfectants.
In general, the entire human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
In this way, we can refer to previous studies about other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV(e.g.
Normally when a representative is attacked by a virus, the representative's immune system is transmitted through the first type of receptors (PRRs), which have C-type lycan-like receptors, talc-like receptors (TLR), nd-type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through a variety of methods, virus inflammatory processes, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of the number I type interferon (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and stimulate its viral antigens to accelerate micro-phase phagocytosis.
However, SARS-CoV's N lymphatic system can help prevent the virus from responding.
Soon, the favorable immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including <0x2B>CD4 and <0x2B>CD8, play an important role in the defense of cells.
In order to produce specific antibodies to the virus, the T cells of <0x2B>CD4 stimulate the B cells, and the T cells of <0x2B>CD8 directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can block the functions of T cells by giving the T cells an epithet.
Hormonal immunity including C3a and C5a and antibody supplements are essential to combat viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is inhibited by the antibody separated from the recovered patient.
On the other hand, the excess in the immune system creates many free radicals locally that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, the worst case scenario is to stop working many organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is noticeable since the onset of clustering, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
It is common in people who have two to four of the large number of viruses or who have weakened immune functions, and are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the growth period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be an average of 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, according to a study of 1,099 cases, the average duration of growth is 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study shows that the growth period based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to set an effective quarantine time based on the most appropriate period of growth to prevent the transmission of the virus to people who are infected but have no symptoms.
In general, people infected with the virus or infected with it need to quarantine for 14 days.
The quarantine period should be extended to 24 days.
Often the main and early symptom in COVID-19 is fever, with no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache, sore throat, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience shortness of breath and/or shocks a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients with severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid, and freezing improve immediately.
Symptoms of fever and/or shortness of breath and severe fever, even with normal pulmonary imaging, should be tested for early diagnosis of patients.
At the end of December 2019, a demographic study found that among patients with 98 fevers, 76 coughs, 55 breaths and 83 diarrhoea symptoms, 8 percent needed ventilation support.
In two recent studies, similar results have emerged about the cause of a rash, through the transition from a household to a non-symbolic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that patients with MERS-CoV also had primary symptoms of fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients, and MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (%26) and throat inflammation (%21).
It has been proven that SARS patients have the main symptoms of fever (100-99%), dry cough (75-29%), shortness of breath (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and throat inflammation (25-13%), and about 20-14% of patients were in need of ventilation support.
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases globally reached 66,576, the mortality rate in COVID-19 was 2%.
In contrast, SARS-confirmed cases as of November 2002 were 8,096 with a mortality rate of 10%.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate in 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study found that the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2's R0 was higher than 5.71-7.23 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 6.47, while the reproductive range of SARS-CoV's R0 was only 2 to 4.
This table 1.1 presents a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with symptoms, mortality rates, and reproductive numbers.
The data above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two viruses.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Often the jitter begins with a ship of the same family, or the same gathering or ride.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before starting.
However, it has been reported that people can keep the virus inside for up to two weeks without symptoms, and patients who have recovered from the hospital can be infected again, which rings the bell to extend the quarantine time.
In these patients, white blood cells were found to be low or equal at an early level (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells in <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L includes lymphocytes in <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and the level of aspirin amniotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Increased levels of enzymes and myoglobin in the liver and muscles of some patients, and increased C-inactivated lymphoma and etherosite tuberculosis in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer in the blood, Faherbane deficiency, increased, so the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Normal features against the radiography of the chest of COVID-19 patients show two-sided complex shades in the lungs or fades on the ground glass.
In most patients, common pneumonia, severe lung pain, severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs.
Breathing syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, a combination of fluids, and the exchange of increased fibrosis gas are largely compromised.
The inactivity of type I and type II nematodes reduces the level of the head factorant and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung proliferation and their failure.
Therefore, the worst radiographic results of the chest are parallel to the extreme range of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, patients such as SARS and MERS and ARDS and in the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 according to the pathology of viral infection pneumonia in the lungs of the patient who died due to the disease.
The reverse transcription polymers chain response (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the key criteria used to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
On February 13, 2020 in China, due to the high rate of negative lie, which could accelerate the epidemic, the use of medical data for diagnosis began (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, in the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological results must be all-inclusive.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group outlined a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based Sherlock technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which uses a wide range of RNA fragments of artificial SARS-CoV-2 to detect 100x10-18 microlitres (200x10-18 microliters/liter) of RNA at a time not exceeding 100x10-18 microliters.
Hopefully, if confirmed in medical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, primarily therapeutics can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also trying different therapeutic treatments that were previously prescribed or used to treat other COVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These methods of treatment include current and potential antiviral medications, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovery patients' plasma, Chinese medicine and psychotherapy.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs, and perhaps small amounts of other organs that express ACE2, such as the stomach and kidneys.
Of course, shortness of breath and lung failure are the biggest risk and leading cause of death for the patient.
Therefore, to help alleviate symptoms and save lives, general oxygen in terms of severity of the disease, rapid flow of oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation and mechanical interference ventilation are included.
Patients with severe respiratory distress in the respiratory system have to be helped by the use of modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique for treatment through the redundant Corporal Oxygen Membrane (ECMO), the risk of a life-threatening heart attack or respiratory failure.
Additionally, for electro-light care, secondary infection and septic shock treatment and prevention are necessary to protect vital organ functions in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is said that in patients with SARS and MERS, the immune system abuse results in cytokine stromal.
Cytokine strom is a type of systematic inflammation reaction that occurs from a series of releases of Cytokine including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines include immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of severe pain syndrome and various organ failure in the respiratory system.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine strome, especially in severely ill patients.
Corticosteroids and two-cystozoobacteria have been used in the treatment of cytokine stroma.
In the treatment of suppression of other antibodies to the cytokine strom; IFN-y,IL-1 and TNF were blocked; JAK was blocked; JAK was blocked; T cell suppression 4; and HADC blocking, directed modification of the T cell of the immune response.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in SARS, large-scale steroids were used as immunotherapy.
However, heavy doses of steroids were not beneficial in lung disease in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, affecting the diagnosis in a dramatic way.
Nevertheless, it has been recommended to use with caution short courses of corticosteroid dosage to severely ill patients with COVID-19.
To date, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, with the vaccine rheumatoid arthritis in a U.S. patient with COVID-19, the nucleotide analog was found to be effective.
Rimetswere is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Rimetswire was also potentially blocked for the prevention of other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Galead provided China with a mix of it for a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the results of which are much higher than expected.
In addition, baristatinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/retinovir, and rbavirin have been suggested for possible treatments for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
In combination with lopinavir/retinovir, treatment may show diarrhea, diarrhea, nausea, liver damage, and other adverse reactions.
The combination of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from this infectious disease in order to protect other patients from the disease or those who are healthy.
In fact, most recovering patients have a relatively high amount of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) that fights pathogens and other external objects through B-lemo-fits and helps to identify and directly neutralize unique molecules on pathogens.
Based on this, plasma from the blood of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 was collected and admitted in 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms such as inflammation and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood improve in 24 hours.
However, specific treatments have not yet been developed, so it is important to confirm and explain before suggesting its widespread use.
In addition, in addition to seeing the effects of treatment, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies increase immune response, and can cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening poison.
There is usually a decrease in the number of antibodies in the blood, and the demand for plasma for the treatment of severely ill patients is high.
It is difficult to prepare specific antibodies so quickly to fight the pandemic.
Separating B cells from recovered patients and screening an effective antibody against the virus's essential lymphatic system to encode effective antibodies is a delicate and difficult process.
In this way, we can speed up the preparation of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of multiple ingredients in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from acute stage.
For example, Zhu Feng Jie Lu capsules and Li Huang Cheng Wen capsules for the treatment of COVID-19 have been proven to be injectable.
In many provinces of China, patients with COVID-19, of which Gansu, (63.7 per cent), Nanjing (50%), and Hunan (50%), saw a high rate of improvement in treatment rates of 87% of their patients using traditional Chinese medicine, while in Hubei province, which used only 30% of their COVID-19 patients, or less than those in traditional Chinese medicine.
However, this is a fairly rigorous comparison, as the effects of this analysis should include many other factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Bili Zhang and his colleagues published a study on the comparison of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine (WM) treatments.
They found that the recovery of body temperature in the Western medicine <0x2B> traditional Chinese medicine group, the elimination of symptoms, and the duration of hospital stay, were exceptionally shorter than the time required.
Very impressively, the symbolically increased sign (light-to-severe) was significantly lower in the WM group only compared to the WM<0x2B>TCM group (46.2% compared to 7.4%) and the mortality rate (39 percent compared to 8.8%).
Of course, traditional Chinese medicine still awaits more good and controlled trials of its performance and safety at large and in greater concentrations.
It would be interesting to highlight the process of treating traditional Chinese medicine, explaining their effective ingredients or their combinations, if possible.
Suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 are most likely to be highly infectious and even fear of deadly disease, and quarantine individuals experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as fever, tremors, and cough, as well as cartiko steroids can lead to the negative effects of treatment such as sleeplessness, greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients have reported constant stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychological irritability, psychological symptoms, depression, and suicide.
Communicating and quarantine as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, people who are in contact with them, as well as ordinary people who need mental health care should be provided.
Physician support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
An effective vaccine is needed to prevent the transmission of viruses from animals and infected humans to sensitive representatives, and often antiviral treatments are needed to control the emerging virus outbreak.
Efforts have been made to develop long-term and antioxidant neutralizing antibody and/or safety immunity against SARS.
A vaccine with a direct effect in animal samples for SARS was analyzed.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting the elderly, lethal challenge models and animal virus infections cannot be determined before medical studies begin.
This is because SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported so far.
In contrast, MERS outbreaks continue to be found in regions other than the Middle East, where animals have a persistent source of the virus.
The MERS vaccine strategy has been developed using sub-units of inactivating the virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses such as particles and recovered lymphoma, and some of them have been tested on animal samples.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is a challenge due to the long-term (average 18 months) need for vaccine preparation and dynamic mutations of CoVs.
COVID-19 has started showing its medical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without any complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is associated with more disease and deaths in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is important for health care agencies to create a diagnostic model to prioritize their services in low-resource areas.
Based on clinical studies so far reported, the following factors may be linked to the diagnosis or impact of COVID-19 patients (Table 33).
Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily occurred in people aged 65-30, 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the above-mentioned study were over the age of 50.
Patients who are more likely to have underlying chronic complications are more likely to require extreme care, and older than those who do not have such complications (average age of 66 years instead of 51 years), who perform a life-span assessment for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.27/100,000 compared to 0.31/100,000).
Constipation and complications: COVID-19 patients who need extreme care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory distress.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to the positive cholangiocyte of ACE2, which can lead to liver damage in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and primary disease have a strong correlation and that they can interfere with each other.
Laboratory abnormal outcomes: C reactive lymphatic (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been proposed as a possible diagnostic process for the treatment of the disease's reaction and final recovery.
C-reactive lymphatic level correlation has been suggested for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, alloyed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), asparagus aminotransferase (AST), alloyine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are expressed in multiple organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released through tissue damage.
So they are traditional signs of heart disease or liver disease.
Important medical symptoms: The temporary improvement of chest radiography and medical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other tissues to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Usage of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are commonly used to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage as a treatment for infectious disease.
Since multivitamins of carticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered avascular osteoncerosis with lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, very small amounts of steroid should be used for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental Stress: As mentioned above, many patients suffered unusual stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to prolonged quarantine and observing the unreasonable death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is necessary to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to bring these patients back to a stress-free and normal life.
According to demographic studies done so far, it seems that the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are different from SARS.
In addition to wrapping up in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also wrap up in the upper respiratory tract, and cause mild or no symptoms like the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or during the growth period can produce large amounts of viruses during daily activities, which makes it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is severely ill, while there is not much transmission in the early stages.
In this way, the current COVID-19 pandemic is far more severe than the SARS epidemic and is much more difficult to control.
At present in China, hopes and efforts are underway to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by keeping Wuhan and surrounding cities locked down and the entire population in constant quarantine.
While these measures are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, it is reducing the number of new patients, a sign of slowing down the pandemic.
The best part is that the pandemic will end in March and the stage of its dwarf swing will be in three to four months.
However, some experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which is more infectious than SARS, will not be eradicated in 2020.
Era Longi et al., set a model for predicting the outcomes of the global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A group of Canadians reported that mid-turbine and throat patients who recovered from the hospital two weeks ago found they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the newly identified virus could cause influenza circadian rhythms.
However, based on the decline in the number of new cases, there are promising indicators in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
In fact, one million cases were predicted with half a million deaths in Ebola.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in the spread of the infected disease and eventually eliminated or remained with humans like less-infected viruses.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been compared with SARS and MERS in the following format (55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with contaminated substances from the virus.
The virus is also found in the pancreas, which creates a new possibility of transmission from the pancreas to the mouth.
A recent study conducted on 138 cases reported that 41 percent of the cases were likely to be caused by non-surgical infections, 17 patients with pre-existing illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, householders, colleagues, and even those who are in contact with patients or infected people should be very careful.
To reduce the risk of infection, the first line of defense is to wear a mask on the face; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces of objects, from where they can reach others.
However, only N95 (Serial <0x23>1860) masks can prevent the inhalation of small viral particles from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viral particles can enter completely, SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both are about 85 nm.
Even if five surgical masks are combined, the particles can penetrate them, so those who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Serial <0x23>1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care workers should wear isolation gowns to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he had to wear an N95 mask; the virus almost entered his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should wear a transparent shield or spring on the face when working with patients.
It is highly recommended for people in affected or potentially affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with sterile soap, try to self-quarantine indoors and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered appropriate.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is the highest homogeneity of SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, and should have caused a high alert for China based on a deep recall of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the directorate of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that the novel virus has a less infectious and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and that preventing and controlling the disease is not a problem.
The message brought the public's alarm, especially when they were preparing for the Spring Festival, to a remarkable degree, and wasted time controlling the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China may have made significant improvements in the future by learning from this difficult lesson.
For example, these agencies should be careful when making (1) public announcements as each word is important to the citizens and may change their behavior and decisions; (2) to improve the public's perception of the public and to make informed and informed decisions; and (4) to be sensitive to the general public's information rather than to the public's ability to monitor and respond; (3) to the public's satisfaction rather than to the public's ability to respond.
The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and around 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of re-spreading of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults and women more than young people, and its severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people than young people.
SARS mortality rates are higher than COVID-19 (%10.91 compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to stop the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA may be negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Otherwise, the virus can be positive again in recovered patients.
This results in a dramatic increase in the spread of the virus.
In view of the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homogeneity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two beta-SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Who were the original representatives, from bats, to the middle species of the virus transmitted to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't effectively reduce the transition process and it can spread again at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing show that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to this ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how pathological changes occur as a result?
The virus also connects to cells that express ACE2 in other organs.
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic continue?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or will it continue to happen from time to time as a result?
This is important, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic and get our lives back to normal as soon as possible.
The origins of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have led to the mutual evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host organisms, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known for mild illnesses such as common cold.
The severe respiratory distress system (SARS) and the Middle-Eastern respiratory system (MERS) kicked in to show how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again highlighted CoVs, and its rapid transmission and reduction in pathogenesis compared to its sister SARS-CoV surprised us.
HCoV infection is an infection transmitted from animals to humans and it serves us to understand the animal source of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to be intermediate host organisms.
Identifying host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating the CoV-hosted organism in animals gives important warnings about pathogenesis CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the knowledge available about the seven HCoVs, in which we focus on their animal origin and mixed-income transmission, along with the date of their discovery.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the point of view of the evolution of different viruses and their genetics.
In the same context, the current COVID disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic will be discussed.
In addition, the requirements for successful host animal changes and the effects of virus protection on the severity of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviruses, including a group of mutants, positive senses, single stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses that use large genes such as 26 to 32 kilobytes between RNA viruses were called "CoV" due to the appearance of crown-like morphology from the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have similar, uncombined genes that are involved in the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genes consist of two large open frames of reading mounted on each other (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polymeric diagram of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polyphenols have 16 more non-synthetic enzymes, designated nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genitals contain ORFs for structural lymph nodes, including nodes(S), membrane(E), membrane(M) and neonuclear lymphatic (N)
A large number of specific series of assistive enzymes are also encoded through coVs of different series.
Based on the difference in the sequences of the lymphatic system, coVs have been classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV generation mostly comprising of HCoVs, and are further divided into sequences (A, B, C and D).
Evidence from the fibroids showed that, most bats and rats are the source of the genes of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the largest deposits of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently crossed barriers of different species, and some of them have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coVs (HCOVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Typically, HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause mild colds and/or diarrhea-like symptoms.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, making the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extraplemonary manifestations more likely in patients.
In the mid-1960s, the strain of HCoV-229E, B814, had isolated nasal discharges from patients with mild colds.
Since then, more and more information has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, before the spread of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS epidemic in 2003 is the deadliest in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East resulted in a persistent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula, which spread to the whole world.
The 2019 Novel (2019-nCoV, later called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which took over 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world has to prepare for the upcoming global pandemic SARS-CoV-2.
The source of all seven HCoVs is animal bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support the evolutionary origins of all HCoVs from bats, where the virus is well adaptable and exhibits non-pathogenic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed numerous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
The source animal tracking of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the nature history, the power of spread, and the mechanisms for the restriction of transmission in different species.
This could also help or guide in finding a host of SARA-CoV-2 reservoirs, middle and rearing animals, with important implications in preventing future relapses.
In this review, we will present an overview of source animals, mixed-cell transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the shared idea that the patriarchal viruses of HCoVs are usually non-psychotogenic in host organisms of their natural habitats and become pathogenic after being transferred to their new host organism.
We also look at the evolutionary trend of HCoVs, which often lead to an increase in transmission with a decrease in pathogenic genes.
The results of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed in this context.
CoVs of animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain B814 of HCoV-229E was first isolated, the substance released from the nose of patients with mild cold, was isolated to various animals infected with various CoVs, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs by historical order will be informative and instructive.
In 1966, HCoV-229E pressure was isolated before the respiratory tract of patients with respiratory tract infections, and was later adopted to increase WI-38 lung cell lines.
In 10 to 20 percent of patients infected with HCoV-229E, symptoms of mild cold, including headaches, sneezing, restlessness, and a sore throat with fever and cough have been reported.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of the organs and then put into the serial pathway of the brain of small rats.
The medical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infections resemble those of those who have had HCoV-229E, which are not symbolically different from the pathogens of other respiratory tracts such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and they are more widespread in moderate climates during the winter.
In general, the growth time of these two viruses is less than a week, after which the disease persists for about 2 weeks.
According to a voluntary study of humans, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E cause mild colds.
Only a few immunocompromised patients show severe infection of the lower part of the respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia," was first well documented as a global epidemic caused by HCoV in human history and is the SARS-CoV etiological agent, the third detected HCoV.
The first case of SARS could be traced in late 2002 in China's Zhang Dong province.
The SARS epidemic that spread across many countries and continents resulted in a total of 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, in which the growth period is 4 to 7 days, and the 10th day of the disease is at the viral load limit, could increase to about two secondary cases.
The patient infected with SARS-CoV initially has symptoms of muscle aches, colds, fever, discomfort, and colds, followed by symptoms of zyctomy, cough, and shortness of breath.
In rare laboratory tests of lymphocytes, SARS, it is normal to have irregular liver function and some elevated cytokines.
In patients with SARS, there is also an observation of the spread of allergens, the spread of epithelial cells, and the increase of macrophages.
After this, about 20 to 30 percent of patients require extreme care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, multiple organs, including the lower respiratory tract, liver and kidney, can be affected, usually with cytokine strom, which can be fatal in patients with particularly low immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient, who had travelled from Zhuang Zhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, great efforts have been made on the research of HCoV.
HCov-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it is found in young children, the elderly, and low-intensity patients with respiratory disease.
The disease caused by HCoV-BL63 is common in inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes, asthma, fever, and nasal congestion.
Another independent study described separating the same virus from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 in the common respiratory disease is about 4.7%, and its symptoms are severe at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a blockage cough, also known as cramps.
In the same year, a 71-year-old Hong Kong mother who was hospitalized due to pneumonia and inflammation of the nasal cavity was isolated from HCoV-HKU1.
With pneumonia obtained from the community and inflammation in the nasal cavity, HCoV-HKU1 associated with severe asthma was reported.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which have mild respiratory illness, were found worldwide.
These four community-generated HCoVs are very well-adapted to humans and are generally less likely to cause a mutation in highly pathogenic disease, although accidents have been reported for unknown reasons, such as the more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63, which causes severe respiratory incontinence.
Usually when these HCoVs have the ability to transmit and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they become less-intensive malignant or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old Saudi patient who was suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure in 2012.
Where most laboratory-confirmed cases are found in the Middle East, and sometimes in close contacts with secondary outbreaks, imported cases are found in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, there was a secondary outbreak in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
Medical descriptions of MERS are similar to SARS, which has the characteristics of advanced severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have severe kidney failure, which is very unique to MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases accounted for 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses found in humans.
From mid-December 2019 to late-December 2019, the last time a large number of pneumonia-related infections were detected from Wuhan, China's province of Hubei.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the ongoing outbreak of respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global concern, calling it a public health emergency, and calling the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with 3.4% of those treated having died.
In particular, the death toll in these cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough, and sickle-cell infections.
It has also been seen in some patients.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia and it can increase the syndrome of severe respiratory distress.
Although 82% of high nucleotide tides have a constant similarity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is a flag of different branches of the pathogenic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported symptoms of infected non-symptomatic subjects that could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in comparison and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First, HCoVs are very similar in duration and duration of disease growth.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the other four derived from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, it has been generally seen that during the infection of HCoVs obtained from the SARS-CoV-2 community, including nonspecific, mild or with no symptoms, show the characteristics of its infection.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as a SARS-CoV infection, although this ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting features such as HCoVs obtained from the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as much as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after entering the human body.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2, like other HCoVs, can be found in favorable samples.
Although at least in some circumstances that remain to be explained in future studies, whether SARS-CoV-2, like the case of SARS-CoV, plays an important role in oral grace transfer.
It will also be of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 will appear seasonally, like HCoVs obtained from the community.
After all, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transition, pathogenesis, and sustainable spread, will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The four HCoVs obtained from the community, adapting well in humans, cause mild symptoms.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types can be survivors of the global epidemic of chronic HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans that cause severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To do this, sufficiently to counter the host organism's restriction, and the HCoVs that collect the desired change will have to be replicated in humans.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people it affects, the more likely it is that humans will fully adapt to it.
If it is properly adopted, then it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other measures that control the infection.
For many years, four CoVs obtained from the community have been circulating in the population, causing a common cold among the immune-controlled individuals.
These viruses do not need animal reservoirs.
In contrast, humans with highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well and their transmission to humans cannot be maintained.
They need to grow and thrive in their animal habitats, and possibly find an opportunity to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more medium and wide host animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has features such as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least at the moment, it is more capable of transmitting like HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs obtained from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether humans will adopt it completely and whether it will circulate in humans without any reservoirs or intermediate host animals.
Before talking about the source of the organisms of HCoVs, it would be better to talk about the evolution, nature, storage, medium and amplitude of the host animals of HCoVs, and their characteristics.
An animal, if it has a closely related ethnic association, acts as an evolutionary host organism of HCoVs, sharing high-type similarities at the level of continuity of nucleotides.
Ethnic viruses usually communicate well in this host organism and are non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the host animal shelters HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host organisms are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is introduced to humans at the time of introduction or before the middle host organism, it is not able to better adapt to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and then play the role of a host that greatly accelerates human infection in humans.
If HCoVs are not able to maintain the transmission within the middle host organism, it will go in the closed path of infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the middle host organism and even establish long-term nutrition.
In such a case, the middle host organism becomes the host organism of the natural reserve.
Epidemiological data have revealed with disappointment that the SARS index cases have a history of contact with sports animals.
An investigation into the subsequent spread of the virus revealed that there was a higher incidence of SARS-CoV lgG in animal traders than in the general population.
In the live animal market, the first masked palm civet cats (Pagoma larvata) and a raccoon dog have been identified to have SARS-CoV-like viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supports that no SARS was reported after killing all the Seat cats in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masks from forests or farms were largely negative for SARS-CoV without appearing in the live animal market, which suggests that masks from palm-seated cats may be acting only as a wide-ranging intermediate host organism but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since Zhang Zhou's markets contain antibodies to SARS-CoV in 80% of different animals, many small-breeding animals cannot be excluded from the possibility of working as an enlarged intermediate host organism of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear as closed pathways of SARS host organisms.
As a result of the discovery of the natural host animal of SARS-CoV, the closely related bat coV, called SARS-related rhinovirus chimpanzee coV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), has been identified in the Chinese horse chimney chimney.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats co-exist with SARS-CoV in 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the host organisms of human pathogenesis.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
Human enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1, obtained from a sample of bats' wastes, was shown to be used as a receptor for bats, seat cats, and human ACE2 entry-cells.
Interestingly, Sera's recovery SARS patient was able to inhibit WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related SARS-CoV of bat breeds, which share 95% nucleotide continuity similarity.
Despite the extreme similarity between the two viruses, however, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV parent virus and that bats are not an immediate storage host of SARS-CoV.
The strain of MERS-CoV of the same group was analyzed as beta-CoV-HKU4 and beta-CoV-HKU5, filo-genetic analysis.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV, the same representative receptor for the virus' entry, use diphenyl peptides 4 (DPP4).
RNA polymers dependent on MERS's RNA identified from Europe and Africa are closely related to the counterparts in beta-CoV.
As of now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related bat CoV-HKU25 share a similarity of only 87 percent of the nucleotide sequence.
Thus, bats cannot be the host of the immediate reservoir of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East found that in several African countries, like the Middle East camels, there are a cobalt camel sero-positories for specific inhibitory antibodies to MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nose of a cobalt camel, and this further indicates that the camels act as the real host organism reservoir of MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that, experimentally, in camels infected with MERS-CoV, there were generally mild symptoms but large-scale virus outbreaks were observed.
In particular, the virus spreads not only through the respiratory tract from infected camels, but also through the graceful oral tract, which is the main route of the virus flowing from bats.
Questions remain, however, as there is no history of MERS-confirmed multiple cases linked to camels before the onset of symptoms, including human-to-human transmission or unknown animal species that shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a 96.2 percent nucleotide similarity partner with the isolated CoV RaT13 bat.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the paternal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is great for assigning.
I mean, beta SARS-CoV-2 can't be the host organism of a direct reservoir of beta-CoV-2 until almost identical beta-CoVs are found in the future.
Most likely, Hunan's seafood wholesale market, which is associated with many early cases of COVID-19 and which is likely pointing to animal-to-human transmission, will be the middle host animals of wildlife species sold and killed by SARS-CoV-2.
A number of recent studies based on meta-genetic continuity have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as penguins (Mans Javanika) may also be a shelter for the ancestral beta coVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These nodule penguin coV genes share with SARS-CoV-2 in proportion to the %85-92 nucleic acid sequence.
However, these nucleotides are as closely related to RATG13 with about 90% identification at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
These are sub-genres of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like strains in the phylogenetic tree, with a %97.4 amino acid constant identification, similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD).
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite the high degree of continuous matching genetics range, are more diverse.
In previous studies about the diseased Pagolan, viral metabolites were reported from samples of phosphorus, which are similar to the corresponding SARS-CoV-2.
This study has adopted a variety of assembly methods and manual safeguards for partial genetic sequencing, which is about 86.3% of full-length viral genes.
We cannot exclude the possibility that penguin is one of the middle host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence of support for SARS-CoV-2 directly from Penguin's source due to the continuity difference between SARS-CoV-2 and Penguin's SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be established in bats, penguins, and other dairy animals.
While, the best sequence similarities have been found in the receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and penguin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best broader genetic sequence similarities.
It is highly speculative that the chosen mediation between SARS-CoV-2 and the receptor-binding domain of beta-CoVs related to the Pagolan SARS-CoV-2 is driven by careful evolution.
The third wild animal type has been suggested in favor of recombination between beta-CoVs related to Penguin SARA-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
The spread of recombinant synthesis between beta coVs, exists as a stimulant force in evolution.
A decision on the direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be made.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied to be the animal source.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the original source of both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be beta-CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rats.
It has been reported that ARCoV.2, a bat covid terminology in North America, has shown a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another beta-CoV termed hepatocytes/Ghanahuama/19/2008, whose father in Ghana, the camels are also suspected to be its middle host organism.
For clarification, the current knowledge about the animal source of identified HCoVs is summarized in Figures 1 and Figure 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events involving the transmission of mixed algae of HCoVs in history.
When the domestic livestock HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans around 1890, a global epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of the mixed algae transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Beta-Alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha covid.
A number of evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, there may be human contact with bats in a shared ecological niche, not alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related beta-alpha CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in beta, while alpha-alpha CoV is caused by respiratory disease spread in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha CoV was not found in pets.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out the possibility that alpacas acquire alpha CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha CoVs act as a genetic predisposition to an HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels can act as intermediaries, just like cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit viruses to humans.
MERS-CoV serves as the best example of mixed algae transmission from bats to a cobalt camel and camel to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a pool of virus types for the transfer of genetic fragments and intersections and the exchange of intersections.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, are favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus spreader'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been introduced into a mountain camel for decades.
It has been well adapted to camels that have been transformed from a direct host organism to a host organism of stable and natural reserves.
MERS-CoV maintains a very mild disease and relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its occasional transmission in humans is an accident and humans are the closed path host organisms of MERS-CoV because they cannot maintain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of penguin, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, penguin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in penguin.
They may be the closed path host animal for SARS-CoV-2 BTA-CoV, which is similar to Seat Cats in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or reject a number of possibilities for the mixed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats can be the source of SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans share an ecological niche with bats by means of knives or coal mining.
Second, the penguin may be one of the fastest intermediate host organisms, with the new SARS-CoV-2-related virus being introduced.
Humans are prone to the virus through eating and drinking.
It is possible that a number of lactating animals, including domestic animals, are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
In the survey of domestic and wild animals, antibodies are guaranteed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 can occur in the third species that interact with both bats and penguins.
The search for the animal's source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major mechanisms by the viral in crossing several types of barriers.
First, they have relatively high mutation rates in the RNA copy.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the rate of change determined by CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high", while the average rate of change per year on each site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of Novel Host Animals' CoV, is 10-4.
CoVs have proofreading external boncals, whose deletion results in better mutation, attention-seeking, even irreversible.
Interestingly, the New Cleotype Analog Remdesivir is known to suppress the copy of CoVs through the inhibition of RNA polymerase dependent on this external bonanza and RNA.
Remdesivir is a highly intelligent agent tested as a contraceptive SARA-CoV-2 in medical practice.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is one million times higher than that of its host organisms.
Also, often times when CoVs can't adapt well to the host organism, it has a higher rate of mutation.
Compare the highest mutation rate of SARS-CoV, so the mutation rate of SARA-CoV-2, which is apparently well-adapted in humans, is low.
Probably, it has already adapted to another host organism closer to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a cobalt camel, applies.
In theory, it is unlikely that the enlarged genes will have an immediate effect on vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the genes present in CoVs demonstrate the use of extrastimulants in genetic modification for large RNA changes and retrieval, thus increasing the potential for mutual evolution of the mixed species, which is beneficial for the appearance of Novel CoVs when the conditions are favorable.
It is supported by a number of unique reading frames and lemma functions to the 3' end of the genes to code these.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection", CoVs often randomly switch to RNA templates.
During the copying of CoV RNA, in the host organism acting as a mixer, the dor changes frequently.
In order to develop new coVs, the full length of the highly homologous and subgenic RNAs can be recombinant.
Evidence of a natural combination of phylogenetics has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat coV-HKU9.
The transmission of the virus to the host organism
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, viral interaction with the host organism receptor is an important factor in the effective and mixed species transmission.
With this, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a common example, which showed positive selection during mixed algae transmission.
In addition to a comparative analysis of the isolation of SARS-CoVs of humans and serotonin, SARS-CoV has the concept of rapidly melting into various host organisms, especially with the mutation of the receptor binding domain of S lymphoma.
In general, the receptor-binding domains in the S lymphatic system of CoV interact with the receptor and are strongly selected through the host organism's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 fragment is the 318th to 510th amino acid, which is bound to its corticosteroids for human ACE2 as well as viral entry.
SARS-CoV receptors are capable of identifying ACE2 receptors for the binding domain that are different animals, including bats, seaweed cats, rats, and raccoon dogs, which allow the virus's mixed genital transmission.
In fact, only the remains of 6 amino acids in the receptor binding domain were found to be different in the solitary viral of the human and septic cat, 4 of which are in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations, which can enhance the interaction of the pointed lymphatic system with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can prove to be an important substrate for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting, that SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV shares a single cellular receptor.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the lymphatic system indicates that the necessary association of its S lymphatic system with human ACE2 may change.
Of course, the study of a tabulated electromagnetic spectrum indicates that the association between human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV's S lymphoma is -10 to -20 times greater than the association between SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other sub-receptors will be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silica acids for HCoV-OC43.
They can account for the successful adaptation of these CoVs after the mixed in vivo transmission from their host animal to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, HCoV is monitored by the result of mixed intravenous transmission, depending on another host organism and by binding factors.
The spread of these host haemoglobins between humans and host organisms with natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as bats, a haemoglobin camel, and mice, can hinder the mixed species transmission.
HCoVs are the binding factors of an angry host organism's dependence for a successful mixed-income transmission and disruption of host organisms.
In this regard, the molecular identities and characteristics of this important part of the virus's interaction with the host organism remain to be determined.
The dependence of host organisms and the uncomplicated broad genetic testing of binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may be beneficial with the use of the latest technology of CRISPR.
Novel HCoVs: Back to the Ground
The diversity of bat CoV provides ample opportunities for the release of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a pool of the genes of an HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also increase the development of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a nodule coding gene, retains the ability to rapidly change the phenotype of the viral.
In SARS-CoV-supported enzymes, ORF8 is considered important in the adaptation of humans, as SARS-CoV-related beta viruses were isolated, but it found different codes of ORF8 enzymes.
At the beginning of the pandemic, 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV have been identified.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is an adaptive mutation that promotes the transfer of host organisms.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with a series of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of recombinant RNA polymerase depending on RNA were identified.
The locations of the retrieval were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been seen that the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in a Kohan camel in Saudi Arabia, had to experience recurrence incidents between different strands.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recurrence cases have also been observed in other CoVs, with HCoVs recombining with other animal coVs with their non-recommended genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unpredictable changes in viral genes, potentially resulting from avoiding selective pressure, such as the host organism's immune system, from getting rid of the virus.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in the HCoV-229 E's prototype strand, causing the removal of two nucleotides.
Although HCoV-229E can be observed in bats and camel viruses, the alpha alpha -CoV shows a single neonucleotide intake, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of Novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in the host organisms of their reservoirs.
When bats are infected with CoVs, one is detected without symptoms or mild symptoms, which indicates a correlation between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats have good compatibility with anatomy and physical coVs.
For example, defects in activating the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce dynamic pathology through CoVs.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in bats is inhibited by low levels of expression of the receptor NKG2/CD94 of the natural killer cell and the major histocompatibility complexes class I.
Furthermore, reactivating the high levels of oxygen produced by the high metabolic activity of bats (ROS) by suppressing the copy of both CoVs, and by influencing proof reading through the Exorcism Boncalis to create highly pathogenic virus strains.
More pathogenic CoV strains can be developed through recombinant synthesis, which can lead to the adaptation of host organisms to the properties of nodule or lipids.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their reservoir host organisms such as bats and camels.
They reproduce vigorously without the immune response of the powerful host organism.
In this, the secrets of why symptoms are shown undiagnosed and what causes severe cases of human infection are hidden.
Acute symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokine strom, which, with a powerful immune response, causes more severe lung damage.
On the other hand, in an unsigned disease-causing, immune response has become de-calibrated by a copy of CoV.
The same strategy has a beneficial effect on non-invasive immune response in the treatment of SARA-CoV-2.
The reaction of interferon in bats is particularly powerful.
Therefore, the organization of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
In addition, the function of inflammation of NLRP3 in bats is impaired.
For this reason, it may be beneficial to prevent NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emission of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea emerging through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a bat beta-CoV has been found to share a 95% neonucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a beta-CoV that is sharing a%96 nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While sewage and other animals in the market have been found to shelter viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct middle host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Penguin beta-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, which means that penguin beta-CoVs are acting in the form of one of the intermediate host organisms.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have come to light again.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has radically changed our view of animal sources and animal stocks of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence suggests that the source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is bats, and that it has been transmitted to humans through a middle host organism.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection is caused by the interaction between humans and serotonin in the markets, the SARS epidemic can be effectively eradicated by closing the meat markets and killing serotonin.
For the same reason, in view of the discovery of multiple sequences of pangolin beta-CoVs closely linked to SARS-CoV-2, pengolin should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, future investigations are yet to determine when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through penguins and other dairy animals.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in a mountain camel for a long time.
For locals, these camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool, as well as an important means of transportation.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, just like what was done in China's markets, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
In order to prevent the recent spread of MERS, along with other measures to control the infection, a logical approach should be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS for camels.
Since we are not able to eradicate these viruses, they can cause the emergence of new genetic variants.
CoVs of species and species of animals are circulating in the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs with potency in animals are very diverse.
As a result of the emission of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to be developed and restored.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wildlife in some places in China should abandon the food culture.
With the trials of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans should be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many features that cause the spread of viruses, if people are educated, chances of interacting with humans' bats and other wildlife species can be reduced.
For a better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts, continuous monitoring of lactating animals is essential, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the virus from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, the virus of diseases transmitted from animals to humans can be prevented more effectively by staying away from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of the virus.
Several pieces of the puzzle of being the source animal of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ethnic virus of SARS-CoV-2 to penguin, it will be interesting to see if bats and penguins can share the same environmental force under what conditions.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transition to humans, it should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third-breeding animal acts as a real intermediary, it must be explained how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and penguins.
Finally, because many other milking animals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2, they should be monitored and tested for infection.
If bats, penguins, or any other mammals are involved, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent viruses, which are almost identical, will be identified in its natural representatives.
The ongoing investigation in this field will explain the evolutionary journey of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, as well as having a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic standards of "suspected cases" and "verified cases" of COVID-19 must be renewed
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Rapid Advisory Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, it is gradually increasing based on our awareness and knowledge of the results of ongoing research and experience in medical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our Guidelines, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, stating that the latest diagnostic standards of "suspect case" and "verified case" are in line with the final guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version).
In December 2019, the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named as severe respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick advisory guide and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He has gained a lot of attention since his release.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on the results of ongoing research in our awareness and knowledge and the experience of clinical practice, it is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), a total of seven issues were issued from January 16, 2020, to March 3, 2020, with some fundamental changes being made in the context.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al., suggesting easy scoring based on their medical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guideline and is a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We give thanks to them for their generosity, and we give thanks for their generosity.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the latest trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis of any one of the features of the epidemiological history with two items of medical description is required to confirm the suspected case, or three items of medical description without a clear history of the epidemic:
History of Pandemic Diseases: (1) Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, such as contacts with COVID-19 cases in the past 2 days; (2) contacts with SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive symptoms in the first 14 days); (3) contacts with the city and surrounding area of Wuhan.
Medical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with conceivable characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the count of white blood cells in the early onset stage shows the normal, reduced, or low lymphocyte site count.
The pathogenic or serological evidence should have a diagnosis of a suspected case with one of the following: (1) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in acute phase l-gV; (2) a sequence of whole viral genes showing high concentrations of known novel coronaviruses; (3) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) counts.
The detection of pathogens in blood samples was included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) counts; and the serological evidence was included in the seventh count.
Research-based editing is underway to find a more nucleic acid-detecting kit to quickly diagnose confirmed quality, as well as take respiratory tract samples including blood samples that increase the availability of different samples, and help bring positive results for specific antibodies.
In addition, there is a lot of evidence that reminds us of caution from traditional symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be refreshed, as they have classified the person in "low risk" without medical symptoms.
The score system also needs to be verified in further medical practice and studies.
As a result, we expect more direct evidence to come and ask readers to give their feedback.
To diagnose "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we recommend that they be tracked and complied with the latest guidelines in their home countries.
In order to offer help, our team updates our guide in a timely manner.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number of daily deaths.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of today, the Bangladesh Institute for Pandemic Diseases, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of recorded cases included 114 active cases and 33 recoveries that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news report, Dr. Mirjeedi Sabrina Flora, director of the IEDCR, said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mir Jedi, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
An official at the hospital told the Anadloa Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif al-Rahman, director of the Bengali anti-corruption, who was taken care of at the Metro Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridge Minister Abed-al-Qader said that public transport will be closed for a long time from this coming week under initial planning.
Initially, the closure of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on April 4 on Saturday.
Transportation of essential commodities -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
On March 8, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally exceeded one million.
Nearly 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease that appears to be caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and the first death related to the coronavirus in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea has claimed that it is one of the few countries that has so far been free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases after 10 hours on April 4 at Central Europe time (0800 UTC).
The United States has recorded more than 244,000 coronavirus cases, linked to 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted data from Johns Hopkins University as saying that as of Wednesday, more than 1,000 Americans had died due to the coronavirus infection.
Across the world, countries have announced strict measures to stop the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, the head of Sobiane, extended the city's lock-down to May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments would continue until April 30 without the Russians working.
Portugal's parliament voted in favor of a 15-day extension of the national emergency; the vote was passed in the case of 215 votes in favor, 10 in favor, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia extends the curfew in the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah for a full day: Previously, the curfew was effective from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand will impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
In Australia, the size of the toilet paper in stores has been reduced to every transaction.
On Sundays and Saturdays, Australian stores chains Walworth and Coles cut down the purchase restrictions for toilet paper in all stores nationwide to two and a pack per transaction.
ALDI also introduced a pack limit, on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on the checkouts, and on the Facebook back pages of the chains.
Due to the fear of COVID-19, it was reported to be stored by buyers in case of the need for self-isolation of people.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for delivery at home to one pack per order.
These changes followed a four-pack ban on each transaction introduced by Woolworth and Cowells on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Quills, in a media release on March 8, said that with a four-pack ban in one place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery", and the demand was "unprecedented," while ALDI said in a Facebook post on Tuesday, calling it "unprecedented."
According to a spokesman for Woolworths, last week's sales were "substantially high."
Costco's store in Canberra also restricted last week's allowed number to two packs.
In order to reduce the shortage, the Coalition ordered large packages from suppliers and increased the supply chain, the Woolworths ordered additional storage, while ADLI stocked for special initial availability on the day of the project.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to expand the stockpile, but the local council's ban on delivery truck time has made it difficult.
They are in addition to increased production costs, because suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the release of the store, some stores could not run specific Wednesdays.
Dr. Gary Martymer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report to News.com.au that stores fill up stores every night.
He said that the toilet tissue paper is a big thing, due to which it has a small amount of storage in its number, and, when it is sold, leaves the wide space of the shelf empty, which makes sense of a hard scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman on ABC News said, "Killed and Woolworth's review [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilets and sanitizers can go [buy] and if it's in quantity, maybe you can reduce the panic.
The maker of the tissue paper of a crimp-giving recycled toilet said last Wednesday that they would be without storage.
According to News.com.au's report, Camberly Clark, who manufactures cleans toilet tissue, and Solaris, who manufactures sorbets, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a property buying and selling site, reported that some of the property sellers in Melbourne offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction, when buyers had time because of the long weekend on Labor Day.
In the journal Darwin, NT News' Thursday issue, eight-page insulations were added, which meant they were cut and used as toilet tissue paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were actually reluctant to impose the restrictions, which they said they had no plans to introduce a ban on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for masks, sanitizers, dry items, handwashing and other products, including flour, is also high.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, British supermarket purchases were observed to be limited to a pack of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a global epidemic.
While the "pandemic" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to how dangerous certain cases are, the World Health Organization stressed the need for action by governments.
All countries can still change the face of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and activate their people in response.
We are very concerned about both dimensions of this disease because of its speed and severity and the worrying extent of its action against it.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, the former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "extraordinary."
He said in a February report published in CNN, "Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected in such a sequence from the onset to the global outbreak."
He said: "We have never seen a global pandemic that has been hit by the coronavirus.
"And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he continued.
The new status of the pandemic came after the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The important thing is, it is that it is on the verge of further destruction."
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide was 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, and declared a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and identified as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have died.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 3% in Algeria to 8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Complications can include symptoms of pneumonia and severe breathing difficulties.
The duration from the appearance of the disease to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be in the range of two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment - suggested precautions include hand washing, mouthwash when coughing, staying away from other people, and monitoring and isolation for people who they suspect are infected.
Officials around the world have also supported travel restrictions, quarantine, curfew enforcement, workplace risk control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has disrupted a number of global social, cultural, religious, political and cultural events, and led to widespread shortages of goods due to the pandemic.
Schools and universities in 193 countries either closed at home or at the local level, affecting about 99.4% of the world's population.
Misconceptions about the virus have surfaced online and there have been incidents of discrimination and discrimination against the Chinese people, other people of Eastern and Southeast Asia color and ethnicity, and those where the virus is more prevalent.
Low inflows and closures of major industries have led to a reduction in air density and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan (headquarters of Hubei province) reported a collection of pneumonia cases on December 31, 2019 for an unknown reason, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which is why it is believed to be a breed of animal diseases.
The virus that causes the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that was not closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first person to show symptoms of the disease appeared on 1 December 2019.
Two-thirds of the initial incidents reported in December 2019 were related to markets.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post recommended in an unconfirmed report that an incident of a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province on 17 November 2019 may be the first - on 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although cases are declining in China, new cases have been reported in Italy, Iran and South Korea, due to a sudden increase in cases in China.
The number of cases may also be reduced, especially in people with common symptoms of the disease.
On February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of global cases. Britain's chief scientific adviser Patrick Villans estimated that 60% of the UK's population would be affected before being able to get away from being an effective crowd.
According to the official protocol, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 has been confirmed to be positive.
As of March 23, no country has tested 3% of its population, and many countries have an official policy not to test only people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients were not detected and that unregistered patients were the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates for the primary re-production for COVID-19 are (R0) 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people who have recovered from COVID-19 have recovered.
For people who don't stop, the duration of symptoms from the appearance of the disease to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths in China are among people over the age of 60 and 75% of people with pre-existing illnesses, including heart disease and diabetes - the official number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually consists of those who have tested positive for COVID-19, according to official protocols.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 may be several, as these deaths do not include people who die without a test - for example at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic was higher than the official death toll of x4-5.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know [the number of reported deaths] is low", confirming the first reported deaths in the United States in 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside of mainland China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions, with the exception of the freezing South, reported deaths from each continent. Several joint measures are used to determine deaths.
The number varies with region and time, and the quality of testing, treatment system, treatment options, post-pandemic time and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health are affected. The incidence and mortality ratio is determined by the number of deaths in a given period of time.
Based on data from June Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths and incidents as of now 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The proportion of cases and deaths in China (from the onset of symptoms to the onset of the disease) has fallen from 17.3% to 0.7% (from the onset of the disease to the onset of the onset of the disease as on 1st February 2020). Other measures include the non-infectious death rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people who die from the disease, and the percentage of those who die from it.
These numbers are not for a specific time period, and range from infection to the final solution of the matter to a particular population.
Many experts have tried to count this number for a particular population.
The Oxford University's Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the overall mortality rate from infections in this pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate corresponds to a statistical study analyzing the results of the first COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that this pandemic can be controlled.
The extent and duration of the pandemic are different and uncertain in terms of location.
Mike Bonnie of Penn State University said: "If you don't check, the spread of the virus usually grows as high as the plateau and starts to come down when the disease no longer has a host.
But it's impossible to say exactly when it will happen, but at the same time a reasonable plan will be made."
Zhong Nanshan, China's top medical adviser, stressed that "it could be over by June" if all countries were to be encouraged to follow the World Health Organization's advice on preventing the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Chersky told Adam of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely continue to circulate for a year or two."
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, distance from each other and other measures would be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will—completely eradicate—because it's easily transmissible" and that "it will turn into a seasonal disease, and will come back every year."
The death toll of the return will depend on the extent of the decline and its variation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unexplained and affect people without symptoms.
The two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include a sore throat, a sore throat, a sore throat, a sore throat, shortness of breath, a sore throat, a sore throat, a sore throat, a sore throat, a sore throat, a sore throat, a sore throat, and a sore throat.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms: shortness of breath, frequent chest pain or pressure, sudden allergies, dizziness and numbness of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some of these infected people may be without symptoms, they can be referred to as confirmed patients without clinical symptoms test results, so the researchers have issued a recommendation that people who are in contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
China's undiagnosed disease ratio is estimated to range from a few numbers to 44 percent.
Usually the incubation period (intermediate time of infection and onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; it is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the sense of smell in people infected with COVID-19 was initially eradicated in 30% of people who later reduced to 15%.
The extent to which the disease is transmitted is still being studied in detail.
The disease is believed to initially develop due to close contact and from small droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking; where the distance in close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that droplets can range from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also spread through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods of time, which can cause respiratory droplets when exhaled, including during conversations, although the virus usually does not occur in the air.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of nearby people or possibly enter the pancreas when breathing.
Some medical practices, such as intravenous hose and artificial mouth-to-mouth breathing (CPR) can bring out respiratory fluids and so it can spread into the air.
It can also occur when an infected person touches the surface and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may come out of the mouth, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 through an emitted substance, which is highly contagious for up to three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is possible before the onset of symptoms and at the last stage of the disease.
Since people can get a positive test up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that the transmission of the disease is possible even before the appearance of effective symptoms.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported from the laboratory, where there are no symptoms of the disease, but in some countries, contacts have been detected without symptoms during the investigation.
The Centre for Europe's Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can usually infect two to three people - the virus can live for hours to days at different levels.
In particular, the virus was detected on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, up to a day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, this period varies in humidity and temperature and has been tested positive for COVID-19 in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as they do when contacting other surfaces that have been infected by an infected person.
The severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that has previously isolated itself from the three people who have contracted pneumonia in the city of Wuhan.
All characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related physical coronavirus - outside of the human body, the virus can be eliminated with gorilo soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the family of the beta-coronavirus (Numbers B), descended from two strains of chimpanzees in the feral lineage.
On the overall genome level, it is 96% similar to the other bat coronavirus specimen (BatCoV RTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid difference between human and penguin viruses in parts of the genome.
A complete genome comparison to date has shown that 92% of the genetic material is often combined with the Pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which are enough to prove that the Pangolin virus is the central host.
Temporary diagnosis of infection with the virus can be based on symptoms of the disease, although the infected fluid substance or ICT X-ray is eventually confirmed through reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan reported that CT is less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its characteristic properties are dominated by other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screening or as the first Mergeley test to diagnose COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is performed on the respiratory tract or blood sample.
Results are usually available for a few hours to a few days.
Usually, this test is done by the maker of anaphylaxis, although cotton can be used in the throat - a number of laboratories and companies have also developed cosmetic testing, which detects antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them have been able to be quite accurate enough to be approved for mass use.
In the United States, a serological test has been developed by Selex, which has been approved for emergency use only in authorized laboratories.
Characteristics of those depicted on their radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral ground glass optics and absent excess flow.
The Italian Radiology Society is creating an international online database of photo-results of certified events.
Due to overlap with other infections such as the adenovirus, the identification of the imaging of COVID-19 without PCR authentication is a limited feature.
A large study in China compared breast CT results with PCR, which showed that although the screening for infection is low-grade, it is faster and more sensitive, with the suggestion that it should be considered as a screening device in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based billed neural networks were created to detect the virus's distinct properties, both through radiography and CT.
Strategies for preventing the transmission of the disease include maintaining a holistic personal hygiene, washing hands, shaking eyes, nose or mouth with bare hands, and adding chins and chins and chins to the tissues.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a mask in public places.
Restrictions on travel are also recommended - many countries have restricted travel, or banned non-essential travel from other countries, or travel to regions that are affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading to the community in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some community members don't know how or where they have been affected -- people who are concerned about the spread of the disease are advised to seek additional treatments, so that they can be contacted and taken care of by the health authorities.
Concerns of privacy have been eased by governments using location data via mobile phones for this purpose, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for such surveillance to be restricted.
As of April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented or advised for voluntary use, more than a dozen groups are working on a privacy-friendly solution, such as using Bluetooth to get the user's location from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if he or she has been close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings are circulating regarding the prevention of infection; for example, pouring water into the nose and squeezing with a mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many companies are working on one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC often advises people to wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are apparently dry; before eating; and when someone cleans the nose, coughs, or coughs.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed with gorilla soap when its protective shell is removed.
The CDC recommends the use of additional alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with bare hands.
Surfaces should also be purified in a variety of ways (stainless steel surfaces should be kept for one minute in front of a disinfectant), including %62-71 ethanol, %50-100 isopropanol, %0.1 sodium hypochlorite, %0.5 hydrogen peroxide and 2% to 7.5 p.a.
Other methods, such as benzalkonium chloride and corhexedric gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or certified COVID case appears at a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas i.e. office, toilets, shared spaces, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, which are used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cough and sneeze and cover their mouths with a twisted elbow or tissue and immediately remove such tissue.
The recommendation to wear a surgical mask is for people who may be affected, because wearing a mask limits both the volume of droplets emitted by the infected person and the distance to go, when he or she speaks, coughs and coughs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how masks should be worn.
According to Stephen Griffin, an expert at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's chances of touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if washed without proper hand hygiene."
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a mask for healthy people only if their health is at serious risk, as they are treating people with COVID-19, even though they recognize that wearing a mask prevents people from touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of face masks made of cloth - China has specifically recommended that healthy people in the public use sanitary masks, especially when people are likely to go near (up to 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends using public transport or wearing a surgical mask while staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering the country without wearing a mask or shaking their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when entering shops.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a face mask when entering the country.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks in buses running between rail cars and cities from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask while going out of the house, while in homes, it is also recommended to make masks for people who are not able to buy masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes disease control measures aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These methods include the closure of quarantines, travel restrictions, schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing practices while staying at home, avoiding going to Hajj, not receiving blessings, and physically staying away from each other.
Many governments are imposing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (where there is no known case of COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people, which was later reduced to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Elderly people and those who are suffering from a disease such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, respiratory disease, and other diseases, such as chronic illnesses, "excessive exposure to global diseases, high blood pressure, and weakened immune systems," and the CDC advised them to avoid severe illnesses and complications.
With the term social distancing, people began to feel that they should be completely isolated from the world, rather than being encouraged to communicate with other people in alternative ways.
They also recommend that you only have sex with a person who does not have any symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who suspect they are infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation, and many governments have made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population living in an affected area go into self-quarantine.
The strictest guidelines for self-quarantine have been issued for people who are in serious danger groups.
People who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and have recently travelled to a country or region where there is widespread disruption have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible exposure.
Strategies in controlling a pandemic are prevention, control, or pressure and mitigation.
The containment strategy is developed in the early stages of the pandemic and the goal is to find and isolate the affected people, introduce other measures of infection control, and vaccinate to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from spreading further, the first stage of mitigation is initiated: measures are taken to reduce its spread and its impact on the health care system and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures should be put in place at the same time.
There is a need to take more stringent measures to curb the pandemic so that the pandemic can be brought back to a lower level than the primary outbreak. Part of the management of the infectious disease outbreak is to try to reduce the rise of the epidemic, which is called flattening the epidemic.
It reduces fears for health services that are being overwhelmed, and provides more time for vaccine preparations and treatments to be discovered.
Non-legal measures that can manage the spread of the pandemic include preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-cleaning measures such as isolation, isolation, and self-quarantine; social measures aimed at maintaining physical distancing, such as school closures and cancellation of community events, including community gatherings.
Other countries have taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has made mass screenings and quarantines locally and issued warnings on the movement of the affected people.
Singapore has provided financial assistance to the affected people who have quarantined themselves and those who have not done so have been fined.
The similarities between the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (decrease in the spread of the pandemic but not eliminating it) and pressure (increase in the global pandemic) are major challenges.
More and more mitigation policies can lead to a rise in health demand by up to two-thirds and a half, but at the same time, it can lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overtaken.
Pressure can be preferred as a transfer, but it should be continued as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if it is first available) otherwise it quickly returns to health when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the global pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including experiments on existing drugs.
The use of anti-cold medications, drinking more water and resting helps to alleviate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, it may be necessary to apply oxygen, get vaccinated in the vein, and take help to breathe.
The use of steroids can further worsen the results.
Many of the compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that "some traditional and gorilla tips" can help ease the spread of SARS-CoV-19 diseases.
The increase in the capacity and adaptation of health care providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key step in responding to the pandemic.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization's Regional European Union Office have issued guidance for resource transformation at various stages for hospitals and primary health centres, including to focus on laboratory services on the ability to test COVID-19, as well as the ability to quantify and disseminate information, when possible, through optional behavioral training, isolation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients.
There are many theories as to where the first event (the zero patient) would have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hobby began to increase gradually.
The majority of these cases come from the Hunan wholesale marine market, where live animals are sold, and there is a theory that the virus originated from this type of animal; in other words, the virus originated from the generation of diseases of animals.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Central Wuhan Hospital warned their colleagues about "SARS-like coronaviruses."
Among them, Dr. Lee Wenleague, was warned by the police about spreading false rumours and another one, Yifan, was rebuked by his superiors for spreading sarcasm.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission released a public report on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
By the end of January, Wuhan's health authorities had been informed of substantial cases of unnamed pneumonia to order an investigation, with the number of cases doubling almost every seven and a half days in the early stages of the pandemic.
In mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, with arrivals for the Chinese New Year playing an important role as Wuhan was a major source of transportation and rail interchange.

Central banks are responding more quickly than in the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the most affected skeptics due to travel restrictions, closure of public places, including tourist centers, and travel restrictions by governments globally.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline Flyby fell from the radar.
The marine tourism industry had never seen an impact before.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The pandemic came at a time when China's New Year's Eve was a major travel season in China.
Numerous events, which were to be attended by many more people, were canceled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year celebrations, in which celebrities also closed their shops and tourist centers, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar Year celebrations and tourist centers, including Forbidden City and traditional dome fairs in Beijing, were closed to avoid crowds.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipal and regional officials have extended New Year's Eve holidays until February 10, and have directed more workplaces not to reopen until this date.
The regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong has raised the response level of the infectious disease to the highest levels and declared a state of emergency, with schools closed until March and New Year's celebrations cancelled.
Access to retail stores in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retail sales in North America and the Middle East fell 50-60%.
This reduced the number of pedestrians to shopping centers by 33-43% in March compared to February.
The world's largest shopping mall operators implemented additional measures, such as additional cleaning, the installation of thermal scanners to test buyers' temperatures, and the cancellation of events. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the global poverty-stricken world is 22 million people in Latin America and another 14 million in Latin America due to the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic peaked in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China had lost their jobs.
Nearly 300 million people in China's rural provinces have either been displaced from their homes or died in Hubei province, leaving more than 10 million Americans jobless in March 2020 and applying for government assistance.
According to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the loss of coronavirus in the United States could be 47 million, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. In India, nearly 90,000 workers have lost their jobs due to the lockdown.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment stipends, and 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany welcomed their workers on a government-sponsored short-term work scheme called Courserbet.
The compensation scheme for Germany's short-term work has also been adopted by France and the UK.
At the global level, the arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has also had a significant impact on the individual people's actions of the institutions—both in terms of employment and autonomy.
Organizations in the field of arts and culture strive to maintain their missions (often with public support) to provide access to society, to protect their employees and people, and to help artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, artifacts, and other cultural institutions across the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and events were canceled or postponed.
In response, considerable efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and fastest failure of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, key events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Blessed Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian lit season, was canceled.
Many clergy advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday prayers; some churches began broadcasting church services on radio, live television, or online, while others were worshiping in the car, except for their sons.
As Roman Catholic clergy in Rome closed their churches and small churches and St. Peter's Square was emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and circuses.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic and the closure of shrines, while Saudi Arabia closed the entry of foreign visitors and closed the holy sites of Mecca and Medina as well.
This pandemic, since World War II, has caused a significant disruption to the world's sporting calendar.
Major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA, sessions, and 2019-20 NHL sessions, have been cancelled or postponed.
The spread has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the activity "will be scheduled for a rescheduled 2020 but will not be postponed or postponed after the summer of 2021.
Due to this, many gamblers have moved online, and the number of new signups of many online gambling sites has increased substantially. The entertainment industry has also been particularly affected, with many music groups deferring or rescheduling their concert visits.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many fans have found ways to work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as the Live Streaming event, and make it available to others, or continue to make web-based "mails" so that fans can perform, spread it, and advertise their work.
Online, many memes based on the idea of coronavirus have spread because many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, towards Chinese and East Asians, Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic has intensified, there has been a lot of prejudice, fear and racism from Xenophobia strangers.
Fears, doubts and opposition have emerged, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
According to reports in February (while most cases were limited to China), Chinese nationals have been subjected to racist sentiments across different groups around the world, which deserved the virus to be claimed in return.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also seen in some African countries.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei have reported the disparity that has been brewing with them on a regional basis.
For Chinese, both online and offline, and those in areas affected by the virus have been supported.
After the outbreak and spread to other countries, the people of Italy, Europe's first country where COVID-19 has spread, may be in fear of such doubts and strangers. Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese people from entering their own countries.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a trend on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US, have reported incidents of racism-based abuse and humiliation.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," critics have called the term racist and anti-China.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked the buses that were carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students coming from northern India, which borders China, and studying in major cities in India, had to suffer from the trauma associated with the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal, stated that China had "destroyed nature" and "that's why God has revenged them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese ambassador in Calcutta, calling it "misguided," as fear of foreigners in China has fueled feelings of racism from non-Chinese residents since the pandemic, calling foreigners "foreign waste" to be "placed."
Many paywall newspapers have removed them for coverage of some or all of their coronaviruses.
Publishers of many scientific materials made scientific papers related to this spread available to all.
Many scientists quickly sent their results to servers, such as bioRixiv, before publishing.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include procedures that detect the presence and presence of viruses that produce antibodies as a result of infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of the virus as samples, which detect the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibodies can also be used to diagnose and monitor populations.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those who had so few symptoms that they were too small or had no symptoms to report.
Based on the results of these tests, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity present in a population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of 2020, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 33% of its population, and there is also a lot of difference in how many tests have been conducted between countries.
There is a huge difference in the death rate due to this change, which is likely to be higher in some countries.
Tests on respiratory samples using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be obtained in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal fissures or bulk samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
The PT-PCR test is performed only in the first week of the disease.
Later, when its growth begins in the lungs, the virus disappears in the throat.
For those affected by the second week of testing, alternatively the sample material may be used by a suction catheter from deep airways or by coughing up material (wholesale).
The first PCR tests were developed in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at Cherty in Berlin, which became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" gene that is spread by the beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2. The BGI group in China was among the first companies in the 2019 coronavirus outbreak to be approved by the National Medical Product Administration of China (NCA) to prevent the use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.
One in three tests in the older version of the test kitten failed due to poor chemical interactions, and less than 100 samples were obtained in a single day in February 2020 due to the disruption of tests on the CDC in Atlanta.
As of February 28, 2020, two-component testing was not considered reliable, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization, with U.S. commercial laboratories starting testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has now made COVID-19 testing available across the country till 9 March 2020.
The quantitative limits have not been announced; the collection and further processing of samples must be in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was created and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology Vector.
As per the Mayo Clinic report on 12 March 2020, it has developed the test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for the test, which could be done in large numbers in 3.5 hours, i.e., one test in 24 hours, about 428 machines.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously given similar permission to Hologic, LabCorp, and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly obtained the EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, thanks to this method, positive results are achieved in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase the number of these machines to 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies that can be specifically limited to 20 minutes of the novel coronavirus' nucleocaped protein (N-protein), with the hope that they will be developed in Taiwan.
The final words of a review of the written content in March 2020 were, "There is no significance to the radiography of the chest at the initial destination, but the presence of CT-computed tomography is possible before symptoms appear."
The general properties of CT are two-sided multi-lobar-bound glass faded pins, which cover the dispersion and the splitting of the back.
It grows as the disease grows, complete dominance, madness, and stability develops.
Wuhan, where the pandemic originated, suggested a comparison between PCR and CT in a demand that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its features similar to the stages of pneumonia and disease.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as the first priority for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
Immunity to infections, including IgM and IgG, is the development of partial response antibodies.
They can be used to detect infections in people who have had symptoms for 7 days, to determine immunity, and for people who are under close supervision, to be tested at the Central Laboratories (CLT) or the Centre for Safety Testing (PoCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to produce high-quality automated systems for these tests, but their availability will be halted at the rate of production for each system.
For CLT, a single sample of blood is usually used, although many samples can be used to detect resistance.
For POCT, a sample of blood is usually obtained by rinsing on the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notifications to the agency and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
Only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization until April 7, 2020, and at the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can be applied to blood samples of IgG and IgA antibodies.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than traditional PCR for the detection of RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection, and in early April the UK found that none of the purchased test kits were sufficiently accurate for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that will allow suspected patients to stay at home, "emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient," he will go to the hospital to get tested for COVID-19, he will send it back to the hospital to get the results.
The National Association of State Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that it has the capacity to conduct 12,000 tests per day in general settings and 10,700 tests last week.
When it comes to health insurance, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several major cities.
The number of tests conducted in Germany as of March 26, 2020 is not known, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, 483,295 samples were tested as of week 12/2020 and this week, samples were tested at week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples were tested at <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (%6.9) per month, positive for 2-SARS-CoV.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
Wuhan laboratory procedures were immediately adopted by Huo-Yan Laboratories located in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus totalling 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, there were 50,000 tests per day.Origami Tests have released open-source multi-anasir designs that can test 1122 COVID-19 patients with only 93 attempts.
As of March, shortages and inadequate reagents have become a barrier to mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
As a result, some authors have investigated protocols for the preparation of samples that allow samples to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to emit RNA genomes or chromosomes for further testing.
Such a draw-through capability and benefit from both the GROUP 42 and BGI (based on their China-based emergency detection labs "HUO-Yan") developed for large populations.
Established in 14 days, the lab conducted 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to operate on such a large scale apart from China.
Various testing techniques have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German structure for low-income countries, which do not have the resources to make cuts.
The German synthesis was published on January 17, 2020, and the protocols made in the United States to control the disease were not available until January 28, which led to concerns about the quality of the test kits in China and the United States in the early days of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide the kits despite recommendations and demands from health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that the spread of the novel coronavirus has decreased due to the large supply of South Korea's testing.
The South Korean government has boosted testing capacity in private-sector laboratories in recent years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for strengthening testing programs to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high spread of the virus led to an increase in testing demand and tens of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories were halted, and the supply of wound-cleaning sewage and chemical interactions was strained.
In March 2020, China reported the issue of the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC cuts had "points", the government then removed office barriers that led to private testing. Spain bought the cuts from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the wrong results is the failure to properly use the cuts or cuts in collecting the samples.
Spain's ministry said that the wrong resulting kits would be removed and replaced with the testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy, with 80% of the tests purchased from China by the state check giving the wrong results.
Attskara, the Turkish health ministry, said the cuts that Turkey bought from China were "very high" and were "not used."The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
If the test results are positive, the quarantined individuals and those who were in contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 have shown good results.
In the Italian town of Vo, where Italy's first Covid-19 death occurred, working researchers from the entire population, which consisted of about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
About half of the people who were tested had no symptoms, and all the detected cases were quarantined.
Restricting travel to specific human groups completely eliminated new infection cases.
Due to a thorough investigation of contacts with the affected people, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has had far less impact on Singapore than the world's developed countries, where there were no strict restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been disrupted, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay confined to their homes from March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries have also been able to overcome the pandemic through stringent measures such as detection, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but did not do much of the hardest lockdowns, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have tested higher, mortality rates, have a lower mortality rate, perhaps because these countries have been able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
The WHO has recommended that countries that do not have the ability to test and national laboratories to deal with COVID-19, send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to WHO's 16 referencing laboratories for testing.
Of these 16 referencing labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "% of positive tests" is related to a country's testing policy.
The country that only tests those admitted to the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests than the country that tests all of its citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, will take all of them equally.
Hand washing (or hand washing) is also known as hand hygiene, the purpose of this procedure is to clean your hands with clay, lubricants, germs, or other non-essential materials.
On some "essential occasions" frequent hand washing with soap a day prevents many diseases from spreading, for example diarrhoea and haemorrhoids enter the mouth pathways.
People can also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucus burns).
There are five essential occasions in a day when washing hands with soap is very important: before and after going to the toilet, after the baby's bottom cleansing or diaper replacement, before feeding the baby, before feeding and after preparing food, or after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can also be cleaned with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after a patient's illness.
After the baby's diaper is changed or the baby's toilet is cleaned.
After cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching the animal, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hygiene means that the medical procedure must be in accordance with the principles of hygiene.
Washing hands or taking medical care before eating the medicine can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or spread disease.
This is especially true for people who are in the food or medical field, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections in the system;
There is a decrease in the number of children born at home.
A 2013 study showed that hand washing improves a little bit in infants under the age of five.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce infant mortality due to respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce deaths due to these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce the mortality rate by one-third from diarrheal events, and can be compared with the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap can reduce the mortality rate by up to 48%. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and severe respiratory infections (ARI). It is an automated procedure that can be performed in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to the UNICEF, changing the habit of washing hands before and after meals can save more lives than using a vaccine or medical intervention, which is a half-reduction in deaths due to diarrhoea and a quarter reduction in deaths due to respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually part of other items of health and hygiene, i.e., water, sewage, and sanitation programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against infections that are transmitted directly from the joints.
A small loss of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by drying out the skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can cause skin irritation, known as clenbuterol or skin inflammation, and is commonly found in people in the medical field.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a sign of over-hypertension (OCD).
There are five critical occasions in a day when washing hands with soap is very important to reduce the spread of disease through the mouth: after using the bathroom (pigmentation or faucet), after washing the bottom of the baby (dip change), before feeding the baby, before and after feeding the baby, before and after feeding the fish, before and after eating the meat, or after preparing the meat.
Other occasions when properly washing hands in order to prevent the transmission of disease include: before and after handling the wound; after sneezing, coughing or cleaning the nose; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after handling the rubbish.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing is low.
According to a 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. According to a 2014 study, this is the highest rate in Saudi Arabia, i.e. 97 percent of households, i.e. in the United States, i.e. 77 percent of households, i.e. in the middle, i.e. in China, the rate of growth is the lowest, i.e. 23% of children.
The mandatory "health protection program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the widespread promotion of children's health and education.
This national program includes brushing your teeth twice a year, as well as washing your hands daily with soap, and brushing your teeth daily from Florida.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The process of quickly removing germs has improved by adding soap and detergents in water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to dissolve and increase the solution.
Water alone is not enough to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are part of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning, however, is done with the help of proper flow of water.
In solid soap, due to re-use, bacteria may be present due to past use.
A few studies that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid-polluted soaps say that this transition cannot happen because the bacteria goes away with the foam.
The CDC still says that "liquid soap is preferable without hand control."
Antibacterial soaps have been greatly promoted in the health conscious public.
There is no evidence yet that the use of recommended sterile drugs creates antibiotic-resistant organic organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps have such common antibacterial adjectives, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic organisms.
So if antibacterial soaps don't choose antibiotic-resistant, they won't be as effective as they've been said about them.
In addition to diuretic substances and skin preservatives, more phosphate-formed compounds can contain ph-regulators, enzyme-active benzoic acids (as acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), and skin conditioners (Aloe Vera, Vitamin, Mental, Potassium).
The hot water in which the hands are comfortable is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, semi-heated, soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils, which absorb soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies say that semi-heated water is not effective in reducing germs by hand.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, the use of non-water-based handwashing (also known as alcohol-based handwashing, sterile handwashing or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that has been mixed into a concentrated compound, such as carbomer (multi-molecular mixture of multiacrylic acid) into a gel-like substance or in a tuberculous substance, such as glycerin, to make fluids or to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding oxide to the dissolved hydrogen increases anti-microbial activity. Hand sanitizers with alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective disinfectants.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccinia, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol (a reduction of 3.5 logs, equivalent to 35 decibels) kill the bacteria 30 seconds after use and kill the bacteria from 99.97 percent to 99.999 percent after 1 minute of use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for the Norovirus or Norwalk, which is the most common cause of small intestine inflammatory disease.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and final parts of all fingers should be moistened for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam or gel is dry.
Fingertips should also be washed thoroughly and rub them on the palms of both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with sanitizer, especially when hands are exposed to contamination.
The reason for the rapid use of such materials is their ease of use and the ability to kill germs quickly; however, they should not be considered an alternative to formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizers can dry out quickly, unless creams and/or skin-wetting items are included in the formula.
Glycerin and/or other creams can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experiments have shown that the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, including creams, reduces skin irritation and dryness, compared to soap or anti-microbial detergents.
In the case of various arrhythmias or excessive sensitivity to alcohol, or the inclusion of alcoholic beverages, there may be occasional allergies.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, it tends to be less prone to irritating diseases.
Despite their effectiveness, non-waterborne organisms are not able to clean up organic matter, they are only sterilizing them.
That's why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many germs, because germs are on hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is largely dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically they have not been very effective.
Among the structures in which benzoyl conium chloride has been used in recent days, unlike alcohol, there has been an overall anti-microbial activity after use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to the reaction in the skin, its performance has decreased.
In many low-income societies, people do not buy soap and use ashes or clay instead.
Ashes and soil may be more effective than water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if the soil or ash is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ashes are an amalgam of germs as it forms an alkaline solution after mixing with water.
WHO recommends ashes or soil in case of not being soapy.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the correct hand washing procedure, to prevent the spread of the disease, consists of the following:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
A lot of water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, while the water temperature does not matter.
Rub the hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle spaces of the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Soap removes germs quickly, and research has shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Wait for at least 20 seconds.
Mixing creates friction, which helps to quickly remove germs, and removes more germs than rubbing for a longer period of time.
Wash well with plenty of water.
Washing hands in the basin can lead to contamination again.
Clean it with a dry towel or allow the air to dry.
Wet and moist hands can be easily re-infected. Commonly leftover parts include the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers, and the sides of the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-nail polishes can be a combination of germs.
Moisture lotions are usually recommended to protect hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided, such as a hanging canister or a luxurious vegetable with proper holes, to pour water from the well and/or use ashes in developing countries, such as in developing countries, where water supply is low (e.g. in schools or in developing countries).
The tippy-tap is a simple technology with a jig hanging from a rope, and a lever moving from the feet, with a little water pouring on a tray of hands and soap.
Efficient hand drying is part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about what is the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric drawers, which are often found in cleanrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a research, sponsored by the paper towel manufacturing industry, the European tissue symposium, which included paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet air heaters to offer hygiene levels.
After washing hands and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the rate of bacteria on finger mattresses increased by an average of 194% and 254% on handhelds.
Drying from the jet air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in the rate of bacteria on the finger mattress and 15% on the palms.
After washing hands and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on finger pads was reduced by an average of 76% and on palms by 77%.
Jet Air Dryer, which emits air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing out the germs from the hands and unit, and can pollute the other uses of the purifier and the purifier's environment at a distance of 2 meters.
The hot air can spread the hand dryer to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, a study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt examined the different methods of hand drying.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many hand drying manufacturers of different dryers, and the dryers have been compared to paper towels.
During travel, hand washing with sanitized paper is an alternative in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medically handwashing was mandated by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis after discovering its effectiveness in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electrical appliances that provide the hospital staff with feedbacks to remind them to wash their hands when they forget.
According to a study, their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medically washing the hand is for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water or gel in a special amount to make the foam and rub every part of the hand.
The fingers of the hands should be tied to each other.
If there is mileage in the finger nails, a hard-to-hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them well with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and, if necessary, to open the back door).
This will cause the hands to not be contaminated again after they are applied to these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("insects") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine report, hand washing rates are also incredibly low in the medical environment, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients in routine, thus becoming a means of transmitting germs.
According to a study, washing the right hands and other simple methods reduces the rate of urinary tract infections by up to 66 percent, the World Health Organization has published a paper showing the right way to wash hands and get hands in the health sector.
The Draft Guide to Hand Cleaning can be viewed on their website for public comments.
A related review was made by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can check and verify the hand hygiene, if it is required to do so.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says there are five ways to wash your hands.
In the case of blood/body
prior to the outbreak of the disease, and
After taking care of the patient. The addition of germicidal chemicals in the soap ("medicated or "antimicrobial" soap) to the germicidal kill function is found in the hand washing amulet.
There is a requirement of disinfection where there is a lot of antibiotic-resistant organisms before or after surgery. For operation, it is necessary to "rubber" your hands with a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching the hand, cleaned with chlorhexidine or iodine, cleaned with iodine, cleaned with sterile to dry after washing the hand.
All ornaments should be removed.
The procedure involves washing the hands from the wrist to the elbows, usually 6-2 minutes.
Long-lasting friction (10 minutes) is not required.
When water is being poured on the middle of the arm, make sure that it does not return to the hands.
When the washing of hands is complete, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after seeing the patient or apply sterile materials to the hands.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has found that the highest benefits of hand hygiene came from the first 20% wash, and that when the rate was increased by 35%, there was little additional benefit.
The use of simple soap was three times more effective than antibacterial soap in the context of bacterial infectious disease transmission in the diet. Alcohol-based solvents and antibacterial soaps compared to hand friction every 30 seconds.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solutions to remove H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficult spores by hand. If the hand hygiene and cleanliness of the hands are improved, it will require staff training for hand washing, alcohol-based handwashing.
More research is needed in this regard to see what kind of measures are more effective in a variety of health settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered a means of low cost, good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of constant supply of water, soap and handwashing facilities at people's homes, schools and workplaces poses a major challenge for all to adopt the global handwashing habit.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is very rare to have a hand-washing faucet near a private or public toilet, although many low-cost forms of hand-washing are possible.
However, the reduction in the rate of hand washing may also be due to the maturity of the habit, rather than the lack of soap and water.
The stimulus and advertising of hand washing with soap can affect decision-making, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and create far-reaching changes in the behavior of the population.
Monitoring and testing are necessary to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that LMICs are more effective at working in a particular community, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One of the methods of hand washing in schools is "three-star approach" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple steps to ensure their own health.
When the minimum standards are reached, the schools can reach the second and then the third stars.
Creating hand washing spaces can be part of a hand washing campaign, aimed at reducing diseases and deaths in children.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a promotional series of warnings aimed at behavioral change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of handwashing emojis.
Some research has found that hand washing as a whole is less costly by ignoring DALYs in developing countries.
However, according to one review, it is more cost-effective to promote hand washing with soap, compared to water and its drainage management.
The importance of washing hands for human health - especially for those in unsafe conditions, such as mothers who have just given birth or hospitalized soldiers - was first recognized by the two first-of-its-kind hygienists in the mid-19th century.
At the time, most people still believed that the cause of the infection was odor.
In 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promoted hand hygiene more intensively as a key means of preventing the spread of infection due to foodborne illnesses and public health infections.
The swine flu in 2009 and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 promoted awareness in many countries that washing hands with soap is essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung at hand washing places outside public toilets, in the toilets of office buildings and at the airport in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" means a person who declares not to take responsibility for anything or not to say anything.
This is related to the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate expressed his disapproval of Jesus' decision to be crucified, but it later became a proverb in English-speaking societies.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth finds herself forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, revealing the mystery of the murder of her husband.
It has also been revealed that people tend to wash their hands more often than others, after recalling or considering an immoral act, and that hand washing is very important.
Furthermore, people who wash their hands after such thoughts are less involved in other "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
The use of soapy water without washing hands is characteristic of many religions: such as Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Judaism, Tuila, Natilat Yadam, Lavabo Aisaat, and Dhu'l-Islam.
Hand washing is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam after the use of toilets.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Risks in the Workplace for COVID-19
Controlling workplace hazards for COVID-19 refers to implementing occupational safety and health measures to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of workplace hazards depends on the nature of the workplace and the nature of work, the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and among workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure hazard jobs are those that have minimal professional contact with the public and other partners, suggesting basic measures to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and maintaining a clean work environment.
Mid-exposure jobs are those that are in contact with people who are not aware of COVID-19, but may be affected by social transfers and international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, the work environment in densely populated areas, and more retail spaces.
In addition to the basic safety measures to prevent infection for this knot, there are high-performance air filters for air traffic control, sneezing protection, and personal protective equipment, if an infected person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA considers the appearance of health care and dead-house workers in front of a person infected or suspected of COVID-19 to be at high risk, much higher exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect or maintain samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Proper measures should be taken to control the risk for these workers, such as negative pressure chambers of air traffic, and personal protective equipment depending on the nature of the work.
There are many possible effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace.
In view of the risk of getting sick, workers may be unprepared for the safety of others, or for the fear of being exposed to the disease.
Trade procedures may change, depending on the demand for goods and the acquisition of these goods (such as purchases, or delivery or draw-through facilities in low-altitude times).
Finally, there may be a disruption in the delivery of goods from areas severely affected by COVID-19, and a plan to prepare and respond to the infectious disease can be used to guide precautionary measures.
Projects identify risk levels associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community setting, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the methods of these controls and emergency plans for emergencies resulting from the outbreak, which are necessary to deal with these risks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be the subject of national or regional proposals.
Reducing the transition between staff in response to an epidemic, protecting those at risk due to poor health complications, and mitigating the adverse impacts on business activities and supplies.
The community in which the business is located affects the response to the severity of the disease.
The risk-control classification framework is very effective in occupational safety and health, so as to effectively control group risks.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are set up, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
The controls are designed to isolate employees from work-related risks, without relying on their behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to the application.
Administrative control refers to a change in the work policy and procedure, which requires action from the worker or owner.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but can help prevent some appearance.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the hazards posed to workers, installed properly, if applicable (e.g., a balancing device), worn continuously and properly, maintained and replaced, whichever is necessary, if properly removed, cleaned and stored or avoided pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposed hazard jobs are in minimal professional contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic measures to prevent infection in all workplaces that are recommended include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing and sneezing routines, including coughing and sneezing, face coverings, tissues and sneezing, phone conversations, or, if necessary, frequent hand washing.
The identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a worrying step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms stay at home until they are exposed to fever, fever symptoms, or any other symptoms, and that employees with at least 24 hours of fever or other symptoms end up without the use of medications to alleviate the illness.
According to the OSHA, mid-exposure hazards are jobs that require close or constant contact from a distance of six feet (1.8 meters) from people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by community transmission around the business, or because of the COVID-19 outbreak where the individual has a recent large international travel.
This includes the workers who are in contact with the public, such as the schools, the working environment in the densely populated areas and the number of people who are in contact with COVID-19, who are in contact with COVID-19, who are in contact with COVID-19, who are in contact with COVID-19, who are in contact with COVID-19, who are in contact with COVID-19, who are in contact with COVID-19, and who are in contact with COVID-19.
In this group of workers, the use of respiratory devices is rare.
If a person falls ill in an airplane, proper control means to protect workers and other passengers, to keep the sick person isolated for a distance of 6 feet from others, to allocate a staff member to the patient, and to present a face mask to the sick person, or to tell the patient to cover his mouth and hands with tissue by coughing or sneezing.
When approaching a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, the ship's crew must wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment, if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in bags made for this purpose, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk control includes the suspension of travel on a ship in the event of a disease, and the suspension of travel on an express and express vessel.
The CDC recommends a short-term closure for schools and children's care centers if an infected person has come into the school building, even if he has not spread the virus, to be cleaned or disinfected.
When there is a small to medium spread of the virus, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings, such as physical education or music classes, or canceling meals at cafeterias for children, extending the distance between desks, visiting arrivals and departure times.
When there is a substantial shift in the local community, long-term closures of schools can be considered in addition to a social distancing strategy. Law enforcement personnel who are performing their daily activities, according to the CDC, are perceived as less of an immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers, who have to contact people with COVID-19 with certainty or suspicion, are recommended to follow the same guidelines as those for emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during panic, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning sprays or wipes before re-use, and follow the standard implementation procedure to use and disinfect the PPE used and contain and wash clothes.
According to the OSHA, some health centers and dead homes are at greater or greater risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become much more revealing risky when workers take aerosol-forming action, or collect or manage samples of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the aerosol-making process, insertion of grooves, cough-related procedures, examination of throat veins, some dental-related carvings and inspections, or collection of nasty samples.
High-risk jobs in the morgue include workers who develop dead bodies of people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional configurations controlled, including rooms isolated for known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
In some health centers and dead rooms, special negative-pressure air flow devices may be appropriate.
Samples should be touched under the safety measures of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be quarantined in specific waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected of COVID-19 cases.In addition to other PPE, the OSHA recommends device respirators for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from a known patient or a suspected member of SARS-CoV-2, and those who operate aerosols.
In light of a comprehensive and written safety respiratory program in the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtration devices should be used with respirators or better, including appropriate testing, training, and clinical testing.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide better protection and improve worker comfort The WHO does not recommend completely covering, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks in place of the entry screen for the crew.
People who are collecting respiratory samples, taking care of or transferring COVID-19 patients without an aerosol manufacturing procedure, the WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or shields, gowns, and stains for the face.
If the aerosol-making method is performed, replace surgical masks with N95 or FFP2 devices.
Knowing that the global delivery of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, only allowing them to enter the room that is directly taking care of a COVID-19 patient, the use of PPE is necessary for specific tasks, the use of PPE is necessary for the treatment of many patients suffering from the same disease, the use of the same device without any respiratory and monitoring, the use of PPE without any symptoms, the use of the disease.

Subject: [Covid-19] Weight Loss and Preparing for the Future
Sending date/time: March 14, 2020, 00:24UTC
CC0: No rights reserved.
This month we are having some strange events.
The COVID-19 pandemic is one that has made it clear that humans are universally connected and that we have responsibilities to each other.
We have no previous example of such a challenge, but we are well aware that our best response is the global sense of co-operation, and social construction that is the spirit of this institution.
The feelings of friendship and attention that we've seen in emails, phone calls, and chats in all of our co-workers are a confirmation of how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud that you are all my co-workers.
Last week, someone complimented me on my work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to return to Wikipedia now, and how strong it is for this delicate resource to be available online for all.
Your work has made it possible, whether you're with the Sites or our customers who make payments or our community is safe.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes from this coming week on how we work together.
Changes in our work and schedule.
As Robyn previously expressed, the c-team had a meeting last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we discussed what would be the most appropriate response to what we are facing and how to keep the organization on its feet at the time.
We wanted to end the tension for a long time and promote our mission.
If you want to dial.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our day-to-day work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until the order is renewed,
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work according to the usual hours, the mission can get you used to it.
However, nothing can be said about the world at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy deals, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
We don't need to say that, but we are saying it.
There is no need for disease days or PTOs - just tell your manager and help your team to renew their calendars and schedules, ensuring that all aspects of the work are completed.
(If you get a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, notify Bryan within T&C Ops, T&C can help with support and make sure the administration pays proper attention to your situation).
Full-time employees will be paid.
We've said it before, and we're reiterating our commitments to our contractors and staff who work on time.
Each person will be paid according to the hours they meet during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people work in the world around them to change their mental state.
What we can do is incredibly rewarding, especially in days like these.
Again, this is all for your personal safety.
All we have to say is that you talk to your manager, this will give us an idea of what to expect from you and then set things accordingly.
No work is considered necessary.
There are things we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (other than others) work hard, which may require additional support.
We examine recent objectives with all areas and support what is needed for our mission, change our focus.
We all have a lot to do, we will only focus our attention on all the very important projects.
Slowing down at this time won't hurt us later.
We don't plan on "who will do what" once this pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work extra time to meet deadlines, which is currently unrealistic.
We recognize that things have changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and timelines.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
In order to set our new reality and expectations for daily working hours, we aim to plan our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We want to expand our 2019-2020 plan, which takes more time to create a budget where workers will be allowed to change their work preferences, and look at their loved ones in a position to accommodate those in need who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the work and pressure of the existing planning throughout the organization.
We will introduce our plan to the board next week and inform the delegations and teams about the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for leading the AP team in this.
Office Status, Appearance and Cleaning
Last week, we heard that one of our SF-based friends may be infected with COVID-19.
However, despite a lot of caution, we also put in place an anti-virus program in the San Francisco office to clean up all surfaces.
He used a hospital-level disinfectant solution to clean the arms of the brahmanas and the ladders at every level through which we have access to our care.
The building is also using its own protocol products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be in a state of readiness as soon as we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has partnered with all DC office staff members and our own COVID-19 protocols.
Last week, our DC office moved to a remote location in accordance with the San Francisco Joint Directory.
As some of our NYC residents know, we're also hiring a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
We know that this is an old-fashioned way of thinking, and we want to give you some advice.
The duration of the meetings can be extended to one or two hours.
If you need long seats, consider how to divide them on different days.
Clarify the meeting as an agenda, and send the content to the reader first.
Default the video, with facilities such as Google Docs and Zoom for direct support and communication.
Take precedence in providing support for each meeting, one should monitor the discussion for questions, and follow the list of speakers, and one should help to take a note (or a note in collaboration).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to technical support.
Make use of your money to pay for the sinks.
Join the <0x23>remotes channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about split work.
The HR implementation team is considering the webinar-based aerodynamics guidance to support the distributor across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of social incentives to cancel Wikimedia's privileged public events, such as Edith's, until the World Health Organization announced the end of the pandemic.
They should know that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions may make it possible to complete their accepted cooperation activities and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down these goals.
In the coming weeks, we will follow additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic social conferences.
The general feeling of the entire international community is sad about the disruption, but their own communities are satisfied with their clear ability to focus on the wiki media.
Growing up, CRT is working on creating a web page on MetaWiki to provide the community with the opportunity to follow their communication and monitor their impact.
Stay in touch with COVID-19-related issues.
We will also send you an invitation for a special meeting on Thursday 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share the latest information, answer your questions, and spend some time getting in touch with each other.
We are here to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information from this email and other essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office wiki.
The CRT will keep the latest and all other information on this page in one place.
We are working to maintain regular contacts with staff members who are currently living in countries that are heavily affected.
If you have a travel, events, an important job, a coverage challenge, or anything you need help with, please do not hesitate to work with the CRT and receive notifications.
We are here to provide support and support.
If you have a secret or sensitive matter, please email Brian Jordan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as relinquishing our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition at this point, our work and responsibilities will need to be lurking in a way that we have never seen in the past.
These are the steps that we feel it is important to support each other so that we can continue to work, support our movement and serve the world they depend on.
When the time comes, our work will be there.
Now, helping each other is a time-consuming task and taking advantage of the opportunity to do important work that will come in a few weeks, but possibly in a few months.
We need all of you to do this, and that is why it is important for all of you to take care of yourself and your family so that you are ready to be in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please, don't put your hands up and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J. Dorian D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L, Lynt L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership of the team (Grant I, Header W), Jim V, Gen Yu, Lisa S, Ryan A, and Toby M.
B-Ingeotensin - enzyme 2 convertor (ACE2) is an enzyme that is linked to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 makes it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease by reducing the amount of angiotensin II of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and increasing the amount of angiotensin II (1-7). ACE2 also serves as the entry point for some coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of enzyme that contains methylensium, which is found on the endothelial surface and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N terminal peptidase M2 domain and a Cterminal Cholesterol renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I protein, whose enzyme-active domain is present on the surface of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
The domain outside the cells of ACE2 is categorized from the trans-membrane domain by another enzyme called the shrews, and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream which is eventually excreted out through the urine.
ACE2 is found in most of the organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with lung type II skeletal cells, small intestinal intravenous intravenous, arterial and ventral intracellular cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
The impression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the brain's outer jaw, body contour, lower torso from the little finger, to the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance of ACE.
The ACE injects the hormone I into the blood clots of the injector.
In turn, the ACE2 carboxyl terminal separates the amino acid phenylalanine from the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and converts the hydrolytes to vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-O-H-Arg-Val).
ACE2 can also distinguish a number of other peptides, including [Des-Org 9]-Bredecine, Appellin, Neurotensin, Denorphine A, and Ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the movement of the membranes of the SLC6A19 carrying natural amino acids and is involved in mental disorders of the brain.
As a protein trans-inflammatory, ACE2 acts as the central entry point to the cells of a few coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the restriction of the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2's spike S1 protein cells leads to the enzyme content of a cell's enzyme to swallow inwards and move within both viruses and enzyme cells.
The intervention process also requires the introduction of spermatozoa by the representative serene protein TMPRSS2, which continues as a potential treatment under current research. This has led some to conclude that a decrease in the level of ACE2 in cells, may be easier to combat the disease.
However, a number of professional societies and organizations have advised not to continue with normal ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE contraceptives was associated with a 34% reduction in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, has also been reduced.
ACE strains are also linked to a decrease in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human transplantation ACE2 (rhACE2) is referred to as a modern treatment for severe lung injury, and it appeared that a lipolysaccharide will improve the supply of hemodynamics and oxygen with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and in addition to the 24-hour effect, action begins in 30 minutes.
Several results suggest that rhACE2 may be a better medicine for people with classical renin-injection system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where the circulation of angiotensin II is high-risk rhACE2 amylose has been diagnosed during clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile applications that help communicate during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example the process of identifying people ("connections") who have been in contact with an infected person.
A number of such applications have been created or proposed in several regions and circles in collaboration with the government.
A number of application frameworks have been developed to find communication.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about the system that uses the app to find the geographical location of the user.
Low-interference alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals so that the user's location and location can be transferred to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will collaborate to integrate this type of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has created an app that allows citizens to find out if they were in contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. The TraceTogether app is being used in Singapore.
The app was created by a local IT community, which was released as an independent source and will be referred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" that can detect the proximity of potentially infected people and respond immediately to health care authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Information Technology and Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-searching app is in the next stage of preparation and will be available for launch within a week--there are plans for this type of application ("Stop Covid") in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering developing applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and Blootris protocols - Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19-positive patients based in Moscow to ensure that people don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, put forward a number of potential practical challenges in app-based systems, including the possibility of false positive outcomes and low effectiveness, if the application was limited to a small segment of the population.
While skewing concerns about the spread of the false or harmful "coronavirus" app, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related applications to their App Store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Confidentiality experts have expressed their concerns about the endless restrictions on surveillance on the coronavirus app, especially whether surveillance arrangements set up to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed after the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement asking to limit this type of surveillance arrangements.
The following are the conditions set by the government on the projects:
The monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and monitoring should be extended for a certain period of time:
The use of the data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data protection and anonymity will be protected and evidence-based protection must be disclosed;
Digital surveillance must be avoided to make it more discriminatory and irrelevant;
The sharing of data with a third party must be made clear under the law;
Protective measures will have to be taken against abuses, and citizens will have the right to respond to abuses;
Significant participation from all "relevant partners" will be required, including public health experts and non-critical groups, including the German Caves Computer Club (CCC) and the non-border correspondent (Reporter Ohn Greenzhen) (RSF) also released surveillance lists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan is to solve the problem of permanent monitoring by eliminating the monitoring mechanism from its operating system device, when it is no longer needed.
Some countries used a network-based location monitoring system instead of the app, which eliminates both the need to download the application and the ability to avoid monitoring.
A network-based monitoring system was adopted in Israel.
Network-based solutions, including those that have access to chance palace's malicious data, have the potential to lead to significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems integrated with central servers require access to personal occasion palace data; several systems of privacy protection have also been designed that use only central servers to communicate with each other (see the section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using an excellent application, the system collects monitoring information from a variety of sources, including the transfer of monitoring data and data from the card to the mobile device, and collects all of them and creates notices through text messages for potentially affected people.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the location information publicly available to alert potential contacts, something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes in the privacy laws of the information when the MERS epidemic broke out in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries like Germany have considered both central and privacy protection systems.
Details have not been released as of April 6, 2020.
As of now, as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth's Weak Energy (BLE) that allow the user to access the site from another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that consists of both central and non-central methods, and is not a single protocol. In non-central protocols: non-central privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, FKA Event Contact Numbers, CEN, etc.)
In these protocols, identifiable personal data is not excluded from the device and all corresponds to each other.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Laboratory is developing secure routes, a platform to use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research carried out by the advent of "Epson Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic," a similar initiative launched in March 2020 by Engma MPC, the SafeTrace platform, a privacy technology company that was originally established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and contractors, without compromising on the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by a group of people who had the same vision and broadly exceeded protocols to reduce the spread of Shiraz so as to enable surveillance and alert apps globally as a mutually beneficial component of mass adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the application, the Blootrise application, which was used by his government, was made free.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile platform control companies, Google and Apple, announced a move to track communications, which, according to their claim, will protect privacy, based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and security privacy.
He also published the specifics of the actual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three phases:
The implementation of these protocols will enable governments to launch official security privacy applications for the detection of coronavirus.
Google and Apple intend to solve this permanent monitoring problem through the direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android in such a way that the system is first distributed through operating system updates, and later removed in the same way when the threat is removed.
Changing the medication (also known as changing the purpose of the drug, re-profiling, changing the job, or changing the treatment) is to change or use the medical condition of another drug approved for the treatment of a disease rather than to use it for the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is an online scientific research that is currently underway to research for an effective and safe treatment of COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the production of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of rubellat plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 potential drug proteins, each of which has multiple pathogens.

It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/retinavir (Celtra), a compound of antiviral lopinavir and retinavir, has come to the conclusion that it "has not seen any benefit".
These drugs were designed in such a way as to prevent HIV from being replicated by binding proteins.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado are trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.The scientific community has been criticized for turning the resources back to re-producing drugs, especially drugs developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retinavir in the international harmonization trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Glad Science to prevent Ebola virus disease and promote the treatment of Marburg virus diseases--the subsequent Glad Science immediately discovered that there are several active antiviral activities in the liver within Remdesivir, such as femo, paramexo, and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the proliferation of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several such clinical trials, including those administered by two Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with low-cardiovascular disease and the other for people with severe illness.
There are three clinical trials for critically ill COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized with vitamin C in the vein; two for satisfaction control (China, Canada) and one for uncontrolled (Italy).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a fake vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such vaccines.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five candidates for the vaccine were in the Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, there was a major pandemic in the world, which led to substantial investment and research activities in the production of a vaccine.
Several agencies are using advertised loonies to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CEP's measures to develop the vaccine are fast, enabling the capacity of the manufacturers, deployment at a large scale and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I safety studies include a number of major platform goals:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Canon Sino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 are certified as active projects (79, according to the Melkin Institute), and 37 others have announced but little public information about them (it is believed that they are in the planning stage or are now in the design phase).
Phase I-II experiments test the initial safety and immunity rate, usually without a sequence, controlled by the harmless substance of the drug, and at multiple sites, while determining more specific, effective doses.
Phase III experiments typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention, while monitoring the side effects on maximum doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active preparation (actually certified as early as April 2020), 74 were yet to be diagnosed in humans (so far in "pre-medical" research).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamping vaccine that could trigger an immune response by genetically altering viral proteins.

At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a $275 million Canadian funding for 96 research projects on COVID-19 response medical issues, including multiple vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan's initiatives.
Nearly at the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine, with several of the new vaccines planned to establish a national "vaccine bank" that will be used when a second outbreak of the coronavirus occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Peters Bridge School of Medicine University reported experiments on Petkovic, which could be a potential COVID-19 virus in mice, saying that "MNA showed strong antigen-related antibody reactions by the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine.
On April 16, 2020, in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans to design a DNA-based vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate the harmless virus-like particles inside human bacteria, which strengthens the immune system of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, which will be combined with Heliot Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have different effects, also known as nonspecific effects.
This means that they can also have other benefits apart from the disease they want to avoid.
4,170 medical examiners are also being enrolled for another randomized trial in Australia.
It is possible that the vaccine is not safe or effective in the preparation stage.
Preliminary research to test the efficacy of the vaccine using specific animal samples of COVID-19, such as ACE2-dose mice, other laboratory animals and non-human high-risk creatures, bio-protection-grade 3 measures to directly combat the virus, and the need for international coordination to ensure standard protection procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine or treatment for SARS that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and production of novel vaccines and vaccines for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions around the world.
When MERS came out, it was thought that existing SARS research would be a useful model in the treatment and production of vaccines against MERS-CoV disease.
As of now in March 2020, a MERS vaccine (DNA-based) was said to have completed phase I clinical trials on humans and three other ongoing, sub-vector-specific viral vaccines, two Adenoviral Vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS-GamVac), and one MVRS-GamVac.
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and that its vaccines are already available.
Various posts on social media indicate the presence of genetic sequences and vaccines in the patents and other tree of coronaviruses such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include dizziness, pain in the abdomen, diarrhea, swelling in the throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
It usually takes five days from appearance to the onset of symptoms, but can last from two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases the symptoms of the disease are mild, some go to viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 Mamaq and areas, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured of the virus - mainly through close contact with people, often in the form of mouth droplets when coughing, coughing or talking.
Although similar droplets come out when exhaling, they often fall to the ground or floor, rather than being able to catch the disease from a long distance.
After touching the affected surface, people can also get the disease by touching the eyes, nose or mouth with their hands.
The virus can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is the most infectious disease within three days of the onset of symptoms, although it can be spread both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the time-reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the tissue in the anus.
The use of masks is recommended for those who are suspected to be infected with the virus and for those who are in health care.
There is a difference in the proposal to wear masks for the general public, some officials are against its use, some suggest its use, and some are calling it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or special antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in more countries than in all regions of the World Health Organization.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or develop symptoms such as fever, cough, cough, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, frequent chest pain or pressure, mental arousal, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is advisable to seek immediate medical attention.
In the upper part of the respiratory tract, symptoms such as coughing, nosebleeds, or throat swelling can also be seen.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
In the beginning, there were only a few cases in China with chest pains and strokes.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, excessive organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can also be two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms of the disease will be infected within 11.5 days.
These affected people without symptoms are not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be susceptible to the disease.
The proportion of people infected with the disease is currently unknown, with no symptoms and is being studied, where the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all cases confirmed during hospital stay were without symptoms.
China's National Health Commission began counting cases without symptoms from April 1 in its daily cases; that day, 130 of the 166 infected patients (%78) were undiagnosed at the time of testing.
Viral loads can be higher in both tuberculosis and bulimia.
Talking in a loud voice leads to more drops than normal conversations.
A study in Singapore found that the droplets of untreated cucumbers have the ability to go up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioreceptive transmission may be possible and that samples of viral RNA have been found to be positive in those gathering in the hallway outside the individual's rooms.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can aerosolize respiratory tract and cause airborne infections.
The virus is most infectious when people show symptoms; and if the virus spreads before the appearance of symptoms is possible, the risk is reduced.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is now not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus was found to be active for one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel(AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper.
However, it keeps changing in terms of humidity and temperature.
If soaps and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products deactivate the virus's fatty protective layer, as well as clean the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
The other solution, Hayes Benzconium Chloride and Chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of the powder were taken within an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample saw the highest viral load, and the sixth patient saw the highest viral load in the second day's test.
The manifestation of symptoms of severe respiratory distress is coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a severe novel respiratory illness, which was first detected in three people in Wuhan with severe respiratory illnesses with pneumonia.
All characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
The pancreas are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because the viruses gain access to these host cells through the enzyme 2 (ACE2) that converts angiotensin, which is the most commonly found in the pancreas type II cells.
To connect the virus to ACE2, a certain level of gratitude enzyme called "cell" (pillomer) uses and enters the host cell.
12% of those hospitalized in the Chinese city of Wuhan were found to have a severe heart attack and are frequently found in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to diseases of the immune system while inflammation and disease spread throughout the body, but severe heart muscle injury can also be associated with ACE2 inhibitors.
2ACE is more apparent in the heart and is involved in the function of the heart.
Patients in the intensive care unit affected by COVID-19 had higher incidences of blood clots (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) in the shrimp and may be associated with poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a turnaround for the appearance of the ACE2 respiratory tract cervical cells, severe patients infected with COVID-19 have more inflammatory symptoms than the normal ones affecting the body.
In particular, the T-cell with sickle SM-CSF sequencing was found to be associated with the incubation of the inflammation IL-6-emitting single-cell and acute lung disease in patients infected with COVID-19.
There have also been reports of lymphatic cell interference at the time of the post-mortem.
The WHO has published several methods of testing for the disease.
The standard method of experimentation is reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on respiratory patterns derived from the creased infused cotton; however, can also use nasal wool or sputum patterns.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples to be taken in two weeks and the results are of little immediate importance.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate a variety of coronaviruses and published a genetic sequence to allow laboratories around the world to independently develop a series of polymerase responses (PCR) to detect the infectious disease caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which detect active infectious disease and whether or not a person has been infected in the past) were in the preparatory stages, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment of testing showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The FDA approved the first care center for use at the end of the month in the United States on March 21, 2020, and the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University issued diagnostic instructions to detect the epidemic, keeping in mind the medical characteristics and the pandemic risk.
Early infectious disease is common with two-sided multi-channel, ground glass optics, inappropriate, and later splitting foam.
As the disease progresses, full-blown, crazily piping (the thickness of the mushroom's hijab varies with the size of the mushroom) and stability may appear.
Some statistics on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 are available.
The main results of the post mortem are:
macroscopy: inflammation of the lungs membrane, inflammation of the covered heart, stabilization of the lungs, and swelling of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: a swelling of the lungs, the formation of more of a pneumocyte, a large abnormal pneumocyte, with the intrusion of lymphatic cells with rupture inflammation and the formation of multi-alpha-demony cells.
Severe pneumonia: Low risk of dehydration (DAD).
DA fear is a symptom of severe respiratory distress (ARDRS) and a severe lack of oxygen in the body.
Pneumonia: the organization of external disturbances in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary eczema
Blood: Blood clots in the veins (DIC); white and red blood reactions.
Precautions to reduce the risk of disease include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and washing hands for at least 20 seconds, practicing better respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and recommends the use of the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hygienic use of the hands after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth to cover the mouth of the crowd to limit the spread of the virus from people who do not show symptoms, social distancing strategies aimed at reducing contact with large groups of people by closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
Since the vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key point in combating COVID-19 is to reduce the highest level of the epidemic, which is called "filtering."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further suggests that at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be used, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO creates two formulas for local production.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity, ethanol, and isopropanol are produced.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacteria's ovaries; it is "not an active substance for the immune system in the hands."
Glycerol is poured as a mercury.
People have been organized with supportive care, including silica treatment, oxygen support, and support for other important affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Non-surgical membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to solve respiratory problems, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and a better diet have been proposed to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments can be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the pandemic, with recommendations published by the WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission for the care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., violent individuals and lung doctors have compiled a free resource, IBCC, with treatment suggestions from various agencies.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts suggested paracetamol (mistaminophen) as an important drug in place of ibuprofen.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of contracting the virus, especially in a medical environment where a medical procedure is taking place, such as an intrusion hose or hand ventilation.
For medical staff caring for people infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends general precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for airborne germs, as well as keeping the person in the Airborne Infection Room (AIIR).
The recommended equipment is: PPE gowns, device respirators or face masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. The device respirator is preferred (instead of face masks) when available.
The N95 device respirator has been approved for industrial environment, but the FDA has allowed the mask to be used only under emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against dust from pollutants such as airborne particles, but they do not guarantee the effect of use against a particular unlicensed biological agent.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using a face shield or homemade mask, as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 are often not so bad that they need machining rehab or replacements, but a few percent of patients need it.
The type of respiratory support is being actively studied in people hospitalized with COVID-19-related respiratory failure, with some evidence that intrusive drainage with high-flow nose canolas or bilaterally positive aeration can be avoided.
It is not known whether either of these two are equally beneficial to seriously ill people.
Some doctors prefer unpleasant machining stimuli when available because this method limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nose canolas. Severe disease is more common in older adults (especially in those over 60 years of age and those over 80 years of age).
Developed countries do not have enough beds per capita, limiting their ability to handle an increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in the health system who need to be hospitalized.
According to one study, 5% in China were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.3% were in need of mechanized ventilation, and 1.4% of deaths occurred.
In China, 30% of people infected with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
The pressure-regulating mode and high PEEP capable ventilators need to maximize oxygen transmission and minimize the risk of damage to the lungs associated with the ventilators and the congestion of air in the chest.
There will be no more PPE available on older ventilators.
Research for possible treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
Remdesivir seems to be the most optimistic.
Although it may take time until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced experimental stage.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe illness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that volunteers participate in experiments on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments.The FDA has allowed artificially cured individuals to use plasma experimentally in cases where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
It did not go through medical studies showing itself to be safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his name and identification number.
This app can tell the address of "close contact" using the monitoring data and therefore the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantining, it also warns local medical officials, including those in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, to find mobile phone data, face recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and big data analytics on artificial intelligence.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who should have the coronavirus.
The move was taken to ensure quarantine and to protect those who are in contact with the affected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared data collected from the mobile phone space with the German federal government's agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and control the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed face recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
The Italian regional health authority said they had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving around."
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with 42,000 candidates.
Estonia's President Kristi Kujolid also voiced her support for international efforts to find creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may have difficulties with self-quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the pandemic.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "More social distancing, isolation, health concerns, stress and economic distress are a complete disaster for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can take a light turn with or without some sign, which is similar to other common respiratory diseases such as common fever.
Normally, patients recover in two weeks, while patients recover in three to six weeks.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may also be at severe risk for COVID-19, but the data for COVID-19 is not available.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly turn into acute respiratory illness (ARDS), which can lead to shortness of breath, body mold, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body mold, abnormal bleeding, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting, especially in 6% of patients with COVID-19, was found to have a longer period of blood yeast enlargement, while kidney failure was observed in 4% of patients with this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 showed higher levels of liver enzymes (TRANAMENSIS).
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days spent in the hospital.
However, the time between hospitalization and death among the patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median period from the appearance of early symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full duration was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
Later, a medical examination of the dead lungs showed extensive damage to the lungs by the presence of air in the lungs in small oils.
Changes related to the disease of living virus cells have been observed in nematodes.
The image of the lungs is similar to the symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8 deaths were observed due to troponin or increased heart rate.
According to the United States March data, 89% of hospitalized patients already had some form of illness, and the availability of medical resources and socioeconomics in the region could also have an impact on mortality.
The rate of mortality varies due to regional variations, but this may also be due to difficulties in the procedure.
The low number of patients can lead to an increase in mortality.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of pre-existing diseases means that the current mortality rate is low.
Those who smoked had 1.4 times the appearance of severe symptoms of COVID-19 and the need for extreme care or mortality rate was 2.4 times higher than those who did not smoke.
The administration of Hong Kong Hospital saw a reduction in lung capacity from 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung inspections indicated organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of extreme care symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known if it had long-term immunity in people recovering from the past pandemic.
Immunity is potentially seen based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have also been cases in which positive results of the coronavirus have emerged again after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worsening due to the long-lasting infectious disease rather than re-infectious disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an infectious disease from animals.
Its origins are not known, but by December 2019, the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first occurrence of symptoms occurred on 1 December 2019.
WHO official publications reported on December 8, 2019, the first date of the onset of the disease.
A number of measures are usually taken to determine fatalities.
These numbers vary by region and time, and the number of tests performed, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex, and overall health factors.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and time-consuming cases from the lab to clinical or pandemic deaths from COVID-19 without confirming the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths and incidents as of now 17 April 2020 is 6.9 (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among confirmed cases, and the IFR, which reflects the percentage of deaths among infected people (verified and unverified).
These figures do not cover a specific time period and cover a specific population from disease to case-to-case solution.
Although antibodies are not present in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
A small village with a population of 4,600 in Italy's epicenter of the epidemic, Castiglian de Ada, of which 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangtok, the disease spread due to the festivals of Catholic Christians, and spread to underage people, which has led to relatively low mortality, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified in this way.
Moreover, Germany's health system has not been defeated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as estimated by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died of COVID-19.
The incidence and mortality rates of the pandemic are different in men and women.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate among men is higher.
The highest risk in men is after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women ends at just 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological variations, low consumption of tobacco in women and men, and the emergence of other diseases, such as hypertension at an early age, can lead to an increase in mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 of those infected were men and 72 of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not been able to find gender statistics for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most of the medical staff, especially the nurses, are women, and they are at higher risk of being infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19."
WHO President Tetdros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that COVID-19, the virus from VI, the disease from D, and 19 refers to the day when the first event occurred: 31 December 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographical location (for example China), animal type, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigma.
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both disease and varicose veins are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
During the early outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as transient names for viruses and diseases, according to a 2015 directive against using the name of the location in the name of disease and virus.
On February 11, 2020, the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released.
Due to the capacity limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are chasing medical equipment such as cotton and ventilators inserted into the nose.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the seller was unable to deliver in time, a local crafter copied it and made the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misunderstandings about the origin, duration, prevention, treatment and other initiatives emerged and quickly spread on the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral growth in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medications is ongoing by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "unilateral experiments" to assess the effects of treatment from four existing antiviral compounds with the highest efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same means to enter ACE2 human cells.
There are three methods of vaccination.
The goal is to develop a vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, must create an immediate immune system in the human body against the new disease of COVID-19.
Another strategy, the sub-component vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that creates a sensitivity against certain sub-components of the virus in the immune system.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the center of such research is the S Spike protein, which helps the virus enter the enzyme cell of ACE2.
The third strategy is the nuclear-acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, the novel method of producing the vaccine).
The experimental vaccines developed with these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy - the first clinical trial of the vaccine was launched on March 16, 2020, on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine consists of a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.The antibody-dependent enlargement in vaccine preparation for SARS-CoV-2 was proposed as a potential challenge, but it is controversial.
More than 300 clinical trials are currently underway as of April 2020.
Seven experiments are testing a drug that is already approved treatment for malaria, including four studies of haehydro oxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research consists of re-recommended antiviral drugs, with reports of nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, there has been a dynamic review process for candidates for the preparation and use of the COVID-19 vaccine. Several existing antiviral drugs are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine with chloroquine, Lopinavir/Reuters and Lopinavar.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence of efficacy from Remdesivir.
Medical improvements were observed in patients who were treated with less use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, we are still waiting for the results of the survey.
The medical administration of Korea and China suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommends a daily dose of one gram, reminds that double the dose of the drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for doctors who are engaged in the treatment of COVID-19 patients to use hydrochloroquine and chloroquine at their discretion.
Early data suggest that excessive amounts of robavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
After demonstrating low concentration in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2, nitazoxanide has been suggested for further veto studies. Studies have shown that transmembrane protease series 2 (TMS) is essential for entry into SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have major inhibitors in studies with or without azithromycin that have prevented the medical class from accepting the treatment without further studies.
Cytokine strome can be a complication in the post-acute phases of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine is characterized by an anti-cytokine strom, and after completing a brief study, Tuscaloosab was added to the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China.
Italy is undergoing phase 2 randomized testing at the national level after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
The combined serum ferritin blood test to identify the cytokine strom, it is intended to counteract such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, the FDA had approved an Interleukin 6 receptor competitor based on past studies on a variety of causes i.e. CART cell treatments for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release disease
To date, there is no randomized, convincing evidence that Tuscaloosa is an effective treatment against CRS.
The clean and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19, the transition to those who need it, are being researched as an inactive vaccine for an inactive vaccine.
This strategy was tested for SARS with undetermined results.
Viral neuralization is an expected procedure that can lead to inactive antibody treatments to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other methods, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of inactive antibody treatment, for example, the use of monoclonal antibodies, are being worked on.
The production of raw materials, which are the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and contain specific antibodies to the virus, can be developed for early use.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Lee Wen-Ling, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, was infected after raising awareness about the spread of the virus and died of COVID-19.
