Fast-growing contagious cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January 2020 to 15 March 2020
The cumulative cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are showing similar trends in the European Union and European Economic Area countries and in the United Kingdom, while in a different situation depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving fast in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and special intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of pneumonia cases of unknown pathology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause agent for the novel coronavirus was the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is known as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
As of this date, there is evidence that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, that is, respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these are curable.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% experience complex illnesses that require intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluate the trend of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with the incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and the EU
After China, there was a further geographic spread of COVID-19 and the rest of the world will now follow the dynamics of this country's COVID-19.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Eurosurveillance 2020, released on March 5, reported the first European COVID-19 confirmed by WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were seen in France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), including 31 December 2019 and on that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Receiving cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative events
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases worldwide, which are received only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health bodies, and the WHO, is updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK compared to Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, therefore, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, each EU/EEA country and in the UK during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020, we accounted for a short 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases.
We have also presented the cumulative number of reported cases in each country from 8:00 am to 15th March 2020 as compared to the period 31st January – 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the UK and the EU
The trend of 14-day accumulated cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend of Hubei Province (China).
For the EU/EEA and UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then rapidly increased around February 28, 2020 (Supplementary Materials).
This was largely driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar growth trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary Content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy from January 31 to March 15.
As of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries had reported a cumulative number of cases compared to 3 weeks or less before Italy.
Our results indicated that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has shown that the pandemic is moving forward at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is because different countries have different case definitions and different protocols in different countries to choose from, including national public health responses and catch-up tests to be tested for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, Italy described the situation in the affected areas in which <0x7E>10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and communications sources said hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are currently only available for 6% and 1% of cases at EU/EEA levels, respectively (the figures are not shown).
However, they must be collected in a systematic manner to meet the current monitoring data, which emphasizes the number of reported cases and deaths.
The study, conducted in 2010-11, showed a huge difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, extending from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that in many countries Italy may have more or less resources than 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care styles per 100,000 population)
Healthcare capacity saturation-related modeling scenarios, comprehensive hospitalizations for each EU/EEA country and the UK for COVID-19 cases that will exceed the intensive care bed capacity >90% risk-related, are provided the sixth update of the ECDC's Quick Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases are grouped in EU/EEA countries and in some areas in the UK and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily in the nomenclature of regional units for Figure 2 (NUTS-2) levels.
Italy's experience and recent trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units must prepare themselves for a sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and for a growing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and special intensive care, such as those in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid increase in the number of expected cases has led to a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to reducing the spread of SARS-COV-2 from control to mitigation due to the fact that decision-makers and hospitals may not be able to understand, accept and adopt their responses in a timely manner if not implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have a short period of time to have the opportunity to further increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, health care systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere and infected more than 80,000 people, which is a form of human destruction.
The SARS-CoV, which killed thousands of people in 2003, may have transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 from cameras and cause the same symptoms through the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but it is much more transmissible and has an impact on older people than young and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publishers in the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics about epidemiology, science, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate dangerous diseases.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020, has become unprecedented and unforgettable for the Chinese who have been asked to stay home for the entire holiday due to the outbreak of the new virus disease and for many weeks afterwards.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that brought about the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had confirmed more than 80,000 COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged and more than 3,000 deaths.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and is probably more powerful than terrorism.
According to Pubmed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months from the first report of January 7, 2020, including its virology, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment, which determined the virus isolated from multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in new and rapidly evolving subject areas.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another COVID-causing disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and diagnosis of the disease, as well as some of the remaining important questions.
CoVs are traditionally thought to be non-lethal pathogens for humans, accounting for about 15% of the Rugha 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic human coVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and quickly spread to many other countries with terrible pathologies and mortality.
This is the third COVID-19 outbreak in human history.
The group of pneumonia with unknown origins from Wuhan was initially reported to the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections of health-care providers were reported, suggesting that human-to-human infections were possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down by blocking all its public transport.
The first clinical study of the disease on January 24 reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has spread to about 50 other countries in China and around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation develops at a rapid pace, the final area and severity of the disaster remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 4,021 patients, including 8,866 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but mostly between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected people were over 50 years old, those under 20 were very young, and 14 of the infected people were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has mainly spread to Hubei and the surrounding areas.
It took an average of 5 (2-9 days) to be diagnosed with COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from diagnosis to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people has increased at a rapid pace before 23 January 2020, compared to the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed cases had a mortality rate of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and adjusted mortality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and closed viruses consisting of a strand of consciousness RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely, alpha, son, gamma and delta, in which alpha- and son-CoVs are known to infect humans.
Invalope spike (S) glyceloprotein binds to its cellular receptors SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and then the membrane is combined.
Viral RNA is released into the genome cytoplasm; after a replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA together with invading glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins make virulent polyps, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV in which more than 99.98% of the 10 sequences collected from the Wuhan seafood market in Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, were genetically identifiable.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through electron microscopy transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very small segments of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is a fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new small proteins that are signaled by orf3b and produced proteins that are signaled by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional area or special symptoms.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in a mixture with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They are linked as complex dimers with open or closed conformity and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provide evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a medical target for drug safety checks to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Host
It has been found that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted from civet cats and camels to humans, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison with other CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, the new virus bat is 96% compatible with two SARS-like CoVs bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which of the intermediate hosts helped the virus to infect humans by crossing the species barrier and the pathway of infection remains unclear.
Ji, et al. proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from the chameleon to the human, which contained recombination within the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that salic-long-shredded, cumilla-eating mammals are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - based on a 99% genetic similarity between the found CoV and SARS-CoV-2 found in salic, which is a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the variation of 1% prevalence across two genomes is a big difference; therefore, decisive results are awaited for concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live for up to 48 hours outside the body in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a humidity of less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and placed at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-like disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and other smooth solutions, but others other than chlorhexidine can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally has the ability to fight the disease in SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is suspected in the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
In general, after the virus attacks the host, it is first identified by the structured immunity (PRRs) through the host system, including C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of Type I interfaces (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and intensify macrophages phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV helps protect the virus from immune responses.
In short, adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in immunity.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T-Associated Funds produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can resist the functions of T cells by producing apoptosis of T cells.
Humeral immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies that are isolated from the disease have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the unnecessary response of the immune system locally creates a number of independent radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, even multi-organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as illustrated by mass initiation, is very likely to affect older men and pregnant women with epilepsy.
It is common that people who have been exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and in the range of 0 to 24 days.
Another recent study as described above shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, based on a population study of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health bodies to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most consistent incubation period, which prevents infected but symptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who have come into contact with or have been infected by the virus are usually required to isolate for 14 days.
The quarantine period should be extended to 24 days.
The main and early symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, which can have symptoms such as no other symptoms or dry cough, breath, muscle pain, ringta, headache, throat, watering from the nose, chest pain, soreness, wheezing and vomiting.
Some patients experienced difficulty breathing and/or hypoxemia a week after they had seen the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed to rapidly developing respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and cataracts.
The virus should also be checked for early diagnosis without fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic study conducted in the last December of 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms required ventilation support was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for puberty; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group formed due to infection from a symptomless person.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and even higher fatalities such as MERS than COVID-19.
In addition, 26% of patients with migraines (21%) and neck pain (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), difficulty in breathing (40%-42%), cough (20-25%) and throat swelling (13-25%) are the main symptoms and 14%-20% of patients have been found to be in need of ventilation support.
As of February 14, the worldwide confirmed cases were 66,576 with a fatality rate of 2%.
By November 2002, SARS had accounted for 10 percent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, which was based on a 2012 demographic study, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, similarly extending only to seeing the R0 of SARS-CoV 2 to 4.
Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2's MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with their symptoms, mortality and R0 are presented in Table 1.1.
The images above have a higher potential than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that spread SARS-CoV-2, making it less deadly than the last two.
Therefore, the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is far more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The group usually begins with a single family gathering or a cruise ship as a means of transportation.
Patients often have a history of having been in contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before traveling or living or showing symptoms in Wuhan or other affected areas.
However, people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who have been discharged from the hospital have been reported to be able to carry the virus again, which warns of an increase in quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients had a normal or decreased number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, white blood cell counts <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including lymphopenia and lymphocyte counts <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L and advanced aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood and some patients had increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood.
In patients with severe conditions, the levels of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation production in the blood, were elevated and the lymphocyte count was reduced respectively.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities found in chest radiology and this is seen together with the opacity of bilaterally diverse shades or dust silica in the lungs.
Patients often develop bizarre pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS, uncontrolled suction, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the gas exchange.
The malfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, so it reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung fatality.
Therefore, the worst chest radiographic searches are often parallel to the most severe extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decomposition of pneumocytes, the formation of haeline membranes and intermediate lymphocyte infiltration, and the viral infection in the lungs of patients who died from this disease and similar to ARDS pathology, and the synthetic cosines of SARS and MERS patients.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaxon (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis in China (which were no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) began to be used on February 13, 2020.
The same situation was seen in SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical expression, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fang Chang Group described the protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to identify SARS-CoV-2, which uses dipsticks of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (100 copies per microliter input at RRS-2-RS).
Optimistically, new methods can dramatically improve sensitivity and convenience if proven in therapeutic samples.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, physicians can provide primary supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying different therapies previously used or offered to treat other COVs and other viral diseases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table 2.2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, asteroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It is recommended to use antibiotics for the treatment of patients with diabetes.
Pharmaceutical companies are running to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the lungs at the beginning and perhaps even to a lesser extent other organs, which express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major risk and leading cause of death for patients.
Therefore, respiratory aid is extremely important to provide relief to the symptoms and to save lives, and it includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and aggressive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by the modified cardiopulmonary bypass technology, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), which is used to treat cardiovascular or respiratory failure that is life-threatening.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention of secondary infections and septic shock, treatment and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine is known to cause typhoid fever in SARS and MERS patients with a greater response to the immune system.
Cytokine is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of independent radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of T fund-directed immune responses; inhibition of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; Blinatumab; suppression of cytokine signals 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as an immunosuppressant in the treatment of SARS to reduce seriousness and inflammatory damage.
However, high amounts of steroids were not beneficial for patients with severe lung disease in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious other effects, especially avascular osteoporosis, which dramatically affects the diagnosis of the disease.
However, only low-to-medium doses of corticosteroids are recommended for careful use in patients with complex COVID-19.
At the time of this writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug initially developed by Ziliad to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential resistance to other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based in Yin, Jiliyad provided the compound in China to conduct tests on some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and the results were highly appreciated.
In addition, bericitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as a potential treatment for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment of Lopinavir/Retonavir can cause acne, vomiting, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
Interactions with other medications should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production of recovered patients
There is a long history of blood collection from patients recovering from infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy people from the disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have a relatively high level of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other external objects and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, reducing burns and viral loads and improving oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, certification and explanation are required to propose a law for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening virus.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low and there is a lot of demand for plasma to treat patients with complex conditions.
It is difficult to quickly prepare and produce enough specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that indicate effective antibodies or to check for effective antibodies against the virus's essential proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in the treatment of various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple parts in one formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and prove the best combination of such components or them.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from a serious condition.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du Capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The top treatment rate in the treatment of COVID-19 patients was seen in some provinces of China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest treatment rate (13%).
However, this is an approximate comparison due to the fact that the evaluation should include many other effective factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Chang and colleagues published a study to compare the combined treatment of WM and TCM with Western Medicine (WM) treatment.
They found that the need for improvement in body temperature, loss of symptoms and time to stay in the hospital was less than that of the WM<0x2B>TCM group alone.
Most impressively, the symptomatic deterioration rate (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group than for the WM group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for better controlled trials in large quantities and at more centers.
It will also be fascinating to describe the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatment or their combination, if possible.
Most people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience great fears, including high contagious and deadly diseases, and people with quarantine also experience drowsiness, isolation, and resentment.
In addition, the adverse effects of treatments such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental problems.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses, including persistent stress, anxiety, panic, psychomotor stimulation, psychoactive symptoms, delirium and suicide, were reported.
Compulsory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more concerned and guilty about the impact of infections, quarantines, and laxatives on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health services should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have been in contact with them as well as those in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication and treatment plans with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the use of passive electronic tools and equipment to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to disrupt the chain of infections from animal reservoirs and infected humans to vulnerable hosts and are often supplemented for antiviral treatment in the control of the pandemic caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful neutral antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Direct-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, before starting clinical studies, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness and safety of these vaccine candidates within the body of the vaccine candidates and their protection against zoonotic viruses.
So SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported so far.
In contrast, MERS' footfalls and clusters in the Middle East are constantly visible and spread to other regions that are caused by the continuation of zoonotic sources in the local area.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using passive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nano particles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein sub-units and some have been evaluated in animal samples.
The ongoing development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and important task to control the pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficult situation due to the long period (average 18 months) required for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just begun to reveal its full medical pathway to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may be able to recover without a sequel.
However, in patients with severe cases such as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, creating a pattern of disease prediction for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritise their services, especially in areas where there is no resource.
Based on reports from clinical studies so far, the following factors may influence or bind to the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Was the most important factor for predicting SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of patients found to be over 50 in 8,866 cases.
Patients with underlying illnesses and complications that require intensive care and those who are not or are significantly older (the average age of 66 and 51) are more likely, which suggests the prognosis factor age of the disease for the return of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000).
Surrogacy and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart attack and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive collagenocytes, which can cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is useful to note that age and underlying diseases are so related and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-response protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been proposed to be a potential disease indicator factor for disease, treatment response, and ultimate health benefits.
It has also been proposed to correlate the CRP levels and severity and disease prediction of COVID-19.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine cyanase (CK) can also predict the yield.
These enzymes are seen extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and tend to disappear when tissue is damaged.
This is a classic example of college or university education.
Main therapeutic symptoms: Temporary improvement of chest radiography and therapeutic symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of suction damage.
With high levels of corticosteroids being widely used in patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors suffered from vascular osteonecrosis with long-term disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and in COVID-19 patients for short periods of time.
Mental stress: As described above, during the period of the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have been subjected to extraordinary stress due to prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty and the death of close family members and fellow patients.
These patients need psychological counseling and long-term support to help them get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to a recent study, COVID-19 has a different pandemic than SARS.
In addition to increased numbers in the lower respiratory tract, the upper respiratory tract of SARS-CoV-2 may also increase substantially and may show less symptoms or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, such as other coVs.
Therefore, patients infected during the initial stage or incubation period can produce excessive amounts of the virus during daily activities, which makes it very difficult to control the pandemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was said to only occur when the disease was severe, while most transmissions were not at an early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of curbing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a pandemic shutdown.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak can occur in March and the downfall situation lasts 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19 will not end in 2020, seeing more contagious than SARS.
Ira Langini, et al., established a pattern predicting the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could cause two-thirds of the global population to be infected.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and returned home two weeks ago, which could lead to a cyclic series of newly identified virus influenza-like.
However, there have been optimistic indicators based on the declining number of new cases in China, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause half a million deaths with one million cases.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is finally under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 can become weakened in infection and eventually die or co-exist with a less pathogenic virus with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 transmits excessively through coughing or sneezing and possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
It was also found in the direction of the virus, which increases the new possibility of malware-to-face transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were likely caused by a hospital-generated infection, with 17 patients having other pre-existing diseases and 40 being health-care providers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect human beings, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and those who are in contact with sick or infected people.
The first line of defense used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing a face mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (Series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid sprays from potentially infected people from traveling through the air or from sticking to the surface of the materials, where they can move to others.
Although N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks can only protect against inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viruses are able to enter completely; SARS-CoV-2 is identical in size with SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can also be covered by five-colored surgical masks, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Category <0x23>1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear isolation gowns that are fitted to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor wearing an N95 mask was infected with SARS-CoV-2; the virus must have entered his body through his inflammatory eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from the disease.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus in the human world, the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak of high conformity of SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have given high warning in China.
However, as of today, 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control has not consoled citizens with the fact that the new virus is less infectious and limited reproduction from human to human and has no problems in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message calmed down the people's woes, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and Wuhan had a very important time to stop the disease at its lowest level.
China's disease control agencies can take this difficult lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies (1) should be more careful when making public announcements because each word is important to the citizen and may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) should be more sensitive and responsive to the extraordinary information of the clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from the physicians and authorities; (3) should be more responsive and responsive to the public’s efforts to improve the public’s response to the pandemic’s impact on its early stages; and (4) should be more stringent to control the public’s disease.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this, it has spread across China and around 50 other countries worldwide.
The virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and as the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% and 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they are symptomatic, while SARS patients can only do so often when they are seriously ill, which makes it much more difficult to control COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated can again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
With such a rapid development of research in COVID-19, serious complex problems remain to be solved as follows:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-like CoVs was found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
What kind of animal was the first to be transported from the human body to the human body?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't effectively cut infections and repeat outbreaks at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemistry tests have shown to bind to SARS-CoV-2 ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and then bring about pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-exposed cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving in the course of infection among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, die like SARS or be repeated periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, as much as it demands, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The genetic origins of human coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation have co-developed coronaviruses (CoVs) and have run their hosts with people for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) had been diagnosed with a mild illness like a cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have turned the coin to show how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has once again inhibited CoVs in the spotlight and we are surprised by its high transmission but its sister is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs will help us.
Most of the HCoVs are derived from measles where they are non-infectious.
Some HCoV intermediate storage hosts are also known.
Identifying infected animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Research into CoV-host interactions in animals can also lead to important insights about CoV pathogens in humans.
In this review, we present a brief overview of the invention of the seven HCoVs, as well as existing knowledge about them, focusing on their zoonotic origins and history of interspecies infections.
Importantly, we compare and distinguish different HCoVs from the perspective of virus development and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic has been discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host change and the effects of virus development on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a coronavirus family that includes a group of defective, positive-positive, single-standard RNA viruses.
These viruses sheltering the largest genome of RNA viruses at 26 to 32 kilobases were called "CoVs" due to the crown-like figure under their electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have non-divided genomes that share the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large encrypted open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) translated into pp1a and pp1ab polypropylene.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce nsp1<0x7E>16, 16 non-structural proteins specified.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins, which include spikes (S), whales (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many descendants-specific auxiliary proteins have also been encoded by descendants of different CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequence, CoVs are classified into four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV gene contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Ethnic evidence has shown that bats and bats are the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been constantly crossing the barriers of different species and some have emerged as important human diseases.
To date, there are seven known human coVs (HCOVs).
They are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 often cause mild symptoms such as acne and/or acne.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic due to severe lower respiratory tract infections in more patients than those with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory problems syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nose of patients who had coughed in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through detailed studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which lead to self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept of infection of HCoV was generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS was widely accepted.
The SARS outbreak, which infected more than 8,000 people in 2003, with nearly 10% of raw cases, is the most devastating in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak will result in a pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula and it will spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 Nobel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoV viruses originate from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show a large genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides frameworks for understanding the driving force of natural history, restriction factors and species jumping.
It can also guide or search for reservoir, intermediate and amplifier animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 with significant impact on future outbreak prevention.
In this review we present a brief description of zoonotic origins, interspecies infections and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss that the generic topic of HCoVs is usually non- pathogenic in their natural location hosts but becomes pathogenic after the side-infection to the new host.
We also review the trend of HCoV development in which the growth of transmission is often in accordance with the lack of pathogenicity.
The results of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
CoVs of animals have been discovered since the late 1930s.
The sinking garden from the nose of the infected patients was tired of the B814 and the HCoV-229E had previously discharged various CoVs on various infected animals, including turkeys, Moses, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs, before leaving.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and later adapted to grow on the WI-38 lung cell lines.
In 10-20% of cases of patients infected with HCoV-229E, symptoms of common coughing, including fever and coughing, headache, dizziness, and neck pain were observed.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the serial passage that followed in part culture and kissing mushrooms.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomaticly different from the infection of other respiratory pathogens such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have been distributed globally and they can be transmitted mainly during the winter season that occurs in moderate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to the Human Volunteer Study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have mild symptoms.
Only a small number of patients with immune risk exhibited severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "unusual pneumonia," was the first well-documented epidemic in human history to be spread by HCoV and the etiological agent found by the third HCoV is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS was detected in China's Guangdong province since 2002.
As a result of the SARS pandemic, 8,096 cases were reported, with 774 deaths spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to super-spreaders, each event can give rise to approximately two supporting events that occur within the 4 to 7-day incubation period and the 10th day of the extreme disease of viral load.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV are initially diagnosed with myelitis, headaches, fever, unwellness and chills, and are seen as retarded symptoms following dyspepsia, coughing and respiratory problems.
Lymphopenia, neural malignancy testing and advanced creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
The loss of the revealed airway, the increase of epithelial cells and the fetus cells in the lungs have been seen in patients with SARS disease.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the intestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, can also be infected in these severe cases, usually with cytokine removal deficiency, especially in patients with low immunity.
The virus was first isolated from the lung test of the relative of the infected patient who had travelled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.
Since then, there has been a lot of research done on the HVAC system.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands during 2004.
It appears in the early stages in children and people with low immunity and respiratory diseases.
Presentation of cholera, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is recognized in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and its high incidence occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 in Hong Kong was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to the community that includes pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide due to a silent respiratory disease.
These four communities that contain HCoVs have been well adapted in people and are currently less likely to mutate for highly pathogenic diseases, despite accidents for unknown reasons in rare cases of more toxic subtypes of HCoV-NL63 reported to have been infected with severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs are transmitted from one person to another and have the ability to keep themselves inside the human body, they are also less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and migraine failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Central East, sometimes with both close contacts in European countries and imported cases in Tunisia have been reported.
In 2015, another outbreak occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
As defined by progressive acute pneumonia, the clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute migraine failure that is unparalleled for MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients with stomach and intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting, are present.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 labs had confirmed that the death rate of people infected with the virus was more than 34.4%, making MERS-CoV the most devastating virus.
During the period from mid-December 2019, single cases of pneumonia were found to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of the respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a fatality rate of 3.4% of the initial cases.
Notably, Hubei, China's case fatality rate is 4.2% while the area outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that are present as fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties.
It is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms that can quickly progress to problems such as acute respiratory symptoms.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the same due to the high homology of 82% of the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped in different halves in the ethnographic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but is more transmissible when compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid transmission worldwide.
The comparison and difference between SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoVs reveals similarities and differences of great interest.
Initially, the incubation period and the duration of the HCoV disease course are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 has other common trends of HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 falls among the four communities that include SARS-CoV and HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits more commonly visible characteristics during the period of infection in the community that includes HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, small subsets of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in cases of SARS-CoV infection, even if the ratio is light.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also features a willing pattern of the community that includes both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 remains at least higher than that of HCoVs acquired by the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be proven that the SARS-CoV-2 infection does not decrease after entering people as the conditions of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
The fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does not play an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, as will be evident by future studies.
To see if there is SARS-CoV-2 or not requires a particularly high interest that can demonstrate the same trend as in the event of community-acquired HCoVs being infected.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including its infection, pathogenesis, and longevity after infection in humans, will be effective in the final fate of the COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired HCoVs showing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
On the other side, people have been well adapted to these four HCoVs that can be true.
In other words, both can survive the old HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in people and people who develop severe HCoV diseases have been removed.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in an adequate amount against the host restriction factor allowing adaptive mutation storage.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 continues, the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent infection in humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four communities involved in CoVs have moved on to the human populations that fall victim to immunocompetent themes.
There is no need for animal shelters.
In contrast, highly pathogens SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are also not adaptable and cannot be managed in humans.
They need to maintain and promote their product stores, possibly needing a chance to spread hypersensitive human traits through one or more intermediate and enlarged hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are compatible with the four communities that include both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and HCoV.
At least according to the time, HCoVs are highly transmissible, just like the community that is involved.
However, it is more prone to HCoVs in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether the human body moves or moves without a storehouse or a host of medium animals.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it serves us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the developmental, natural, storage, medium and growing hosts of HCoVs.
An animal HCoV acts as an evolutionary host but shelters near-relative ancestors who share a high symmetry at the level of this nucleotide sequence.
Ancestral viruses are often well adapted and non-pathogenic in the host.
As such, a reservoir host HCoV acts as a port for a continuous and long-term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or this ancestral virus.
On the contrary, if people in an HCoV medium host have been introduced to it before or recently, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This medium host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and can play a role in increasing the host by transmitting it to humans to increase the scale of human infection by giving the virus to repeat it temporarily.
If HCoV does not manage transmission within the mediumhost, it can exit from the dead-end infection.
On the contrary, HCoVs can optimize the medium host as well as establish long-term destinations.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
The pandemic data revealed a history of contact with sports animals in a retrospective SARS indicator case.
Further seroprevalence research indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
In the areas of masked palm sivets and live animals, raccoon dogs were identified for transmitting SARS-CoV-like viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV.
It was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all of the seaweeds were killed in the market.
However, the masked palm civets that come from the wild or farms were not directly shown in animal habitats that were reported to be largely unfavorable to SARS-CoV, and the masked palm civet may not only serve as a central promoter host, but it was also reported to have no SARS-CoV natural reservoir.
With 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou market having SARS-CoV antibodies, many species of small mammals may also be able to act as an intermediate promoter host of SARS-CoV, which is remarkable.
All of these are known as SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
After the search for a natural animal host of SARS-CoV, a closely related bat CoV was uncovered which was called Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is located in Chinese Herssu bat.
These cameras are positive for the genome sequence of anti-SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence conformity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept of the emergence of human pathogens by the host of camouflage.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) were identified from the beam, but no virus can be isolated as a living virus except for a specified WIV1.
The human angiotensin that converts enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered a receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 taken from a fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bats, civets and humans ACE2 as a receptor for cell penetration.
Surprisingly, SARS-related serum patients were able to inhibit WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV to 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology shared on cameras.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally not an immediate ancestral virus of SARS-CoV and is believed to be not an immediate storage host of SARS-CoV.
Racial analysis also clusters MERS-CoV in the same group as Chamra CoV-HKU4 and Chamra CoV-HKU5.
Diptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) uses the same host receiver as CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are closely related on the basis of genealogy that is the opposite of the bat beta CoV identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no direct MERS-CoV has been found in the wild.
MERS-CoV and its closest related cameras CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
As a result, the MERS-CoV can't be stored immediately.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East found that dramedy camels are sero-positive to specific MERS-CoVs that affect antibodies such as camels of Middle Eastern origin in multi-African countries.
The live MERS-CoV was created from a camel's nose similar to the virus found in humans and also indicates that the camels act as hosts of MERS-CoV.
Usually mild symptoms but the study conducted on camels infected with MERS-CoV showed that the virus's flow was enormous, which is remarkable.
In particular, infected camels have not only extracted the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the excretory and urinary tract, which is also the main pathway for the virus to get out of the bats.
Although questions remain as to why many confirmed cases of MERS did not have a contact history with the camel before the onset of symptoms that recognizes in the human-human transmission or unknown transmission pathway, it includes unidentified animal species and covers MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a lump of CoV RaTG13 that is isolated from rhinophoses.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence deviation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is a great thing to maintain.
That is to say, bats can't be the immediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 until they have almost the same bat CoVs in the future.
Estimatedly, moderate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals that have been killed in the wholesale market of Huanan Seafood, with many early cases of COVID-19 associated with an indication of a possible animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of low-risk small mammals known as pengolins (Manis javanika) can also control beta-coVs of SARS-CoV-2-related ancestry.
The cov genomes of these newcomers share a homology of 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are similarly closely related to about 90% of identified RaTG13 at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sub-genres of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a racquet tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% of amino acid sequence-identified SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more different, despite the higher degree of homology genome-wide sequence.
A previous study about unhealthy years also reported that viral contagions were detected from samples of the same lung as SARS-CoV-2.
The study has adopted various convention methods and manual treatments to create a partial genome sequence containing a viral genome of about 86.3% full length.
We can't eliminate this possibility because the long-lived beetle is one of the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct yearly origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence deviation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that of the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The developmental pathway of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be established in Chamorro, Salk and other mammals.
Finding the high sequence homology in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Salk, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the homology of the highest genome-wide sequence.
High similarity between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is highly projected to have been driven by the selection-mediation convergence development.
The proposal is in favor of a recombination between the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 of the year in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in development, the connection between beta-CoVs has been extensive.
Jury is still in the immediate genome of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Ethnic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from covid while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mosquitoes.
It has been reported that it exhibited a close association with the HCoV-NL63 of the Chamero CoV, ArCoV.2 (Apalachean Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor.
On the other hand, when camels were also suspected to be its moderate host, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV known as Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana.
For clarity, the current knowledge on the origin of known HCoVs animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission cases of HCoVs in history.
HCoV-OC43 was recorded as an epidemic of respiratory infections, while about 1890 passed species to infect people from domestic animal husbandry.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
There is an alpha-CoV.
Different rows of evidence support the transmission of the virus directly from the beam to people.
Initially, people, rather than pets, can get in touch with camcorders in a shared environment.
On the other hand, people are in close contact with their pets.
Second, the alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are varied and non-pathogenic in bats, as long as the alpha-CoV causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas receive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses that include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans, which is not surprising.
Alternatively, as Chamero Alpha-CoVs support HCoV-229E as a hereditary bridge, small and dromedary camels can act as intermediate hosts to transmit the virus to people just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies infection from bats to drummery camels and drummery camels to humans.
The developmental origins of MERS-CoV from bats are known in its early identification and have also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich tenor to virus species for the intersection of the transmission of genetic pieces.
These are all favorable conditions for longevity, densely populated colonies, a perfect 'virus administrator' for chameleons with close social contact and a strong ability to fly.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced for dromedary camels for decades.
It is well adapted from these medium hosts to static and natural storage hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic infection in humans is accidental and people remain the dead-end host of MERS-CoV as it is unable to manage its infections.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of long-lived combing organisms in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains different, if any.
In particular, year-on-year beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic over the years.
They may be dead-end hosts for SARS-CoV-2 related to beta-CoVs similar to those in the case of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 will eliminate many possibilities for inter-transmission from animals to humans or will be explored in future studies.
Primarily, bats can host a reservoir of viruses, almost like SARS-CoV-2, that are related to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share the ecological refuge with the chameleon through butchering or coal mining.
Second, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be one of the medium hosts that have recently been introduced.
They kill and kill their brothers and sisters.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of domesticated and wild animals are mandatory for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, reinfection and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and long-lived comb-eating organisms.
Searches for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still ongoing.
In addition to a variety of animal hosts, the three key factors on the viral side are also important to help CoVs overcome species barriers.
First of all, their RNA replication mutation rate is comparatively high.
Compared to other single RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV is between "moderate" to "high" whereas the average replacement rate, including the adaptation of the Nobel host, is <0x7E>10-4 per site per year.
CoVs have an evidence-reading exoribonucleus, which results in extremely high mutations and degradation or invisibility in the deletion.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remediator is known to suppress CoV replications through the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is the most reliable anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than in the beginning.
Also, the mutation rate is often higher when the CoVs are not well-adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV having a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, according to a high level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps it has been adapted to another host that is close to people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well-adapted to drummer camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetically induced SARS-CoV-2 will present a vaccine and antiviral to make it effective as soon as possible.
Second, the massive RNA genome in CoVs projectes additional plasticity in the genome modification for mutation and recombination, which increases the potential for interoperability-development that is beneficial and suitable for the emergence of Novel CoVs.
It is supported by enough unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs can change the format over time through a random and often unique "copy-option" mechanism.
In a host working as a mixed vessel, the strand switching occurs repeatedly during the transcription period of CoV RNA.
Highly virtuous full-length and sub-genomic RNAs can be recombinant to generate new COVs.
Genetic evidence of the natural recombinant has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as CoVs in animals such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the host in the transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another effective key factor in interracial transmission.
Subsequently, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, also showing evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission conditions.
Based on a comparative analysis of the differences between human and sewage SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is subjected to rapid conversions in various hosts, especially with mutations in the RBD of S protein.
In general, the RBD in the S protein of CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected intensively by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the S1 segment in the 318th to 510th amino acids, which serves to adjust its coreceptors for human ACE2 as well as viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors in various animals that allow transmission of the virus against the intravenous, including bats, cats, rats and one-of-a-kind dogs.
In fact, 6 amino acid residues were found to be different from human and sivet viral isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Sivat SARS-CoV has the K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD that can enhance the similarity of the interaction of spike proteins with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids alternatives can be important in viral adaptation for humans.
The process of sharing SARS-CoV-2 with the same cellular neuron SARS-CoV is remarkable.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that human ACE2 may be altered in relation to the bonding of its S protein.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a higher similarity of 10 to 20 folds of this binding than the protein between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV.
There will also be a desire to determine whether or not any other corcepters may or may not be necessary for the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but also binds to the different part of S.
Many other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated cialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be prone to successful adaptation of these CoVs after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of inter-living transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host dependence and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between human and HCoV's natural hosts such as Chamorro, dromedary camels, and mosquitoes can lead to interspecies infections.
HCoV has to resist host dependence factors and launch host restriction factors for a successful intersection transmission.
In this regard, it remains to identify and portray nuclear determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction.
A fair genome-wide screening of restrictions factors for SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful using host dependence and cutting-edge CRISPR technology.
The rise of Novel HCoVs: came from zero.
CoVs that occur in bats provide ample opportunities for the emergence of Nobel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene broadcaster of HCoVs.
In addition, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination also bring about the development of HCoV and serves as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or reduction of a new protein coding gene has the potential to change viral phenotypes.
Among the supplemental proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-related chimeras viruses have been isolated but found to have encoded different ORF8 proteins, so ORF8 is considered important in people's adaptation.
The 29-nucleotide deletion feature of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human pandemic.
It divides ORF8a and ORF8b into extinct ORF8b and is considered to be a customized mutation that enhances the host's capacity.
Moreover, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination among descendants with alpha and gamma-CoVs with a large number of small recombinant regions identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Recombination locations were also identified in most parts of nsp9, nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombinant conditions among various descendants of dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination conditions have also been observed in HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal coVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection can contribute to unnecessary changes in viral genomes, while the host immune system must take precautions to get rid of viruses at maximum possible selection pressures.
Examples of these effects are due to the deletion of two nucleotides, the loss of ORF4 of full-length in the HCoV-229E prototype strain.
While inactive ORF4 HCoV-229E can be observed in bats and camel viruses, alpha-CoVs perform a single nucleotide insertion for framshifts.
Last but not least, the development of Novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure they have on their repository hosts.
Indicating the mutual compatibility between CoV and bats, the bats showed no symptoms or mild symptoms when they were infected with CoV.
It seems to be well adapted to CoVs both physically and psychologically.
For example, errors that appear in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in chamomile is suppressed due to the low expression level of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
Moreover, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the CoV replication and affect preferring by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selected pressure for the production of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when introduced to the new host.
Additional pathogenic CoV strains may also develop by recombining the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for the adaptation of the host.
Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be three novel HCoVs in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-infectious or they cause mild symptoms in their storage hosts, such as bats and camels.
They strongly mimic the host's immune response.
The mystery of what is happening is why carriers are appearing in symptomatic cases and can be caused by serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the immune response and hyperactivity of cytokine stoma, the more severe the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is isolated from the CoV replication.
A similar strategy of immune response delinking can have a beneficial effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reactions are particularly powerful in the camera.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon should also be beneficial to people in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
All four community-acquired HCoVs showing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
On the other side, people have been well adapted to these four HCoVs that can be true.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are generated.
If a bat beta-CoV is found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, a bat-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2 is present.
Similarly, viruses similar to SARS-CoV and other animals have been found on the market, with no immediate middlemen being identified for SARS-CoV-2.
Salk may act as one of the immediate hosts or Salk's son-CoVs have been found to be exceptionally virtuous in SARS-CoV-2, indicating that they can contribute fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was known or accidental.
CoVs have gained public attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the zoonotic origins of HCoVs in human transmission and the importance of animal stores.
Widespread evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have their origins and are transmitted to people through moderate hosts.
The SARS-CoV infection arises from contact between humans and seaweeds in the market, closing the wet markets and killing its seaweeds can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
From the same logic, keeping in mind the search for multiple descendants of year-old son-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the year-olds must be removed from the weight market to prevent zoonotic transmission.
However, future research into whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the years and other mammals remains unclear.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the camels for a long time.
These camels serve as important means of transportation and as the main source of local meat, milk, skin and wool products.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS due to actions taken in China's wild animals market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent a persistent outbreak of MERS, extensive access must be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other measures of infection.
We are not able to remove these viruses so new genotypes may appear to be a cause of the outbreak.
There are different types of coyotes in the forest.
In particular, the chromosomes with zoonotic potential are so diverse.
There are many possibilities for the development and recombination of these zoonotic CoVs that will lead to the emergence of new more infectious and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
In some places in China, the culture of eating wild animals must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
According to the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 tests, a good preparation and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a very long time.
They stay in their natural reserves until there is a possibility of spillover.
Although bats have many features to favor the spread of the virus, humans can reduce their chances of coming in contact with animals if they are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species.
In order to better understand the environment of CoVs and their natural hosts, mammals need to be constantly monitored, which will prove useful in preventing subsequent transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological location of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Many of the fragments in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if Chamorro transmits the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to Pengolin, it will be interesting to observe under what circumstances Chamorro and Pangolin can share the same ecological space.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease in humans, how people get into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true medium host, it should explain how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and calves.
Finally, pets, including many mammals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, so both monitoring and experimental activity should be planned.
Whether it's bats, calves or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or ancestral viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Research conducted in this area will clarify the developmental pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with important effects on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
"The diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 ""suspicious cases"" and ""confirmed cases"" need to be updated"
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Quick Tips Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and this guideline made a good reference to the fight against this pandemic globally by providing our experience.
Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnoses and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
"In this letter, we have responded to a comment made in our directory and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for ""suspicious cases"" and ""confirmed cases"" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment directories for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China."
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick consultation guideline and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since it was published.
Keep in mind that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, with a total of seven editions with some references to actual changes.
Now that our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al., they introduced a general score proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our directory and makes it an important reference to the global pandemic.
We thank them for their important work.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), any one of the epidemiological history features to confirm the suspected case needs to be linked to a detailed analysis with two objects of clinical expression or to complete three objects of clinical expression without a clear epidemiological history:
History of Epidemiology: (1) History of travel or residence to other communities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in Wuhan city and surrounding areas or regions in the past 14 days before symptoms appear; (2) History of contact with confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases, contacts with confirmed cases, and contacts with other confirmed cases (including positive nucleic acid tests) in Wuhan city or surrounding areas before symptoms appear; (2) History of contact with COVID-19 cases (with positive nucleic acid tests); and other cases reported in Wuhan city or surrounding areas before symptoms
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) having imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) a total white blood cell count showing normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte counts at the initial starting stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following substances such as pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) Viral Hole genome sequence showing high homogeneity from positive to positive to positive IRS-CoV-2 in known novel coronaviruses; (3) SARS-CoV-2 in serum test
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathological identities of the blood sample were added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
Based on the researchers, these modifications increased the availability of various samples and continued work to find the best nucleic acid detection kits for samples from the respiratory pathway, including blood samples, which supported the rapid diagnosis of specific antibodies and brought positive results to confirmed criteria.
Moreover, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to be careful of patients who show strange symptoms and do not show symptoms.
"Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified a person who did not have clinical symptoms as ""low risk""."
The score system also needs to be certified in further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence and invitations are coming to the readers to provide their comments.
"To identify suspicious cases and ""confirmed cases"", we recommend tracking and following the latest guidelines from their home countries."
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to provide help.
Bangladesh reports the highest number of new deaths per day due to COVID-19
Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest number of daily deaths due to the virus.
As of today, Bangladesh's Epidemic, Disease Control and Research Institute (IEDCR) reported that the recorded cases include 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who are staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news release, Dr. Mirzaidi Sabrina Flora, director of the IEDCR, said that the fatality involved four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzaidi, the two cases were above 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years, and one 41-50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
A hospital staff told the Anadolu Agency, a local news reporter, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Commission against Corruption in Bengal, who was being treated at Kuwait Friendship Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, in an online video announcement, said that public transport will be closed for longer than originally planned until this coming Saturday.
Work on the closure of public transport was initially started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred in two people who had returned from Italy on March 8 and one of them was his wife.
As of March 19, three of these have already been recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1 million people worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections reached one million globally, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
Kosedunga came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea has claimed that it was one of the few countries to be freed from the coronavirus infection.
As of today, the World Health Organization has confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. Central European time (08:00 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 people died in the US on Wednesday due to the coronavirus infection.
All over the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Macau, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian people will continue to receive unpaid wages until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; 10 Absents and 215 voted against.
Saudi Arabia increased curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; the previous time, the curfew was only effective between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
In Ohio, Mike DeWine's governor announced the extension of the order to stay at home until May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the limit of toilet paper per business.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's store chain Woolworths and Coles reduced the purchase ban on toilet paper in all stores at the national level to two and one package per transaction, respectively.
ALDI also started a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as a message at the checkout and on Chen's Facebook pages.
Buyers were reportedly raising stocks due to fears that people would need to self-isolate when COVID-19 hit.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one packet per business.
The changes were followed by a previous four-page trade ban introduced by Woolworths and Coles, which began on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his media release on March 8, reported that with a four-packet ban, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery," and that the demand was "unprecedented," while ALDI, Le, in a Facebook post in Mangalbar, called it "unexpected."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, last week there was a "very high" increase.
The costcose store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To further mitigate the shortage, Coles ordered large packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI quickly made the stock available for a special plan on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers wanted to increase stocks, but the local council's restrictions made it difficult at the time of truck delivery.
He expects an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet the demand and only a few are special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the initial distribution of the stock, some stores will not be able to operate Wednesday specials.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill stocks every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a large-sized item, which reduces the number of stocks, and, when sold, leaves a large self-space, which further strengthens the feeling of scarcity.
"The point of view of Coal and Ulworths is that [that] if there were plenty of goods in the warehouse, products like toilet rolls and sanitizers could [buy] and there are enough, you can reduce the trouble," said Russell Zimmerman of ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Hu Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were able to stock up.
According to news.com.au report, the company was working 24/7 to supply solaris paper making Kimberly-Clark and serbents to clean toilet tissue.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property sellers had offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, reducing the auction planning due to time constraints by the buyers over the long weekend of Labor Day.
Printed in Darwin, the Thursday edition of the Daily NT News, 8 additional pages were inserted for the purpose of cutting and using as a toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, stores were originally reluctant to ban, saying they had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said that the products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and backpacks.
On Sunday evening, the online British supermarket Ocado was found to have restricted the purchase of Andres white paper to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease — the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the term "pandemic" refers to how widespread the disease is, not how dangerous the infection is, the WHO noted the need for governments to do the following:
"""All countries can still change the course of this pandemic."
"If countries say they are detecting, testing, treating, isolating, tracing and mobilizing their citizens in response,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said."
“We are deeply concerned with both the alarming level of spread and severity and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, the director of the former United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in a comment published by CNN in February, “no respiratory virus other than influenza has been tracked continuously since the rise of the virus.”
Gabrielus also expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen anything like this from the coronavirus pandemic."
She continued, "And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The WHO's decision to declare an international public health emergency in January coinciding with the taking of a new situation as a pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said about the outbreak, "The bottom line, it's getting worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 4,600 deaths as a result.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, declared a public health emergency of international interest on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing about 97,000 deaths.
There were about 364,000 people.
The case fatality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while in Algeria globally it ranges from 13.04% to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory stress syndrome.
The time from contact to the onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but this range can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The first treatment is symptomatic and assistive therapy. The recommended prevention measures include hand washing, covering your mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation of people who have been infected.
Officials around the world have reacted by banning travel, quarantine, curfew, workplace risk control and shutting down various facilities.
The global pandemic has led to severe socio-economic disturbances, suspensions or cancellations of sports, religious, political and cultural events, buying hamsters, and the lack of supplies that will further suffer.
Schools and universities have closed nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese nationals, other East and Southeast Asian characters and citizens of the cover, and other people in the region who have had a significant number of cases of the virus.
Due to the reduction in travel and the closure of large industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of pneumonia cases of unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
Most of these cases were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and are therefore considered to have a zoonotic origin of the virus.
The cause of this outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly detected virus that is closely related to the Chamorro coronavirus, the Salk coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first known person to have symptoms was found to have been sick on 1 December 2019 and the person was not related to the latter weight market group.
In a group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, unproven reports from the South China Morning Post suggested that the incident was traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man in Hubei province, it could be the same first case. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that the new cases in China reportedly decreased but the first cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea reported a sudden surge outside China.
The condition may be noticeably less noticeable in people with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of global cases. Patrick Evans, the UK’s leading scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population must be infected before gaining effective batten resistance.
The number of people tested for COVID-19 has been confirmed to be positive, according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland had official policies not to test only those with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and these undocumented infections were the source of infection in 79% of the undocumented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than those reported.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
The majority of people with COVID-19 are healthy.
For those who don't, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, and most commonly 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 people had died due to COVID-19.
In China, on February 5, 80% of deaths were over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to those who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The true number of deaths from COVID-19 may be very high, while it may not include people who have died without testing - such as at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of more deaths in the course of the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we know that [described death] is a miscalculation", a statement according to the least-anticipated non-scientific report in the U.S. This type of underestimated is most likely in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first death was confirmed in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China's mainland was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy, each outside mainland China.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths in each continent except Antarctica. Various measures have been commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the quantity of testing, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, demographic characteristics such as the time and age of the initial outbreak, gender and overall health. The case-to-death ratio shows the proportion of cases that have recovered to the number of deaths over the given time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths and cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the death-to-income ratio is estimated at 17.3% (for those who have started symptoms from 1-10 January 2020) and has decreased to 0.7% (for those who have started symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with any disease and the percentage of non-infectious deaths (IFR), who have died from the disease.
These figures are not based on time and follow a certain population from infection through case resolution.
Many academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The University of Oxford's evidence-based drug estimates that the overall infection mortality rate of the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimates of this category are in line with the results of a statistical study analyzing the effects of the first randomized trial for COVID-19 in Germany and the CFR assessment.
It's all about the ability to control the pandemic.
The duration and duration of the event are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
"The untested, infectious outbreaks are usually lost if the disease-causing organiser is not available,"" said Massey Bonnie of Penn State University."
But it's almost impossible to predict when that will happen.
"The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that all countries could operate to follow the WHO's advice to stop the spread of the virus ""as far as possible""."
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 would "probably spread for a year or two."
"According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, ""physical distancing and other measures are required until a vaccine is available (potentially 18 months or more)""."
“I think this coronavirus—as it moves easily—is less likely to disappear altogether,” said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, “and it can become a seasonal disease by coming back every year.”
The return to the first condition depends on the extent of the disease's immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may not be relatively certain and infected people may not have any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath or production of wrinkles (wrinkles), shortness of breath, shortness of breath, muscle and bone joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood pressure, vomiting, or cyanosis. WHO recommends that about one in six people have severe shortness of breath.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or feeling pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, blurred face or lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to immediately consult a doctor.
Some of these infections may be symptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but the results of the test confirm the infection, so researchers have issued advice that people who have close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and checked to eliminate the possibility of infection.
The proportion of people with no symptoms ranges from 44% to 44%.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and the onset of symptoms) lasts from one to 14 days; it usually lasts five days. In an instance of uncertainty, the proportion of people suffering from COVID-19 disease who lost their ability to swell was initially estimated at 30% but this rate later dropped to 15%.
There are a number of factors that determine how the disease spreads.
The disease is believed to have spread primarily from a small area of production when coughing, sneezing or talking; which is from a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that an uncovered cough can create droplets that can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27) feet.
Some viruses may be transmitted by small droplets that can be produced by speaking, suggesting that they stay in the air for a longer period of time. Breathing droplets can also be produced by breathing, which can also occur, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
They can stay in the mouth or nose of people who are close to or possibly reach the lungs when they are breathing.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolize the secretion of the respiratory tract and thus spread through the air.
It can occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then spreads to the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Worrying that this may spread by this direction, it is believed to reduce the risk.
The Chinese government rejected the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus becomes extremely contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread it before symptoms appear and even in later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease for three days before symptoms began suggesting an infection before they showed significant symptoms.
There have been a small number of confirmed cases in the laboratory, but contact traces have been identified by some countries in the absence of symptomatic cases during the investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was detected in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, in cardboard for a day, and in copper for four hours.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature. Tests for COVID-19 have shown positive results for pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as people infected are washed after contact with other surfaces that may have been touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, previously isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to a group of cases of Wuhan's acute respiratory syndrome.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus appear in the related coronavirus in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus can be killed by household soap, which disrupts its protective structure. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to its original SARS-CoV.
I think it's a genetic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is hereditarily living in groups in the genus Betacoronavirus, the Uppinus sarbikovirus (descendant B) along with a two-chamera-derived attempt.
It is 96% similar to the entire genome level with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference between the viruses of pinoline and the viruses that come from humans in certain parts of the genome sequence.
This full-genome comparison to date has found a maximum of 92% of the genetic content shared between the year-old coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the year-olds are intermediate hosts.
The removal of the infection or reverse transcription of the CT imaging may be finalized by the polymerase chain Reaxon (rRT-PCR), but the diagnosis of the infection by the virus can be made temporarily based on symptoms.
A study comparing CT with PCR suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR but less specific, with many of its graphical features adjusting to pneumonia and other pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT not be used as a first-line test for screening or diagnosis of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaxon (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours.
Usually this test is done on the nasopharyngeal swab while the neck swab can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be widely used.
A serological test developed by Selex in the US was only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of a person's radiograph include feature photography and asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent plural effusions in computed tomography (CT).
The Italian Radiological Society is collecting an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, there is limited specificity in identifying COVID-19 from imaging without confirmation by the PCR.
A large study in China pinned the CT results to PCR and showed that although imaging for infection is less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it to be considered as a screening tool in the epidemiological field.
Both radiographs and CTs have developed artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks to recognize the feature of taking pictures of viruses.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include overall personal hygiene, washing hands, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose and mouth, and spitting and sneezing on tissues, and putting tissue directly in the trash can.
People who are already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to or from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a point of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to communities, and some community members do not know where and how they were infected. Health care providers caring for someone infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
For this purpose, the government's use of location data from mobile phones has signaled privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement asking to set limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or offered for voluntary use and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, using Bluetooth to record their proximity to phone users.
Users receive messages afterwards if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. For example, there are ineffective misconceptions about how to prevent infection, including rinsing the nose or rinsing and rinsing the mouth.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop it.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after people go to the toilet or hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
Because outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
The CDC further recommended the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol in the amount of soap and water not readily available.
Who advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected by many solutions (within a minute of exposure to disinfectant for a thickly inflamed steel surface), which consists of 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% proviron-i
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, bathrooms, shared areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by visitors should be disinfected if any cases of COVID are suspected or confirmed.
Health organizations have recommended that people should cover their mouth and nose with a cloth or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and that any tissue should be handled immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for infected people, as wearing a mask can limit the amount of respiratory droplets and travel distance between them when speaking, coughing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on where and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Wearing a mask can reduce the prevalence of people not touching the face, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene." Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people with the disease.
The WHO recommends wearing masks only when healthy people are at high risk. If they are at high risk, such as people who are taking care of people infected with COVID-19, although they admit that people who wear masks can help not touch their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage people to use face masks.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of cloth. China recommends the use of disposable medical masks especially by healthy members of the public, especially when it comes to close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
People in Hong Kong are advised to wear masks while using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to wear face masks and wash their clothes daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned the use of max and nose coverings when people were in crowded places.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear face masks to protect themselves and others while visiting the public.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, required passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has also made it mandatory to wear face masks when going out, while it has also recommended the production of household face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves the actions of infection control to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The rules include the closure of schools, workplaces, theatres, or shopping centers.
People can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using unconnected greeting, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now obliging or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the disaster.
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if not spread COVID-19 in that area) to 50 people and later reduced to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and contracted immune systems face an increased risk and complications of severe illness while maintaining physical distancing and making it clear that they have been told by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community outbreaks. By the end of March 2020.
The use of the term "social distancing" had the effect of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means rather than engaging in total social isolation in them. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes a recommendation to have sex only with the person you are staying with, who does not have any symptoms of the virus or virus.
People who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspect they have been infected have been advised to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation. Many governments have made self-isolation mandatory or recommended for the entire population residing in the affected areas.
The strictest self-isolation guidelines are issued in high-risk groups.
Anyone who has been in contact with COVID-19 and has recently traveled to a country or region where there is widespread transmission is advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of final possible exposure.
Strategies for disaster control are control or suppression, and mitigation.
Prevention measures are taken in the early stages of the outbreak and are aimed at detecting and isolating those infected, as well as introducing other measures of infection control and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
While it is no longer possible to cover the spread of the disease later, efforts go into the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
The combination of both prevention and prevention measures can be adopted at the same time.
More extreme measures are needed for suppression that can reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of an infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is called leveling the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of adversely affecting health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can manage disasters include measures to prevent personal injury, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling hooligan gatherings; community engagements that led to disasters, such as evacuation and evacuation, to encourage participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning when disasters are to be contained in China.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued warnings about the walking dead of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who placed themselves in quarantine and imposed huge fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and imposed penalties for storing medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show major challenges in mitigation (reducing but preventing the spread of the pandemic) and mitigation (inverting epidemic growth).
Maximal mitigation policies can reduce demand for high health care by 2/3 and death by half, but there are still millions of deaths and health systems are disrupted.
In cases where the virus is spreading in human populations, suppression can be prioritized (or must be maintained until a vaccine is available or has already arrived), because otherwise the contacts may return as soon as the measures are taken.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic are a factor in social and economic costs.
There is no antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Consuming cold medicine easily found in the counter, drinking liquids and relaxing can help reduce the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids can lead to poor results.
Various compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO has also said that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Improving capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the WHO as a fundamental disaster response measure.
The ECDC and the WHO’s European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care to move resources to multiple levels, including focusing on laboratory services to test COVID-19, canceling the selection process, as far as possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and training staff to increase intensive care capabilities and include the number of ventilators and ventilators available to increase the number of ventilators and ventilators available.
There are many theories about where the first case (so-called zero illness) might have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be found in Wuhan, Hubei, China, on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei grew steadily.
Most of these were related to the wholesale market of Huawan seafood, which also sold live animals, and there is a theory that the virus came from one of these different types of animals, or, in other words, the animal has a biological origin. The pneumonia group of unknown causes was observed on December 26 and whose Hubei was treated by Dr. Zhang Jian at the Regional Hospital, which reported on December 27.
"On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital had warned their colleagues of a ""SARS-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police of spreading false rumours, and another eye-phoned by his supervisor on charges of raising alarms.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later published the public information on December 31 and reported it to WHO.
Adequate cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan in early January to begin an investigation. During the initial phase of the outbreak, the number of cases nearly doubled in seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, which were aided by the Chinese New Year's holiday and the location of the Wuhan Transport Hub and major rail exchange.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official statistics show that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy in terms of the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported globally; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have died.
It has a presence in at least 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have banned free movement and established border controls.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities of the implementation of the traffic ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea remarked that when it was "definitely not the WHO's recommendation" that it was "the first time in the WHO's outbreak" it was also "the most important sign of the commitment to preventing the epidemic in that place, where it was declared the most concentrated people in the WHO" and called it "an increase in the country unprecedented in public health history", outside of China on 30 January.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that “particularly in low- and middle-income countries with no robust health systems, PHEIC is due to the risk of global spread.”

Many provincial-level administrators of China's Communist Party (CPC) have been fired because of ways to handle their quarantine efforts in central China, signaling dissatisfaction with the response to the outbreak of political establishments in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the initial approval of the coronavirus that started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the U.S. or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration has described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," with China's "censorship supercharged a virus that has now turned into a global pandemic," which some critics have termed as racial discrimination and an attempt to "distract attention from the administration's failure to control the disease."
"Daily Beast received the U.S. government's cable that outlined a communications strategy that had a clear origin in the National Security Council, citing the strategy as ""everything is about China."""

"The source accused Russia of making ""geopolitical and diplomatic"" attractions ""objectionable""."
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana and the Italian Foreign Minister Lala de Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.

The NATO "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held in reduced standards.
Keith Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it puts at risk not only the lives of soldiers from the United States and many of the countries involved in Europe, but also the lives of the residents of the country they are operating." The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with other current or former political dignitaries as well as nearly two registered members of parliament.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter on 14 March 2020 calling for support to world leaders, stating that his country is struggling with the outbreak due to the lack of access to the international market due to the United States' sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt the most common social policies, including public health, family-level, global health care, and world-view.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
"With Japan announcing that anyone coming from South Korea will be placed in quarantine for two weeks, South Korea has criticized Japan's ""unambiguous and passive quarantine efforts""."
South Korean society was initially polarized for President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions for a call for impeachment of the Moon instead of what they claimed would result in government disarmament of the outbreak or its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by undefined order, to suspend parliament as well as elections, and to punish those confirmed to have spread misinformation in government management of the virus and the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, havoc and disruption in factories and management operations due to the increasing use of equipment globally to fight the outbreak.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical devices due to the increasing consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Many areas have seen a distressed shopping trend that emptied the shelves of food items such as foodgrains, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in supply shortages.
The technology industry in particular has been warning about the delay in the shipment of electrical goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This has led to a 20-fold increase in the normal price and a delay in the supply of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, with the WHO warning that it would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic gave a new opportunity for shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity has created a food shortage in some supermarkets and was then banned by the Australian government. Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan and the upcoming high demand for food products, both regions have been spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade of important products have been successful, avoiding acute food shortages predicted in Europe and North America.
There has not been a major cut in North Italy's significant agricultural output, but the price may also increase, according to industry representatives.
Empty food stalls, including in the city of Wuhan, were seen only temporarily, while Chinese government officials released pork stores to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
There are similar laws in place in Italy requiring food producers to stock up for such emergencies.
According to a media report on March 16, the government's measures to prevent the spread of the virus in the first two months of 2020 caused a huge loss to China's economy and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As China's mainland is a major economy and production hub, this viral outbreak is seen as a threat to generate greater volatility in the global economy.
According to the Economist Intelligence Association, Demaris predicts that the market will remain volatile without a clear picture of possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the impact of the pandemic on global economic growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis has impacted the world's $300<0x2B> billion supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly struggling due to a major drop in oil prices due to a shortage of demand from China.
The global stock market declined on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside China's mainland.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 indicator and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their highest drop since 2008, including a drop of 1,191 points, the most in a single day since the 2007-08 economic crisis.
By the end of the week, all three indexes had ended at less than 10%.
On February 28, the Scope Rating GmbH confirmed China's universal credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
On the basis of coronavirus apprehensions, the stock fell again, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
A lot of people think that economic growth is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Arian praised the timely emergency measures of the central bank and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than they did in the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the worst-affected areas due to restrictions on travel, closure of public places, including travel attractions, and suggestions from governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Kansas, have canceled flights due to low demand, while British regional airlines flyby crashed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at a level never seen before.
Many railway stations and ports have also been closed.
It coincides with the pandemic, which is a major travel season related to the Chinese New Year holiday.
The national and regional governments canceled many of the large crowd gatherings, including the annual New Year's Eve festivities, as well as private companies independently closed their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including traditional fairs, in Beijing's Ferbidon City.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions added New Year's Eve to February 10, with most workplaces instructed not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong had declared a state of emergency by lifting its infectious disease response level, closing all schools until March and cancelling New Year's celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally since the decrease or temporary closure during the operation of the stores.
Travel to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East fell 50-60%.
As a result, there has also been a 33-43% reduction in foot traffic in shopping centers in March compared to February.
Directors of Sleeping Malays around the world cancelled the installation and operation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of the docks as an additional measure. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, this pandemic could have left between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 500,000 people lost their jobs in China.
Most of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have either been stranded at home in the internal provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and a unemployment rate of up to 32%. Millions of Indian immigrant workers (who are paid daily wages) in India have been unemployed since they lost their jobs in the mid 90's. A survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that about 44% of their experience in Spain is in the form of Canadian families.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to a short-term action plan run by a government grant known as kurzbit.
Germany's Short-Term Work Compensation Plan has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, which has impacted the operation of organizations worldwide as well as individuals - both employed and independent.
Arts and culture organizations strive to provide access to cultural heritage in the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to continue their (often public-funded) campaign to support artists as much as possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely as their exhibitions, events and exhibitions were canceled or postponed.
In response, there were intense efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another new and fast-growing result of the disease was the cancellation of religious services, sporting major events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced an uproar. The Vatican has cancelled the celebration of the Holy Week of Rome, which falls during the last week of Lent's Christian mourning period.
Groups of churches have advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday gatherings; some churches have made church services available through radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
After the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed down churches and chapels, and St. Peter's Square evacuated Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services to churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras, and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed pilgrimage sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as its residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most sporting activities, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season and 2019–20 NHL season, have been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date back to 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021.
This has prompted many gamblers to switch to online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concert visits.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have also postponed all exhibitions.
Some artists have discovered new ways on the Internet to continue producing and sharing their creations as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as creating, distributing, and promoting web-based "festivals" for live streaming concerts or artists' performances.
On-line, countless coronavirus-based internet memes have spread as many people have turned to humor and distraction amidst uncertainty.
After the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a growing prejudice against people from China and East Asian countries and from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries, genophobia and racism has been mentioned.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostilities have been seen in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia Pacific regions.
Reports from February (when the majority of incidents were still confined to China) said the Chinese deserved the virus, which has been claimed as a fair retaliation, have recorded the expression of racist sentiments among various groups globally.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also growing in some countries in Africa.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
The Chinese have been assisting them in virus-hit areas, both online and offline.
Following the progress of the outbreak in the new hotspot countries, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may also be subject to skepticism and genophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed petitions to ban Chinese citizens from entering their country to prevent the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseJapan and went viral on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of ethnic abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics calling the post racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators from Ukraine attacked buses from the Ukrainian and foreign displaced Boko Haram to Novosibirsk.
Students from northeastern India, bordering China, and studying in major cities in India, have been found to have experienced the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
"Dilip Ghosh, the state unit president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese had degraded nature and ""that is why God took revenge against them""."
Following this comment, the Chinese consulate in Calcutta condemned it as "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism have been exacerbated by the pandemic against non-Chinese residents, foreigners have been described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "falseness."
Many newspapers have removed some or all of them for coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made available scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect antibodies produced in the presence of the virus and in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is only specified and designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibodies can be used for both identification and population monitoring.
Antibody tests have shown that some people who have this disease have very little to report symptoms or who are asymptomatic.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
As of March 2020, no nation had reliable data on the spread of the virus to its population due to limited testing.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are wide variations in how many have been tested across the country.
This variability is also likely to have a major impact on reported infection mortality, which may be significantly higher projected in some countries.
Unlike real-time transcriptions can be tested on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nesopharyngeal swabs or spam samples, using polymerase chain reaxons (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test with a throat swab is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can be lost in the neck as it grows in the lungs.
Alternatively for infected people tested in the second week, the sample material can then be taken by the suction catheter from the inner airway or used to extract the material (artisan).
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in January 2020 using real-time reverse dispersion polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the Charity of Berlin, and was made the basis for 250,000 kits for delivery by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test by 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 identification kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It explores the ""E"" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses and the RdRp gene associated with SARS-CoV-2. In China, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 is the first company to receive emergency use from China's National Medical Product Management for PCR-CoV-2 Discovery Pest-2019 approved by the Public Health Laboratory-BGI in the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In one of the three genetic tests carried out on the older versions of the test kits, the inconclusive results were due to poor reagents in the CDC of Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 average samples of the day that were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two elements were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and were not considered until state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
This test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics made available nationwide COVID-19 testing as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced; samples must be collected and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test of COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Hepatology and Biotechnology Vector Research Center.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Service Inspection Service. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, the Rochi diagnosis received FDA approval for the test, from which to 3.5 can be performed in high quantities within 24 hours, i.e. from a machine
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the approval for emergency use (EUA) at Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar approvals at Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for testing that would take about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using the amplification technology of equilateral nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to produce 50,000 tests per day to deliver the product. A test developed in Taiwan with the hope of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test, will make the novel coronavirus's nucleocapsid protein (N protein) particularly bind to the monocyclone.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that ""radiographs of the chest are of little diagnostic value at an early stage, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before symptoms appear."""
CT's special features include bilateral multilobar ground-glass ambiguity, including peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, madness, and aggregation increases.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan, the core point of the current pandemic, suggests that although CT's visual characteristics are less specific when overlapping with other pneumonia and disease processes, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology has recommended ""not to use CT for first-stage testing or testing for COVID-19"". As of March 2020, the CDC has recommended PCR for early safety checks."
Part of the infection resistance is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine immunity and to detect infections or symptoms that start at 7 days in individuals on population monitoring. Tests can be performed by Point-up Care (PoCT) at Central Laboratories (CLT).
High-flow automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to do these assessments but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Even if a sample of peripheral is used to follow the immune response for CLT, a sample of peripheral is commonly used.
A blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained from a skin puncture.
An extraction phase different from PCR methods is not required prior to testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 institutions that provided the agency with the information as required and are now able to distribute antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the certification of emergency use. At the end of March 2020, the Euroimun Medical Laboratory's diagnosis and Epitope diagnosis obtained European approval for testing kits that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within an hour and is therefore much faster than the normal PCR assessment of viral RNA.
Antibodies usually appear 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, any antibodies that the UK has purchased were found to be not useful enough.
"Hong Kong has made arrangements for suspected patients to stay at home, ""The emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient"", they will send it back spitting and after some time they will be tested for the virus and get results." The British NHS has announced that it is running a system to test for suspected COVID-19 infections at home, which could lead to infections or other infections in the hospital."
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most detailed tests to any country. In Germany, physicians from the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance said on March 2 that it has the capacity to conduct around 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory setting and that it carried out 10.700 tests in the previous week.
The cost of medical care is determined by the cost of medical care.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the overall capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, tests were offered in many big cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, with only positive results reported.
"The first laboratory survey found that at least 483,295 samples were tested as of calendar week 12/2020, and as of week 12/2020, 33,491 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of 10,000 samples in a single week, and only 5 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2."
The construction, supervised by BGI-founder Wang Jian, and a 5-day morphology of this test capability, showed that Hubei's infections would be 47% higher and the cost would double in line with the quarantine being faced.
The Wuhan laboratory has been implemented in 12 cities of China immediately by Huao-yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As of 4 March 2020, the total regular flow was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplex designs published by Origami Asse, an open source that can test more than 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 Asses, have been published. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid drivers.
As of March, the lack of reagents and inadequate amounts have been a barrier to common testing in the EU and the UK and the US.
It has directed some inventors to explore sampling preparation protocols that include heating samples of up to 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates had tested the coronavirus more people than any other nation and more than its population. It was announced that the measurements had reached a greater level of testing in the population.
"It was through a combination of drive-through capacity and purchasing population-measure federation-flow capacity labs from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" Emergency Exploration Laboratories in China)."
Established in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of operating tens of thousands of RT-PCRs per day and is the first laboratory operating in the world on this scale outside of China.
Various testing methods aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for product kits to allow them to make their own without resources in low-income countries.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol, made by the United States Disease Control Centers, was not available in the United States until 28 January by late testing in China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits in the early outbreak and these countries and Australia were unable to give enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations for testing by health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the widespread availability of South Korea's tests helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Private-sector labs with high testing capacity were built by the South Korean government for many years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization was called upon to prepare testing-related programs as an excellent way to mitigate the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the widespread spread of the virus, high demand for testing led to hundreds of thousands of tests being carried out in private U.S. laboratories, and artificialized supplies of swabs and chemical reactors.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
"In the United States, there were ""errors"" in the test kits made by the CDC; then the government removed complex barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be wrong."
The firm explained that the wrong results could lead to failure to collect samples or to use the kits well.
The Spanish ministry said it would return the wrong results extract kits and replace them with the various test kits provided by Shenzhen BioEG. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be faulty.
"Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> suggested these things to be thrown in the denub. Turkish Health Ministry Ates Kara said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China have ""high error rates"" and that the UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China ""not used""."
People who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive for COVID-19 and those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were found to be positive.
Researchers working on the site of Italy's first death from COVID-19 in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2> conducted two series of tests in the overall population of about 3,400 people in the middle of about ten days.
Almost half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all the infections detected were kept in quarantine.
It completely eliminated the new infection, including a ban on travel to the community.
With aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is much less than in other developed countries, but more restrictions are being enforced without the closure of restaurants and retail businesses.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened after the March 23 holiday.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic, including pandemic contact tracing, inbound transit prevention, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that compared to the number of deaths that countries have tested more, their fatal infection rates have been found to be very low, possibly because these countries are very well able to detect infections in people who have mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience about COVID-19 to send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO-referenced laboratories for testing.
Of the 16 refineries, there are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"In the film given below, the ""positive tests as %"" column has been influenced by the country's testing policy."
A hospital in a country that only tests people who are hospitalized has a higher percentage of positives than a country that tests all citizens, whether they are showing symptoms or not, other things are the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing your hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms or other unnecessary substances.
Washing hands with soap regularly at some "important times" of the day prevents the transmission of many diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera that are transmitted through the rectal-faced route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza and rheumatism, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucus membranes).
There are five critical moments when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission from the fecal-mouth of the disease during the day: before and after exfoliation, after cleaning the bottom of the baby or changing the baby's diapers, before feeding, before and after preparing food and running raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands can be cleaned with ashes if soap and water are not available. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after treatment for a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who used the toilet.
If you have a cough, cough or sneeze.
After feeding animals, animals, or animals.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands with pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can lead to disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
It is important for people who run food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important exercise for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of avalanche; reducing respiratory infections;
reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing studies could lead to minor improvements in the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the infant mortality rate can be reduced by introducing small behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This normal function can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by about 50%.
The intervention to promote handwashing can reduce the incidence of the ash by about three-thirds and can be compared with the function of providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of low-fat episodes may be associated with soapy handwashing. Soapy handwashing is one of the most effective and easy ways to prevent acute and severe respiratory infections (ARIs) according to self-treatment performed at home, school, and community-wide locations.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the cause of the death of an estimated 1.8 million children each year among children under the age of five.
Pneumonia and diarrhoea are responsible for the deaths of 3.5 million children.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet in the ingrown banyan can save more lives than with any form of vaccine or medical intervention, preventing about half of all deaths from avalanches and about one-quarter from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually collected by other cleaning interventions as part of water, sanitation and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against wrinkles that are spread by direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage to the dead skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing, hand eczema, or a letter of skin called hand dermatitis can lead to problems. This is especially the case with healthcare workers.
Hand washing is also one of the symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
During the day, there are five critical times when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission from the feces of the disease: after using the bathroom (pissing, diarrhea), after cleaning the bottom of the baby (changing the baby's diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or before/after running chicken, fish or poultry.
Other conditions to be followed before and after the treatment of a bite or wound; after coughing, coughing or sneezing from the nose; after touching animal feces or running animals; and after touching dirt.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 study conducted on hand washing in 54 countries found 38.7% of households practicing hand washing with soap on average. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; about moderate 77 percent in the United States; and the lowest 23 percent in China. Many behavioral changes appear to be an increase in the number of people who adopt hand washing with soap at critical moments. There seems to be an increase in the group of people who decide to set up a school for hand washing.
The "Important Healthcare Program" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of scale work promoting children's health and education.
It is a key part of the national program to treat chronic constipation twice a year, supply soapy daily handwashing, and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main actions of soaps and detergents are to increase the swelling to reduce the barriers in the solution.
Water alone is insufficient to clean the skin because smooth and proteins, which are organic soil elements, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, the work of washing is supported by a significant flow of water.
Due to its reusable nature, solid soap can hold the bacteria obtained from previous uses.
Few studies that have studied bacterial transfers from contaminated solid soaps have determined that there is no possibility of transfers due to bacterial fungus.
The CDC continues to say that "liquid soap is suitable for handling hand-washing."
High levels of antibacterial soap have been promoted for health-conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants makes the choice for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of organisms' resistant efforts.
Therefore, even if antibiotics are not resistant to antibiotics by soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surface and skin protection agents, sophisticated constructions also contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin-condensing agents that contain antimicrobial enzymes.
Hand washing is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow at a temperature of 37 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
However, it is believed that soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, unlike the well-known belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water to reduce microbial loads on the hands has no effect.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizer agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubber, antiseptic hand rubber or hand sanitizers) began gaining popularity.
Many are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol made with thickening agents such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) in a gel or glycerin-like humectants or foams in liquid to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding FICA-made hydrogen-peroxide still increases further microbial activity. Hand sanitizers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol containing alcohol is found to kill bacteria 99.97% (less than 3.5 lbs, equal to 35 decibels less) in the hand after 30 seconds of use and 1 minute of use is found to kill bacteria from 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 lbs less). Hand sanitizers are less effective against bacteria and some more effective against bacteria.
Hand sanitizers based on alcohol are almost universally ineffective against norovirus (or narvalc) types of viruses, a very common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol rubber must be used to soak or cover both hands well.
Both the front and back of the hand and between the fingers and the side are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
In both cases, the fingertips need to be washed thoroughly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand sanitizer when hands are normally dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their easy use and intense killing activity against microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing until soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can make the skin dry until subcutaneous and/or skin moisturizers are not in the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients rather than soaps or antimicrobial detergents reduce skin irritation and dryness.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact arthritis, or high sensitivity to alcohol or other components present in the alcohol hand rub.
There was a lower chance of getting erect contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the organic content of the hands, usually disinfecting them.
This is due to the fact that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the transmission of many pathogens as they remain in the hands of pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily based on ingredients and formulas and has historically been particularly functional alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol that was shown to reduce the effectiveness of repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions, formulas using benzalconium chloride were shown to have continued and stored antimicrobial activity after application.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford to buy soap and use ashes or clay instead.
Water can be more effective than ashes or clay, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is that if soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase sleep rather than reduce the transmission of the disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it makes an alkaline solution in contact with water.
The WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The right hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of transmission of the disease includes:
Soak your hands in warm or cold water.
It is recommended that the water flowing due to the inaccurate basins can be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to vary.
Wash your hands with a large amount of soap and rub your hands behind the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands when using soap than when using only water.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
Mitch creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and for a longer period of time, Mitch removes even more germs.
Wash well with boiling water.
Washing hands in the basin can be contaminated again.
Make sure you have a clean towel or dry it.
Cold and oscillating hands can be easily re-contaminated. Most of the areas that are exempt are under the ageing finger, nose, area between the fingers and the nail.
Artificial nails and cut nails can provide shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to protect hands from dryness; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Low-cost alternatives can be made to make hand washing easier in areas where running water and/or soap are not available, such as digging water from the proper holes in the hung jerrycan or flames and using ash if necessary in developing countries. In cases of limited water supply (schools in developing countries and rural areas), there are other "water-conserving solutions" such as
A volatile edge is a world hanging by a rope, a simple technique used by foot lifters and soap pieces to pour less amount of water into the hands.
Under the hand washing process, drying hands effectively is mandatory. But there is some controversy over which is the most effective method of drying hands in public toilets.
An increasing amount of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than electric hand dryers found in many calves.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and a more modern jet-air hand dryer, and it was sponsored by the paper towel industry European Tissue Symposium.
Washing hands and drying with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to have increased by 194% in the finger pad and 254% in the hatch.
Drying the jet-air dryer led to a 42% increase in the total number of bacteria in the finger pad and 15% in the hitch.
After washing hands with paper towels, the bacteria were reduced by an average of 76% in the fingerpad and 77% in the hatch. Scientists have also conducted tests to find out whether each type of drying method is likely to result in other calves users and the order of the calf environment being contaminated.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow up micro-organisms and units by hand and potentially contaminate the environment of other toilet users and toilets up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of microbes. In 2005, different hand drying methods were evaluated in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt.
The following changes were observed in the bacteriological calculation after drying of the hands:
Many hand dryer manufacturers exist and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Washing hands using hand sanitizing wipes is an option when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
A hand sanitizer based on alcohol should contain at least 60% alcohol.
This became mandatory in 1846 after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the effectiveness of medical hand washing to prevent disease within the environment of the colon.
Hospital staff have electronic devices that provide feedback to remind them to wash their hands.
A study found that their use decreased infection rates.
Medical hand washing should also be done for at least 15 seconds, in which a sufficient amount of soap and water is used to flush out each part of the hand by removing the fungus.
Hands must be tied together with the interlocking of the digits.
If the finger nails are dirty, the bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since the germs can stay in the water of the hands, it is important to ask it with a clean towel and well-washed.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again from the surface.
The purpose of hand-washing in a health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing work has been unacceptable levels in many medical environments, while a large number of physicians and nurses are regularly forgetting to wash their hands after touching patients, so microbes will spread.
One study found hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a standard hand washing and handwashing paper in the health care sectors.
The organization's draft guidelines on hand hygiene can be found on its website for public comment.
A review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Traders can measure and validate hand hygiene if the performance of regulatory compliance is required.
There are "five minutes" for hand washing with the World Health Organization:
After coming into contact with blood/body fluids
Aseptic Work Before
After the incubation period. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soaps ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soaps) provides killing action in the hand-washing agent.
Before surgery or in settings where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are highly prevalent, it can be a death wish function. For surgical operations, the person's hands are 'scrolled', the hands are 'scrolled on and off', the hands are scrounged on and off, the hands are scrounged on and off, some are steered by chlorhexidine or iodine odors, the sterile towels and brush to dry the hands.
We need to get rid of all the bugs.
This procedure usually requires washing your hands and feet for 2 to 6 minutes.
It doesn't take long (about 10 minutes).
You need to keep the water out of your hands to keep the water out of your hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and applied to the surgical gown.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after getting close to a sick person or use a hand antiseptic.
For the control of staffilecoccal infections in hospitals, the most benefit of hand-washing came from washing the first 20% and the additional benefit was found to be much less after the hand-washing frequency reached above 35%.
Plain soap wash results in more than three times the rate of spread of bacterial infectious disease in food than smoked antibacterial soap. Alcohol-based solution hand washes compared to handwashing for an average time of 30 seconds. Compared to handwashing with antibacterial soaps, each one contains more than 26% more alcohol handwashing antibacterial soaps.
But a handheld virus and chloridium diphenyl spore H1N1 are more effective in reducing influenza than alcohol-based hand rubs. Resistance to improving hand hygiene in healthcare settings involves educating employees in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs and including written and verbal warnings to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare locations.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is known to be effective, including essential equipment and good nutrition to achieve good health.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools, and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve an all-encompassing hand washing behavior.
For example, although there are cheaper options to build hand washing stations in many rural Africa, it is rare to have a hand washing stream near every private or public toilet.
However, lower hand washing rates can also be the result of active habits, not due to a lack of soap and water.
The promotion and support of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and change the behaviour of the population over a long period of time.
It is essential to monitor, monitor and evaluate effectively.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based access to LMICs is more effective when social marketing campaigns are less effective. Examples of hand washing promotions in schools are “access to schools that encourage normal, easy-to-use steps” given by UNICEF to ensure students wash their hands with soap together with other hygiene needs.
When the minimum grades are achieved, schools can be moved from one to three stars to the ultimate.
Handwashing stations in the building can be part of campaigns to be implemented to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to succeed in behavioral change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis.
Some students thought about the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALYs risk.
However, a review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and hygiene interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people at risk such as newly born mothers or hospitalized wounded soldiers – was initially discovered in the mid-19th century by two researchers in hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale.
At that time, many people still believed that infections were caused by a dirty smell called misogyny.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of the swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness of the importance of washing hands with soap in many countries to make themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "right hand washing methods" were hung near the toilets of hand washing sinks and office buildings in public toilets and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands" in a thing means declaring that no one is willing to be responsible for the thing or share the complexity of it.
It begins with a passage from the Bible about Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands when he decided to hang Christ on the cross, but it has become a more widely used phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands forcibly in an attempt to purge the stain conceived of by her husband in connection with the crimes he has been arrested and charged with.
After a consultation or experimental work, people have also found that they want to wash their hands more often and give more recognition to hand washing devices.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after consideration are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" compensatory tasks such as volunteering.
Religions suggest handwashing for both cleaning and symptomatic purposes. In many areas of symptomatic handwashing, using handwashing water but not using soap is part of handwashing as a culture that practices Bahai faith, Hinduism, Judaism’s Tewilah and Neilat Yadaim, Christianity’s Lavabo and Islam’s work after washing hands are also presented in many religions, including the practice of washing hands.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims use the toilet to wash their hands.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, washing of hands before and after eating is considered mandatory every time.
Risk management in the workplace for COVID-19.
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methods for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate controls of risk to be made in the workplace are based on risk assessments of risk sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of employees who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk tasks have minimal professional contact with the general public and other employees, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand-washing, encouraging employees to stay at home when they are sick, maintaining respiratory etiquette and disinfecting the working environment.
Moderate contact risk activities include people who have not been detected or suspected of COVID-19, but who need frequent or close contact with people who may be infected due to ongoing community or international travel.
This includes school, high-population-density work environments and workers who are in contact with the masses in some high-volume retail settings.
The risk controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, hawk guards and the task of providing personal protective equipment in the event of a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health care and morgue workers at risk of COVID-19, which increases the risk of high exposure to aerosol-producing processes by workers who collect or handle samples from people who have or are suspected of COVID-19.
Proper risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative arc ventilation rooms and personal rescue equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 can have a variety of impacts on the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work when they are sick, needing to take care of other people or fearing potential contact.
Business structures may change both on the basis of demanded goods and the means of receiving these goods (such as shopping or delivery or drive-through services during off-peak times).
In the end, the seeding of objects from the highly affected geographic areas may have been disrupted by COVID-19. Infectious disease readiness and response plan can be used to guide the moving of protective measures.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with a variety of workspaces and employment tasks, including risk factors arising from contact sources, home and community settings, and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or severe medical conditions.
They also require outline controls to address those risks and uncertain plans for situations that may arise as a result of props.
Infectious disease preparation and response plans may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Objectives for disaster response include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, organizing professional actions, and minimizing adverse effects on other organizations in the supply chain.
The seriousness of the disease in the business-based community has an impact on the responses to be taken.
A hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to put risk controls in one group by effectiveness.
While the risks of COVID-19 are not eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrative controls and, lastly, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls work to keep workers away from the risks associated with workers without relying on labor practices and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that are required to be performed by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some contacts.
All types of PPE workers must be selected on the basis of risk, appropriately applied (e.g., respiratory tract), regularly and well applied, regularly inspected, repaired and replaced, and well removed, cleaned, and stored or contaminated.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), there is a minimum of professional contact with the general and other peers of low infection risk actions.
Recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and well-maintained hand washing, encouraging employees to stay at home when they are sick, covering when coughing or sneezing, using respiratory protocols, including handwashing and handwashing, cleaning and disinfecting equipment and disinfecting garbage boxes, telecommuting (work at home) or orderly shredding of staff and equipment, if necessary.
The immediate identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, and other people in the workplace.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory illnesses stay at home for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-aware medications. These leave policies ranging from alertness to alertness and allowing employees to stay at home to care for sick family members.
According to the OSHA, moderate infection risk actions include people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to frequent or close contact with patients who have COVID-19 or are suspected, but who have recently traveled internationally due to an ongoing community infection around the business location or a person who has been infected with COVID-19.
This includes schools, high-volume-density work environments and some high-volume retail settings such as contacts with the general public, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits, not-for-profits.
Workers in this risk group need to use rare respirators.
When a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect employees and other passengers include keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from other people, appointing a group member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or urging the sick person to cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
The crew must wear disposable medical equipment when touching the sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent coughing, or difficulty breathing.
Panja and other manageable items should be managed in a biohazard bag and then disinfected by cleaning the contaminated surfaces. In commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, there is a delay in travel and self-isolating when sick, and immediately alerting the control center if someone is on board with fever or other symptoms.
Ideally, the medical follow-up should be in the person’s cabin. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean and disinfect the community spread if the infected person is in the school building.
When there is a minimum to medium community infection, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as field visits, cancellations of meetings and other large gatherings such as physical education or singing classes or dinners in a cafeteria, increasing the space between the tables, limiting the time between arrival and departure, limiting non-potential visitors and using a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as flu.
Spread notably in the local community, social distancing strategies as well as extended school dismissals can be considered. For law enforcement personnel who perform daily activities, the then-health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that law enforcement officials or people suspected of having COVID-19 should follow guidelines such as emergency medical technology, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
When in close contact during a period of apprehension, workers must disinfect their duty belts and gears by disinfecting them before using a home cleaning spray or wipe again and comply with standard operating procedures to control and manage the used PPE and to keep and wash clothes.
OSHA considers that some healthcare and mortuary workers are in a high or very high category of risk.
High contact risk tasks include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
If workers perform aerosol production processes, they are at very high risk, or collect or control samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing processes include intubation cough ingestion process bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sample collection.
High-risk mortuary operations include workers preparing the bodies of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of their death or with suspected infection; they are at a very high risk in the section they have undergone autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risky groups include aerosol-producing cells for those who have been diagnosed with or suspected of COVID-19.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and mortuary settings.
Biosafety level 3 precautions should be followed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) keeps visitors isolated in isolated waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected of COVID-19 or not. In addition to other PPE, OSHA has detected SARS-CoV-2 or tested it to recommend people working within 6 feet of infected patients and reacting to aerosol-building procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better devices should be used in the material of a written respiratory protection program that involves a sense of fit-testing, training, and medical tests.
Other types of respirators can improve the comfort of the staff by providing much better protection. The WHO does not recommend wearing a cover for respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, which can be transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends only surgical masks for the entry-point testing of employees.
Collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures, for those who are caring or riding, the WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or face coverings, gowns and gloves.
If the aerosol-producing process is completed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Taking care that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, the WHO uses telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, direct care only to allow people with COVID-19 patients to enter the room, using PPE only when it is necessary for special operations, using PPE to reduce the need for masking and screening of people who are exposed to PPE, while taking care of multiple patients who have been diagnosed with the same disease, continuing to monitor PPE to use the same respiratory.

We are in a very difficult situation this month.
There is something in the COVID-19 pandemic that makes our interconnectedness and our responsibilities towards each other clearer.
We don't have the previous example for its challenges, but our best answer lies in the category of global empathy, cooperation and community building that we know resides at the heart of this organization.
The harmony and care we have seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and chats is to establish the incredible truth that we have been fortunate enough to work with amazing people.
I couldn't be more grateful and grateful to all of you as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared his appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how meaningful Modin is for the world now and how powerful it is to stay online and be available to all for this important resource.
Your work makes it possible for you to stay on the Sites or to be paid by our colleagues or to keep our communities safe.
Today, the world needs more information than ever before.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this goal and your role in it, we are going to make some important adjustments in how we work together starting this coming week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, we met last night to discuss our accessibility and to make a table for days and months to come.
In that conversation, we thought that what we thought would be the appropriate responses to what we are facing and would be the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this time.
At the very least, we want to de-stress and support our goals for the long term.
You're going to have to pull it off again, okay?
For all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Our regular working expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you're able to work for more normal time, you can join in on the goal.
However, the world is currently unpredictable and whether you should take care of your favorite person, bring groceries or visit a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We haven't tracked your time.
When you're sick, don't work.
It wasn't meant to be, but we're talking about it.
No sick day or PTO is required - help the team to modify the calendars and tables by telling your manager to make sure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, please let Brian know within the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with the support and make sure that your situation has been properly taken care of by the management).
The person who works for the hour will be paid in full.
We have already told our contractual and hourly employees to respect our commitments and reaffirm it.
Under normal circumstances, everyone will be paid on the basis of the regular hours they worked.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work with us, we will work with you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress in the world around us.
Especially in the midst of such a time gap, the work we do can be incredibly rewarding.
Again, it's about self-esteem.
Our request is that you talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security and Fundraising Teams (among others) do important work that may need further support.
We begin the process in all departments to evaluate the current objectives and focus our attention on supporting what is needed for our goals.
There is enough work to be done for all of us, we only focus on the more urgent projects.
There will be no more pain after healing.
"We don't want it to be the ""second time"" after the global pandemic."
You don't want to spend more time working to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines in the appropriate place.
What's up with the annual report?
In order to adjust our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we would like to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that will allow employees to be required or want to work in a shorter amount of time while adjusting the budget to what will be needed or desired in the next few weeks, while providing critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones.
The extension of this time frame greatly reduces the workload of the current plan and the pressure of the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and we will update the representatives and teams in the next step as soon as we have the approval.
Thank you for the app for your leadership.
The location of the office, contact and cleaning
Last week, we found out that one of our SF-based colleagues was at risk for COVID-19.
However, beyond the abundance of caution, we have put in place a virus-resistant cleaning group to make all surfaces of the San Francisco office infectious.
They used hospital-level anti-viral solutions to disinfect lobby and elevator to reach each surface as well as our floor,
The building is deploying products using its duty-attentive protocols that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel that this office is well prepared when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which is shared with us and all DC-based staff members on its COVID-19 protocols.
Until last week, our DC office went on a full-fledged setup under the guidance of a partnership with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues found out, we also discussed about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These changes will continue, but they can be avoided.
Some of our employees are working from the very beginning.
Our long-term remote colleagues know that this can be adjusted and you can give some suggestions.
Limit the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, consider how they can be divided into multiple day courses.
Explain clearly about the meeting, receive the agenda and send the text materials in advance.
Create predefined videos via devices such as Google Docs and Zoom to get direct support and convenience in connection.
Get the leadership of someone to make each meeting easier, monitor the chat for questions and track a list of speakers and help someone take notes (or act on a collaborative note).
Send an e-mail to the support team if you need help.
Make use of your well-being reimbursement for the food.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking at a webinar-based ergonomics guide to support the growth of distributed work at the foundation.
This week, we urge all communities to allow recipients to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored events such as Editathons until the WHO announces that the pandemic is coming to an end.
We told them that our request for cancellation or other sanctions could make it impossible to carry out his agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be punished for delaying or modifying the objectives.
This week we will follow additional guidelines with Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The common sense around the global community seems to be both distressed by the disruption but relieves the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and elsewhere.
Moving forward, CRT is working to set up a page in Meta-Wiki to give the community a place to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Be aware of issues related to COVID-19.
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We're going to spend some time sharing more updates, answering your questions, and connecting with each other.
We are together and we are here to help.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and find all other necessary COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about your travel, event, major workflow or coverage challenge or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to inform the CRT or work with the CRT.
We are ready to provide support and support as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please email the Director of HR International Global Operations - Brian Judan.
None of these changes will be considered as a relinquishment of our duties and responsibilities.
Instead, they are a recognition that it will be necessary to adapt our work and responsibilities in this country in a way that we have not done in the past.
These are steps we need to take to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our activities in support of what they need, and engage in the service they rely on.
The time will come when our planned work will be waiting for us.
For now, it's time to support each other and make room for important work that's coming up in a week and possibly a month.
We need all of you to do that and that is why we all need to take care of you and your family so that when the need increases, you are at your best.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the remaining members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Ryan A, Ryan To)
B'angiotensin-converted enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestinal cells.
ACE2 targets promising drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, resists activity related to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7). ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converted enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing enzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal collectorin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type of eye membrane protein, its enzymatically active domain is exposed to the surface of the lungs and other fibrous cells.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheds and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually absorbed into the urine.
ACE2 is located in many organs: ACE2 is mainly involved in the alveolar cell of type II of the lungs, the interocyte of the small intestine, the arterial and venus endothelial cells, and in many organs the arterial simple muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter balance on ACE.
ACE attaches the angiotensin I hormone to the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 with turnover connects carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is called the vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr).
ACE2 can also divide into many other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-Bradikinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane smuggling of the carrier SLC6A19 of neutral amino acids and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point to the cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS-CoV-producing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the following virus for COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the endosomes located within the virus and the cells.
This penetration process requires the priming of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic one. It has come up with the hypothesis that a decrease in levels of ACE2 in some cells can help fight the infection.
However, various professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy be continued.
"The systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that ""the use of ACE inhibitor was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in particular compared to control""."
In addition, patients treated with ACE resistant, especially those at high risk of pneumonia and heart failure, also had a lower risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in deaths associated with pneumonia, although the result was less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is indicated to have novel therapy for acute lung injury and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory difficulty syndrome appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of the work is 30 minutes in addition to the course of 24 hours of effect (period).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to the old renin-angiotensin system resistant (RAS resistant) or those with increased disease of the operation of angiotensin II. Soaked rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory stress syndrome.
"B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help in the process of contact tracing, i.e., identifying people who may have come in contact with infected persons (""Contacts"") in connection with the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic."
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been developed to build contact tracing apps.
In particular, privacy concerns have been raised about systems based on the task of tracking the geographic location of the app users.
The less-interfering options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log close to the user on other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will integrate the Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, in conjunction with Alipay, the Chinese government has developed an app for citizens to check if they have come into contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, the app called TraceTogether is being used.
"This app was developed by the local IT community, which is published as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched ""StopKorona!""", a Bluetooth-based app that tracks people who have come in contact with potentially infected people and provides a quick response to healthcare officials."
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government's contact tracing app was in advanced development stage and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. A similar app is planned in Ireland and France (""StopCovid"")."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce the geofencing app designed to ensure that patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of possible practical problems with the app-based system, as well as a potential lack of false positives and effectiveness if the app's use is limited to a small fraction of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of misinformation or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple sets limits what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, for which they are restricted to ""official"" or prestigious organizations."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed their concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially as they expressed concern about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be demolished after the threat of the coronavirus pandemic has broken out.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organization announced eight conditions in government projects:
"Monitoring must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate"";"
The sun's rays are visible in the eyes and eyes;
The use of the data must be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance will not allow discrimination and marginalization to be intensified.
Any sharing of data with third parties must be mentioned in the law;
Citizens will have the right to defend themselves against abuse and abuse.
"Substantial participation by all ""relevant stakeholders"", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also released checklists."
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of long-term monitoring by removing the tracing process from its device's operating systems after it is no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protected systems have been created that use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, non-app based systems were used to trace contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card business data, and combined them to produce information through text messages to potentially-infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available, some of which have been allowed due to changes in the information privacy rules implemented after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public via some apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, considered using both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been revealed.
Privacy-protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with sufficient bodies in research literature since at least 2013 before. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log user proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-functional effort that involves both centralized and decentralized access and which is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preserving tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact incident numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and other contact tracing for mobile contacts (PA).
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leave the device, and all are on matching devices.
SafePaths is developing a platform to use privacy group privacy reservation measures in the MIT Media Lab when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
"This is based on research published in March 2020 on ""Apps Gone Disease: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Pandemic""." Another such effort is the secure platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology that was originally established at the MIT Media Laboratory."
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology without compromising data privacy with other users and authorities to share sensitive location and health data to users.
On April 5, 2020, Global TCN was founded by coalition groups that adopted a broad-based approach and broadly accessed around overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and an important aspect to enable global interaction that tracks and alerts applications.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app is open source.
On April 10, 2020, Android announced a proposal for contact tracing by Google and Apple, the companies that control iOS mobile platforms, in which they claimed to protect privacy based on the bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protected cryptography configuration.
They have also published the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be completed in three stages:
Rollout of tools that enable governments to create official privacy-protected coronavirus tracing apps
By distributing the system through the first operating system updates, and removing it in the same way once the threat is triggered afterwards, the organization of this functionality is planned to directly address the problems of adoption and continuous monitoring on iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple.
b'Restatement of the drug (also known as re-purposing, re-profiling, re-functioning or therapeutic switching) is initially intended to replace the approved drug to treat a different disease or health condition that has been developed.
This is a line of scientific research that is currently being followed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 dragable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyze binding sites to provide appropriate projects to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19-related proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papen-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helices, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphates.
Hussain AA, et al. studied several promising compounds that were analyzed in line with the highest-compatible drugs for their skeletal similarity in that a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug can be suggested in the design of his clinical studies to accelerate the development.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug also used against some autoimmune diseases.

New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA made it official to use hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under accidental use certification (EUA).
Treatment is not accepted by the FDA's process of clinical trials and has only been approved under the EUA as a diagnostic treatment for accidental use in hospitalized patients and has not been able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
"The CDC says that ""the duration of hydroxychloroquine for use, quantity, or profilaxis, or the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been established."
"Doctors have said they use the drug ""when there is no other option""."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are in the process at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is testing the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shanghai have claimed that Favipiravir was ""clearly effective""."
On an average of 4 days, 35 patients tested negative, while in 45 patients the duration of the illness was up to 11 days who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half received umphenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency noted that the evidence in support of the drug to the public is short and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has informed the Trump administration about how to buy the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases that the virus has already spread.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
"The combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, a study of lopinavir/ritonavir (caletra) concluded that ""no benefit was observed""."
Drugs were designed to prevent HIV from being replicated by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify drugs to find compounds that bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There have been criticisms within the scientific community about the resources directed at rethinking drugs specifically designed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included Lopinavir/Retonavir in the International Unity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Science later found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona-viruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies have shown that the restriction on remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier. Various clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, continue; one for moderately ill people and the other for more severe people.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with COVID-19 and seriously ill; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and no controlled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and did not need to be hospitalized even if they experienced mild symptoms.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Various antibiotics are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting Italian drug agencies to publish use instructions.
On April 14, a multicenter study on 300 patients who were researching the use of Enoxaparin Sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses in Italy was announced.
Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, scientific attention has been focused on rethinking accepted anti-viral drugs that were developed for pre-exposure such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 as per the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially recombinant as a COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor) approved by China.
As well as testing in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The ACOVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Even if no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many efforts are in progress to develop such vaccines.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in the safety studies of Phase I in April.
COVID-19 was diagnosed in December 2019.
The spread of outbreaks around the world in 2020 has led to research activities to make thoughtful investments and vaccines.
Many organizations are using published genomes to make possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As mentioned in April, the essentials for the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, deployment to large complexes and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform goals include the first phase of the safety study:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccinated Person: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others announced, but with little public available information (planned or projected) are at an early stage of development.
When determining more accurate, effective doses, the Phase I-II trial conducts initial safety and immunity tests, which are usually irregular, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations.
Inspecting for adverse effects that occur in the maximum dosage involves more participants, including the control group and the test effectiveness of the vaccine, in phase III trials.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were still not in the human evaluation (still in "pre-medical" research).
In Australia, on January 24, 2020, the School of Queensland announced that it was genetically modifying the viral proteins that triggered an immune response that it was investigating the possibility of a nuclear clamp vaccine.
Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada announced that it would begin work on the vaccine, aiming to start human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.

On March 12, 2020, the biotechnology company in Medicago, Quebec City, reported the development of particle-like coronaviruses under the partial funding of the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, whose human trials are planned for July or August 2020.
"Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered ""a large sum of money for special access to the COVID-19 vaccine"" to Curaçao, which the German government opposed."
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, was recently expected to begin clinical trials in April 2020 along with clinical trials.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that their pre-clinical testing results were out in April 2020, and that their final vaccine prayer could begin human trials from the fruit.
On 19 March 2020, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium, which included total investment of US$29 million in institutional Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh and CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curriculum, Innovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, University of Racine.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20 that they had developed a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In the last phase of March, the Canadian government announced a funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects related to medical counter measures against COVID-19, including several vaccine participants at Canadian companies and universities such as the Initiative of Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for developing COVID-19 vaccines with plans to build a national "Choop Bank" of various new vaccines that can be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
"On 2 April 2020, ""Reactions to potent antigen-specific antibody revealed of SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that became apparent in the early 2 weeks after the MNA vaccine was administered [in mosquitoes] were reported by researchers at the Pittsburgh School of Medicine."
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of the DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nail spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce particles such as harmless viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities created resources to access supercomputers from IBM combined with the cloud that computes resources extracted from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-special effects called heterologous effects.
This means that they can get the benefits of preventing diseases themselves.
A total of 4,170 healthcare workers have been recruited for further randomization tests in Australia.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective in development.
Preliminary research evaluating vaccine effectiveness using COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mosquitoes, other laboratory animals and non-human male-animals indicates the need for 3 biological safety-level monitoring measures to handle direct viruses to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preservative vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
While MERS was prevalent, existing SARS research was believed to provide useful templates for making vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that carried out clinical trials of Phase I in humans, and three others are in the process, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two having adenoviral-vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one having MVA-Vactor (MVA-V).
Social media posts have encouraged conspiracy to claim that the COVID-19 virus was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by posts on various social networks refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other breeds of coronaviruses such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and sneezing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, swelling, neck pain, odor loss, and abdominal pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can be in the range of two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases bring about mild symptoms, some improvements in viral pneumonia and the result of multi-part failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths in 210 countries and territories.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus primarily spreads among people during close contact, most often by coughing, coughing or speaking.
When these insects are produced by exhaling, they usually fall to the ground or other surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth after touching a contaminated surface.
The virus can survive on these surfaces for up to 72 hours.
Although the symptoms may spread before and during the later stages of the disease, it is most contagious for the first three days after the symptoms have been seen. The level method of diagnosis is real-time reverse polymerase chain reaxon (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
It is recommended to use masks by those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendation for the use of masks by the general public varies, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or special antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
All WHO regions have recorded the local prevalence of the disease in most countries.
A person infected with the virus may not show symptoms and develop flu symptoms such as fever, coughing, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressures, confusion, difficulty getting up, and things that are blue on the face and lips; immediate medical attention should be taken if these symptoms are present.
Less likely, there may be symptoms related to upper respiratory tract, such as coughing, watering from the nose or throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as wheezing, vomiting and wheezing, have appeared in different percentages.
Some of the cases in China initially showed chest pains and vibrations.
In some cases, the disease can develop into pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but the range can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all people who develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people showing no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting 20% of all confirmed cases showing no symptoms in their hospital stays.
China's National Health Commission began attaching symptoms to daily cases on April 1; 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) did not have symptoms at the time of testing.
Ducks and ducks can carry more viral loads.
It's more common in the church than in the church.
A study in Singapore has found that uncovered cavities can reach up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus usually does not come from the air, the National Institute of Science found positive samples for viral RNA when it was possible to transmit baroaerosols and collect air placed outside of people's rooms.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions that are aerolyzed and therefore transmit airborne diseases.
While there are concerns that it may spread from the feces, it is believed that the risk is minimal. When people are symptomatic, the virus is most contagious; when it is possible to spread before symptoms occur, the risk is minimal.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus lives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was detected on cardboard one day, in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days and in 99% copper for four hours.
However, it varies depending on temperature and humidity.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used correctly; the soap manufacturer reduces the fatty protective net of the virus by inactivating it as well as emptiing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, sputum samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six pauses, the first sample showed the highest viral load and the sixth pause showed the highest viral load when tested on the second day.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, previously isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory illnesses.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 in nature are seen in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the actual SARS-CoV.
The virus is more affected by COVID-19 due to access to host cells through the more abundant enzyme angiotensin-conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the type II alveolar of the lungs.
The virus uses special surface glycoproteins (peplomers) called "spikes" to connect to ACE2 and enter host cells.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of hospitalized people have a serious heart attack but are often diagnosed with a serious disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammable response and immune system disorders during the period of disease progression but can also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart of acute myocardial injury.
ACE2 receptors appear high in the heart and are attached to the heart.
ICU patients with COVID-19 infection have been found to have a high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venus thromboembolism (25%) and may be associated with weak prognosis. Autopsy of people who have died from COVID-19 has caused Diffusion Alveolar Damage (DAD) and inflammatory intravenous intravenous lymphocytes.
SARS-COV-2 is a tropism for the ACE2-sensitive epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, with symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation in patients with severe COVID-19.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-removal T-cells were shown to correlate with the admission of inflammable Il-6-removal monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method for testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaxon (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or a swab sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples at a difference of two weeks and the immediate significance of the result is only reduced.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and release a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can identify active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) are being developed, but have not yet been widely used.
Tested Chinese experience has shown that purity only ranges from 60 to 70%.
The United States FDA approved the first-month care testing on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of this month. Diagnostic directories issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested clinical facilities and methods for detecting infections based on epidemiological risk.
Complications of bilateral multilobar ground-glasses with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infections.
Subpleural dominance, Crazy Peeving (forming the variable alveolar-filled lobular septal fat) and integration can appear as a progression of the disease.
Here are some facts about microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Pleurisy, Pericarditis, Lung Integration and Pulmonary Oedema
There are four types of seriousness of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: intermediate inflammation with the formation of pulmonary oedema, pneumonia hyperplasia, large abnormal pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar excipients.
DAD is caused by severe respiratory difficulty syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
NEMONIA NIKOMAKING: The association of elviolar cavities and excruciating in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Deposition (DIC) in the veins; Leucoerythroblastic reaction
Protective measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the tissue cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing and that no tissue is available.
After a cough or sneeze, proper hand hygiene is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places in areas that limit transmission from asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces, banning travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also require people to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
"No drug has been effective in preventing COVID-19. As the vaccine is not expected to be available as soon as 2021, the main part of the COVID-19 management is trying to reduce the epidemic peak known as ""to straighten the curve""."
The CDC recommends people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after asking your nose, coughing or sneezing.
It recommends using an additional 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis."
Glycerin is added as a moisturizer.
Assistive care has been arranged to include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and other important organs that may be affected.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of having the virus should wear a normal face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
It is recommended to improve personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and dietary immune system.
Helpful treatments may be useful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. investigators and pulmonologists have collected treatment recommendations from various agencies on the free resource IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen in the first experiment.
Especially when performing procedures that can produce aerosols such as intubation or hand ventilation, precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of infection with the virus in health care settings.
Healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions, as well as placing individuals in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). The CDC mentions guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended gear is as follows: PPE gowns, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical equipment. When available, priority is given to the respirator (rather than facemasks).
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air such as dust but do not guarantee efficacy against special biological agents for use other than labels.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face coverings or household masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilators or alternatives, but there are a few percent of the cases.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied in hospitals for people with high flows of nasal canola and with two-level positive airway arcs found some evidence that can prevent intubation.
It is not known which of these two groups has the same benefits.
Some physicians prefer to stay in invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this method limits the transmission of aerosol particles when compared to a high-secret nail cannula. Serious cases are very common in older people (aged over 60 years and especially people over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries don't have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the health system to manage the sudden rise in COVID-19 cases enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of intensive care units were admitted, 2.3% needed ventilation mechanical support, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the ICU.
Acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ARDS) is further complicated by mechanical ventilation as COVID-19 develops and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Enabled ventilators and high PEEP are required for pressure control modes to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available in older ventilators.
Research on potential therapies began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested have already been approved for other users or have already been put to advanced testing.
People with severe illness can be seen using antiviral drugs.
The WHO suggested volunteers to participate in efficacy and safety trials for potential treatments. The FDA has allowed temporary certification on health-benefit plasma as a testing treatment in severe or immediate risks to the individual’s life.
No clinical studies have been conducted to show that this disease is safe and effective.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is capable of detecting the potential risk of infection by using the monitoring data of the contact of the natural.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analysts from cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they have come in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who could be infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to protect and protect those who have come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the location data of the phone with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera told a mobile phone operator that "40% of people, whatever they are, are still going to die."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kirsty Coljuid, also called for a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel stressed from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, and infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic deprivation are a complete storm to harm people's health and fitness."
The disease takes the same form as other common upper respiratory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, taking some or no symptoms for a moderate period of time.
Acute or chronic illness that can take three to six weeks to heal usually heals within two weeks.
Pregnant women may be at high risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is low. In some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs by pneumonia.
Among those most severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into a serious respiratory problem syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
An increase in conjunctivitis, especially prothrombin, has been described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while in 4% of this group has seen exceptional kidney function.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show an increased liver enzyme (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, there is an average of seven days between hospitalization and death of the patients who have been shifted to the ICU.
In the study of early cases, the average time to die from early symptoms within the full range of six to 41 days was 14 days.
According to China's National Health Commission (NHC), the female mortality rate was 1.7% while the male mortality rate was 2.8%.
Histopathological tests of post-mortem lung samples show alveolar damage spread with cellular fibromyalgia excrete in both lungs.
Viral cytoplasmic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart failure was noted by high levels of troponin or heart disease.
According to data from the United States March, 89% of people admitted to hospital are in an existing condition. The availability of medical resources in the region and the socio-economic system can also affect mortality.
Regional variations, as well as legal difficulties, may differ in estimates of death from this condition.
The death rate is likely to be higher than normal for low-calorie cases.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of contracted cases in the past means that the current death rate has been ignored.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have serious problems with COVID-19 than non-smokers and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns about the long-term ordering of the disease have increased.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found that some people who recovered from the disease had reduced their lung capacity by 20% to 30% and that a lung scan caused organ damage.
After this, it can also cause a severe respiratory syndrome.
As of March 2020, previous infections were not known to provide effective and long-term immunity to people who were free from the disease.
Immunity based on the behavior of other coronaviruses is also likely, but positive cases for coronaviruses were reported at a later date.
These cases are worse than re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and spread through infection, which is believed to have originated from animals.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the prevalence of the infection was driven by human-to-human transmissions almost as a whole.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, revealed that the date of the first symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported early onset of symptoms as of December 8, 2019.
Many measures are commonly taken to measure the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time and age of the initial outbreak, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave U07.1 for confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. It specified an emergency ICD-10 disease code for confirmed deaths.
Based on data from the Johns Hopkins University, as of 17 April 2020, the worldwide case-to-death ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Mortality Rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with the disease and the Infection Mortality Rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These figures are not based on time and do not follow a certain population from infection through case resolution.
Even if all infected people do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, in a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) has already died.
At Gallelet, the disease was spread by carnival celebrations, and spread to younger people, who had a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified as such.
Germany's health care system is not perfect.
In the Netherlands, according to blood donors, there may be antibodies with about 3%.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates vary for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have shown a high mortality rate in men.
The highest risk in men is in their 50s, in which the gap between men and women only ends in the 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
It is not known the exact cause of gender differences, but may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender-based immune dysfunction, low prevalence of smoking in women and development of co-morbid conditions of high blood pressure at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked sexual data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral patients such as Ebola, HIV, Influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women and they are highly likely to come into contact with the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on February 11 that the official name of the disease would be ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described CO as coronavirus, VI as virus, D as disease and 19 as initially identified at the time of the outbreak: 31 December 2019.
Its name has been chosen according to the International Recommendation to name a specific geographic area (such as China), without referring to an animal species or group of humans, to prevent misconceptions. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named according to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"The WHO uses ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""CoVID-19-responsible virus"" in public communications as well."
"Both diseases and viruses are commonly known as ""coronavirus""."
During the period of early outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the provisional names for 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illnesses and viruses as per the 2015 guidance against using places in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing health care materials such as nail swabs and parts of ventilators.
In an example, when urgent ventilator valves were needed in an Italian hospital, and the supplier was unable to deliver the required valves in time, the local startup had to print the 100 valves that were needed overnight by reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, missed and misinformation was revealed and quickly spread online.
Humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find the effect of viral replication on pigs, pigs, and chickens.
No medications or vaccines are approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medications has been carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "mutual test" to assess the treatment effects of existing four antiviral compounds in the highest hopes of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available but various bodies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
The functions previously performed in SARS-CoV are being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three types of research strategies.
Initially, researchers are aiming to build a full virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, when it is inactive or dead, is aimed at giving the human body an immediate immune response when it is infected with the new COVID-19.
The second strategy, All Unit Vaccines, aims to create vaccines that sensitize the immune system in some of the virus's sub-units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S-Spike protein that helps the virus to digest the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to create a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technology to vaccinate).
Testing vaccines from any of these strategies were to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers from Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-based improvements were suggested as a potential challenge for a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are taking place.
Seven pre-approved trials for malaria were evaluated, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Due to the report by the end of April, Chinese research with nine phase III trials in Remdesivir in different countries makes re-introduced antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a review of therapeutic developments for COVID-19 vaccine and test candidates has been carried out. Several existing drugs for COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Retonavir and Interferon, combined with Lopinavir/Retinavir.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence for effectiveness by Remdesivir.
Remdesivir was used to treat patients who had been treated with compassion.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine previously used to treat malaria is being studied in February 2020 with preliminary results in China.
They are, however, calling for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a gram daily dose, noted that the double dose could have been dangerous and deadly as high as possible.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use certification of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in people undergoing treatment for COVID-19. The Chinese Seventh Edition Directory also included Interferon, Ribavirin or Umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data showing high amounts of ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended to proceed in vivo studies after it has been shown to inhibit the low incidence of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early spike protein priming by transmembrane protease Sirin 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interactions with ACE2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have many limitations that prevent the medical community from accepting these therapies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
Hydroxychloroquine has proven to have anti-cytokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
Stage 2 non-regulatory tests are being conducted at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Cytokine combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify typhoons, this is to reverse those developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome seen by a different cause.
So far, there is no evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The act of transferring the purified and mixed antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them has been investigated as a non-vaccination method of inactivated vaccines.
This strategy was attempted for SARS with inconclusive consequences.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibody-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum made from liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and containing specific antibodies to the virus can be increased to deploy even faster.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Lee Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central Hospital, who came into contact with COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus and died.
