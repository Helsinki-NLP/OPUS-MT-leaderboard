At the international level, China is trying to make the yuan international currency at the same level as the euro, yen, and pound, including the dollar.
Given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupees and rubles.
India and Russia today agreed on the S-400 missile system, amid US sanctions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will sign the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is in the process of paving the way for the US dollar to pay for the deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making the deal in rupees and rubles in view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US.
U.S. sanctions imposed during China's
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
The ban made it almost impossible for China to buy missiles using the U.S. dollar.
However, in recent years, China has tried to raise its currency yuan as an international currency against the dollar.
After this initiative, China is constantly trying to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, yen, and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserves of the US dollar in international trade.

Earlier, US sanctions on INS Chakra's repair deal, which was leased from Russia, had led to the acquisition of an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia.
Economic analysts claim that in order to come out of such a situation, India should exercise the deal by using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
It is worth noting that so far, all defence deals with Russia have been done through the dollar.
Why did the U.S. Constitution become law?
President Donald Trump in August approved the Katsas law in view of Russia's modern defense missile system. - The United States has drafted the law to prevent Russia from acting against the interests of the United States at the international level.
It is worth noting that the U.S. law is designed in keeping with the activities of Russia.
These include Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and its takeover of Crimea, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Today, the Supreme Court's decision on whether or not namaz is an integral part of Islam in the mosque
The High Court is likely to deliver its verdict on Thursday on the pleas of a Muslim group seeking reconsideration by a larger bench of the Supreme Court's 1994 decision on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land title dispute.
The Supreme Court has ruled that namaz is not an integral part of Islam in the mosque.
A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer will hear the matter.
He was released safely on July 20.
Siddiqui, a fundamentalist in the Ayodhya case, had objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M. Ismail Farooqui.
It has been said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayers offered by followers of Islam.
Siddiqui has died and is represented by his legal heirs.
The Muslim community has argued before a Bench headed by the Hon'ble the Prime Minister that the observation of the High Court in this decision needs to be reconsidered by a five-member Bench.
Because of its Babri Masjid - Ram Mandir, the land dispute will have an impact.
Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Siddiqui's legal representative, said the mosque was not an integral part of Islam.
The High Court made this comment without any scrutiny of any kind or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the apex court that some Muslim communities were trying to delay the long-pending Ayodhya temple-Musjid Bhoomi dispute by seeking reconsideration of the remarks that some Muslim communities were not an integral part of the mosque.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing on behalf of the UP government, said the dispute was waiting for a final decision for almost a century.
Rupee crosses 71-mark against US dollar, highest ever fall
As demand for the dollar rose amid rising crude oil prices, the rupee hit a low of 26 paise in early trade today.
Yesterday, the rupee opened at Rs 70.95 against the US dollar in the international market and then moved to the level of Rs 71.
The rupee closed at 70.74 on Thursday.
According to traders, strong demand for US currency from oil importers at the end of the month, the strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies in the world, in hopes of increasing interest rates along with trade tensions between China and the US, hit the domestic currency.
The rise in crude oil prices has also affected the rupee's rise in inflation and the export of foreign institutional investors to the domestic stock market.
At the beginning of the Asian trade, the standard british crude price reached $78 a barrel.
During his first visit to the country, the Prophet preached the gospel to the people of the world.
The World Cup: The World Cup has been a milestone in the history of Test cricket for hundreds of years.
It is being compared with Sachin Tendulkar, who is the head of the earth shawl.
In the same way that the world has played a big inning at the school level, Sachin has also been in the inning discussion.
Sachin Tendulkar tweeted, "Congratulations to Prithvi Shaw on his century.
During his first visit to the country, the Prophet preached the message of peace.
Sachin Tendulkar was also seen happy from the start of this earth shawl.
He also praised the country.
The secretary recalled the day when he saw the earth shaking for the first time and what he had to say to take it.
"About 10 years ago, my friend Jagdish Chavan once asked me to watch the Prithvi Shaa bat.
"This young player wants to meet you and if you can meet him, it'll be fine," Chavan said.
The doctor took his friend's advice and went to check on him.
"He still remembers that he told his friend that this child will one day play for India," the secretary said, "he told his friend that you are looking at the future Indian cricketer."
The doctor said, "Are you telling the truth?"
To which the Secretary said, "Remember my words, this child will play for India."
He told the audience about the world's most beautiful city.
I've seen the world, and I've seen the world, and I've seen the world, and I've seen the world, and I've seen the world.
It's a different story to have a talent in a player, but what you do with that talent is more important.
If you want to be successful in international cricket, you need to be able to learn quickly.
It is necessary to have adaptability (the ability to play depending on the conditions) to play longer in different fields and conditions.
I think the Earth Shaa has the ability to play the game in different situations and this is the greatest strength on earth.
He said that the earth is the center of the eye and the hand of the shawl.
The way he catches the ball line and the lanth, this is seen in very few players.
This is the natural gift of the earth, which many players don't have.

Is the reader's attention-grabbing?
How can the dialect of Ghazni's Sultan Mahmood Ghazni, who is a somnath temple mastermind and a villain for the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, the research of Professor Shanta Pandey, a historian at Delhi University, has made it clear that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
When Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, it was natural to question that Sanskrit was the only language of the so-called high-class Brahmins.
Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birajdar of Mumbai remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Birajdar, who also speaks simple Sanskrit, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before its release.
The Holy Qur'an is written in Sanskrit.
<0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> <0x2B> .
Not only did he study in Solapur's Pathshala, he is one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country today.
However, it's not easy to see that Panditji doesn't want to give lectures as a Sanskrit Pandit in the US or other countries to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is the Pandit of Sanskrit.
There's a lot of Sanskrit literature out there.
In order to learn Sanskrit from the United States, students have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
A dissertation of a Ph.D. in Sanskrit in most of the universities other than the Banaras Hindu University in India is also written in the language of that State.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati, but remember that education was taught only in the Sanskrit medium in the universities of Takshashila and Nalanda.
The practice of Sanskrit in Afghanistan is not only Sanskrit, but it has also been noted that the dialect of Ghazni's Sultanate is Sanskrit.
The coins are said to have been inscribed on the "Mahmood Suratran" in Sanskrit, and the grammar of the Sanskrit has been traced to Panini, a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru said in a huge chapter in "Darshan of My Hind" that the full language of Afghans and Pathans derives from Sanskrit in "the power and sustainable power of Sanskrit."
At present, it is accepted that not only Indian languages, but Indo-European languages are also derived from Sanskrit.
Another surprise to Dr. Ambedkar’s national language is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the main architect of the Constitution, and some other Muslims as well as members of the Constituent Assembly, had proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language when the debate on the national language was held in the Constituent Assembly on September 13, 1949.
The discussion of that day and the earlier report published in the National Herald on September 11, 1949, estimates the insurgency of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to determine a national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as the official language, but the national language is not the same.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Prime Minister Nehru also spoke with great respect about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he has turned on Sanskrit, and scholars of the world have detailed the importance of Sanskrit: "In the year 1874, Sir William Jones said, "God knows how old the Sanskrit language is, but its composition is wonderful."
It's fuller than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more decent than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since it has been considered as a folk language."
At present, Sanskrit is the only language to take oath by members like Union Minister Smriti Irani as a member of Parliament.
We need to preserve the year of Sanskrit and make it alive and popular.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It's only a matter of trying hard to make a difference, rather than trying to make a difference.
