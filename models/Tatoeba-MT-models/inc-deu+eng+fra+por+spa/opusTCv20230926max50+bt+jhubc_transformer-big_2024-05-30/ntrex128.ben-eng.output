Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about their own 'mappets'
Several members of the House of Representatives have expressed concern over the change in their designation to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this fear is the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to Wesh Parliament.
Members of various political parties are afraid to face ridicule over the change in the name.
A member of the Labour Party's Assembly said his party was concerned that "the new designation coincided with the rhythm of Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Welsh: In Welsh, Twp means fool and Pwp means mall.
A member of the Pleasure Assembly said they were "not pleased" as a team and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was looking at the name change as "open minded" but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between the MWP and the MWP.
In this sense, the pronunciation of the Wesh letter W is similar to the pronunciation of the U of the English word Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently formulating provisions for initiating the name change process, said: “The members must make their own final decision as to what will be the details of the terms of office of the members of the Assembly.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change their names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public vote in which the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament received overwhelming support.
With regard to the designation of Assembly members, the Commission is supporting the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP has received the most support in the population.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting a different option, but it will be difficult for the presiding officer, Elaine Jones, to reach a consensus, which is expected to submit a draft of the legislation within a few weeks.
The amendments will include changes to the working of the Assembly, including the disqualification of the members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
After debating this provision, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to cast their final vote on what should be their designation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was to avoid a decade-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a symbol of the establishment of a claim over its territory, and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Georg Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, said he would reject the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, think that the name change is only a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's church is silent as the churches of Harlem remain silent
"The older people I've spoken with say that historically there was a church and bars in each corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's nothing today."
He said that it is understandable that the bars are disappearing.
Today, social media is used in different ways.
"Panichalls are no longer the living room of the area where everyone goes on a regular basis."
In the case of the church, he is concerned that the money that is being sold to the property, the leaders will not last as long as they think, “And today and tomorrow, they will go back to where they started.”
Apartment buildings and condominiums can be built in places of the church where there will be people living who will not help the rest of the temples in the area, he added.
“Most of those who buy condoms in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so they will speed up the day these churches are closed because most of the people who live in these condoms are less likely to become members of the church.”
Both churches were founded by the white congregation before Harlem became a black-dominated metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later St. Martins.
The original Whitening Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
A black church nearby took possession of the building.
A black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martins, who led a boycott against retailers at A Hundred and Twenty-Fifth Street for refusing to hire and promote black workers – which is a major road to shopping in Harlem.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but when the parishes of Father Johnson planned to restore it, they arranged for the construction of the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, proudly named Carillon the "Bell of the Poor."
The expert Carillon, who played in July last year, called it something different: “a historical asset” and “incomparable historical musical instrument.”
Tiffany Nyong, an expert at the University of Michigan, also said that it was the world's first carillon served by a black drummer, which was played by Dionio A. Lind, who was assigned 18 years ago to play the larger carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Meredith said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complex event for architects and contractors, appointed by church leaders or episcopal dioceses.
Vestry – the parish’s governing body, which consists of general leaders – told their concerns in July that they thought the Diocese would “transfer costs” to the Vestry, although Vestry was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent to the Diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency in the work of dialysis.
Thirteen-year-old California man injured in shark attack after drowning to catch gorilla shrimp
A 13-year-old boy was injured in a shark attack after he dived to catch gorilla shrimp on the first day of the gorilla shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on Beacon Beach, near Nancy.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he heard the boy's screams for help while he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, paddling there and helping a group of people get him out of the water.
Hamel said he initially thought the boy was roaring at the pleasure of catching a mole shrimp, but then "then realizes that the boy was screaming 'beating me!'"
“They bite me!”
Her voice was broken," said Hamel, as he approached the boy.
"I scream for everyone to get up from the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in a critical condition.
The attacking shark species are not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Jills said in a news briefing that a shark appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but it was identified as not a dangerous species.
The victim also suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad, to Nsinitus's Swamy, for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Jails said more than 135 species of sharks are found in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
San Francisco plans to enter the U.S. market
Sensberrys is set to compete with Boots, SuperDrugs and Debenhams in the business of retail stores, including the Isle of Wight, and specialist support staff, such as department stores.
As part of a strong effort to enter the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion fashion market, these large fashion Isles will be launched in 11 stores across the country and will be launched in other stores if proven to be successful.
This investment is coming to the fore as supermarkets are looking for new ways to simultaneously fill shelves filled with TVs, microwaves and home decor.
Sensberrys said it would double the size of its packaging to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Twizzerman, and Dr. Poe, for the first time.
Cosmetic ranges such as L'Oreal, Mebelin and Barts Bizz will have more space, including separate spaces for brands like Boots.
The supermarket is launching its boutique makeup range so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – which has become very popular among young buyers.
In addition, the perfume vendor The Fragrance Shop will run product delivery tests at two Sensbury shops, the first of which was launched last week in Craidon, South London, and the second will be launched later this year at Sally Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping online and buying small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to make extra efforts to accommodate buyers.
Mike Cooper, the chief executive of Sensburys, said the outlets would look like department stores as the supermarket chain is competing with discount stores like Aldi and Leedl and will have more services and food-no-products.
The company has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores since the purchase of the two chains Argos and Habitatts two years ago, and has also opened a number of habeaters, which have increased the sales of groceries and made the acquisition more profitable, the company claims.
The previous attempts to overhaul the supermarket's apparel and pharmacy department have failed.
Sensbaris tested a joint project with the first Fike Boots in the 2000s but the project was closed due to conflict over how the profits from the chemist's shop at supermarkets would be shared.
Sensberrys is adopting this new strategy after selling the pharmacy business of its 281 stores to Lloyd's Pharmacy owner Seleccio.
The company said that by adding a luxurious range of skincare brands, Lloyds will play a role in the plan, including La Roche Pose and Vishy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sensbury's commercial director, said: "We changed the rice-slopes of our islands to improve the environment for our buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be present to give advice.
Our brand range has been designed to meet all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a reliable fashionable destination that will challenge the old methods of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'Agnisurma' to withdraw from Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancels a deal with the life-style brand of Dragons Den star Peter Jones to focus on his new contract with Marx & Spencer and ITV
Willow has no time for their homewares and accessories brand Trulli.
The business of the pair is compared to the Gup brand of Gineth Paltrow.
The morning presenter, 37, reported his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dan’s star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their attractive lifestyle brand business at the last minute – which aims to focus on her new bumper contract with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
Jones became a "firearm" when, in a meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, TV's golden girl admitted that she had no time for her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5million - due to their home goods and accessories brand trolley.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Gup brand and was expected to double Willow's wealth to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced his departure from Trulli on Instagram, Jones left Britain on a jet plane for his holiday accommodation.
A source said: "Truely was at the top of Holly's predominant list so far.
It was part of his long-term future plan that would meet his economic needs for the next few decades.
His decision to retire was a surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, the project was supposed to start soon.
There is a warehouse filling product at Marlowe’s headquarters which is ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the company's exit, which is currently one of Britain's most reliable stars, could cost the company millions of pounds because they have already invested heavily in products such as cushions, candles, clothing and household items, and a possible delay in its launch would add to the loss.
This could lead to the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cape, for over a decade.
Willoughby started Truely with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as president in March.
The couple spends the holidays together and owns 40% of Jones's stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McCartlin as the presenter of ITV's I Am Celebrity Show.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked that after expressing a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and making a comment that some would consider "non-presidential."
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his memoir "Presentation of the News."
"I didn't give up."
He said that Kim is looking forward to meeting for the second time since their initial meeting in Singapore in June. Trump called their first meeting a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the nuclear disarmament debate has stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the United States sees no "relative response" to North Korea's previous disarmament move.
However, he said the United States has imposed sanctions.
During his speech at the rally, Trump expressed a more positive outlook.
"We are in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
It could have killed tens of millions of people.
We have a good relationship now."
He claims that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – which have ended rocket tests, helped free the prisoners and bring the rest of the American staff back home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president-sponsored, but in this crowded arena, there would have been only 200 people standing here instead of 10,000 trying to get in," Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia kill hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign private companies were told they did not need help.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international cooperation, so the matter is challenging," Mr. Sambang said.
While a team is gathering to go to Save the Children's Palau, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palau to determine whether foreign companies would be allowed to participate in relief operations.
Despite the regular earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly unprepared to deal with this nature's fury.
Although Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, other seaside shelters are being visited at fairs.
Despite the continued state of alert, the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palau, possibly affecting life losses.
Traveling to many islands in Indonesia is challenging even when the time is good.
Natural disasters make the communication system more resilient.
A ship deployed to Lombok is on its way to the hospital to rescue the victims, but it will take at least three days for the ship to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo laid the development of Indonesia's impoverished infrastructure at the center of his election campaign, and he invested huge sums of money in the construction of roads and railways.
But the lack of investment before next year's re-election has crippled Mr Joko's government.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from prolonged communal tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
Riots between Christians and Muslims killed more than 1,000 people and left more than 10,000 homeless. The riots led to clashes between the two groups on the streets with riots, arrows and other rough weapons.

Zardan Shakir's pass was received at a distance of 30 metres from Starz Chelsea's goalpost when his team was trailing 1-0.
He first took the ball to the left and then took a shot towards the far post.
The shot goes to the right corner of the net at the top of the box.
At the end of the day, the ball jumped over Kepa Ariyabalaga and fell into the net.
"It's important to get in the right position to catch the ball in time, because players like Shake always push the ball as much as possible, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible," Starz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I give Kante a quick tone as he sees him coming forward and doesn't have a shot at goal without thinking too much."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the half-time after Aden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute of the game.
The Blues striker Matteo Kovacic passed, then turned around from the midfield and ran into Liverpool's hawk.
Kovacic went through a ball to the midfield.
He then gave Hazard a beautiful ball in the box in Liverpool's defence.
Hazard defeated the defenders in the race and scored a goal on the left foot in a remote post net.
Napoli will face Liverpool in the group stage of the Champions League in San Paulo, Italy at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
Indonesia's death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the debris of the 7.5-magnitude quake that hit the building on Friday and caused a 20-foot high tide, Sutopo Puro Nuagraho, a spokeswoman for the organization, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of 380,000, is filled with the debris of the destroyed building.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with a woman's death
An investigation into the murder was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in the Berkenhead mercide.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at Grayson Muse on John Street at 7:55 a.m., a 32-year-old man suspected of murder has been arrested.

'History rewrite' of Cromwell's statue in Parliament
The statue will be removed by poetic justice after the talibanic destruction of many of England's cultural and religious monuments in the hands of its fanatic hardliners.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's advice as "disobedience" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "In the current dispute over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, located outside the Westminster Palace, would become the target.
The destruction of the iconoclasm or patterns during the English Civil War was not carried out by or under the command of Cromwell.
In the previous century, the statue of the wrong Cromwell would be discarded in the work of his predecessor Thomas.
The iconic statue of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorncroft, is a symbol of the opinion of the 19th century and part of a historical character that many consider worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people think of Cromwell as the protector of Parliament in the face of external pressures, in his case, against the pressures of the monarchy – which are now less than the opinion of the people, but in the 19th century were of the opinion of many.
But this is part of the ongoing historical debate as to whether it is a fully accurate picture of the time.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century have shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a familiar character who has represented a party to this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
A Chinese farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, who has only been identified by his genealogy as "Yuan," is found in a pork stable in Liupanshui Bazaar, Guizhou province in southern China, with arterial torso and blood clots, a South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm.
According to the report, he along with his brother Phupato came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs from nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and found that the door of a pig stand next to him was open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the stable with blood on his face.
A forensic test confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My uncle's legs were bleeding and wounds," said Fupato Bhai, who was identified as his genealogy "U," Guiyang Evening News reports.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that kills the man is not the man or his brother.
A market manager told Evining News that police were collecting ammunition at the scene and the pig was kept in separate custody so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating to determine the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been incidents of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds kept a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife came and frightened the pig.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his pig in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but can act as a "trigger or stimulant" to get a taste of blood.
"They're just doing evil.
They bite small, very interested animals... but don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to deal with them enough," he said.
Hurricane Rosar's remains will cause heavy rains across southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening the strength of the cyclone as it flows over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, heavy rains are expected to cause flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern parts of the United States.
Today at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugene, Mexico.
Rosa is due to go north on Sunday.
On this side, a system has begun to take shape in the Pacific Ocean and is heading east toward the US West Coast. Rosa Baha will hit the California peninsula on Monday as a seasonal storm and it will push deep tropical moisture northwards to the southwestern United States.
There will be up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday due to Rosa.
It is also likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and cause heavy to very heavy rainfall in the coming days over southeastern parts of the state.
Locally ranging from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding or sudden flooding, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Due to the deep tropical humidity, rainfall rates in different places can range from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be between 2 and 4 inches in different parts of the southwest, especially in most areas of Arizona.
Flash flooding and rapid deterioration of the situation are possible due to the scattered speed of tropical rains.
It would be foolish to walk in the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyon fires to turn into dreadful rivers and there will be strong winds, including dust, due to thunderstorms.
Heavy rainfall will occur locally in parts of the coastal region of southern California due to the raging system.
The amount of rainfall can be up to half an inch, which can lead to small debris flows on glazed roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
There may be some scattered tropical rains in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, after which the rains will increase and spread throughout the area from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rains will reach the four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
There may be some extreme temperature changes in different parts of the United States in October as the Arctic cools, but tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a good example of a dramatic change in temperature in the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the remaining summer temperatures will try to rise and spread again.
Most parts of the U.S. central and eastern regions are expected to warm by early October, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to the northeast to about 80 degrees.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate that temperatures in the eastern part of the United States are likely to be higher than average in the first half of October.
Bret Cavaner's hearing has been watched by more than 20 million people.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and her alleged sexual assault allegations against Christine Blaze Ford, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, have garnered tense testimony from more than 20 million viewers across six television networks on Thursday.
On this side, political disputes continue, with broadcasters suspending regular events due to Friday's last-minute surprise: a deal signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that would allow the FBI one week to investigate complaints.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 per cent sure that Cavana had been drinking at a high school party and was trying to undress her.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that the incident did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as mentioned in Nielsen's report, watched the event on Friday.
The company was aggregating average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the program, were not immediately available with the number of viewers, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Networks.
And Nielsen usually faces problems with the quality of the viewers sitting in the office.
The number of spectators to the event was equal to the number of football playoffs or Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinion show hosts strongly supported Cavana's nomination, attracted the highest number of viewers on all networks broadcasting the day-long hearing, with an average of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
There was still interest after the hearing.
Fleck was the central character in today's play.
After the moderate Republican's office said he would vote for Cavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as he climbed up to reach the hearing room of the Judiciary Committee and the protesters shouted for him.
He stood in front of the protesters for a few minutes, which was broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think Cavana is telling the truth to the country?"
She is told, "You have power, when many women are helpless."
Fleck said his office made a statement before the elevator closed and said he had more to say in the committee's hearing.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Cavana's nomination to a full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcast networks broadcast live.
But Fleck said he would vote on the condition that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which were requested by the minority Democrats.
His conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon, has been partly influenced by Fleck's acceptance.
After speaking with Kun, Fleck spoke to a few other senators and reached his conclusion.
Flake's decision was breathtaking, as it was clear that Republicans did not have a vote to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation based on allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing a “political game” about Britain’s future and ignoring the nation’s interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham.
In another interview published next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continues to criticize May's so-called checkers plan for Brexit, saying the UK and the EU offer to collect each other's revenues is "completely unreasonable."
Wed Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and reported that Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, CBS' associate WAFB said in a report.
After Simpson was arrested, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to The Advocate, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the autopsy investigator in the Eastern Baton Rouge area released a preliminary report on Friday, citing injuries to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police with assisting in the investigation of the fugitive accused, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area, which resulted in the arrest of the accused.
The Athletic Director of LSU, Joe Aleva, thanked the law enforcement agency in the area for its "clear efforts and the pursuit of justice."
Simmons was 20 years old.
The 6-foot 6-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "saddened" and "hurried" by Wade's death.
"It's always a matter of concern," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
A volcanic eruption from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Response Center (NDRC) on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the increase in volcanic facial activity and the scale of gas and steam production reached 183 in 24 hours.
The center was observing a number of roaring and roaring.
Photos posted on social media showed a thinning of the windshield of the car in areas such as Mexico City's Jochimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in volcanic activity since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that shook Mexico in September 2017, which is just 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Goo, has been active since 1994.
Catalan separatists clash with police ahead of Independence Day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in riot police clashes with pro-independence protesters as they joined anti-government protesters to celebrate the first year of Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and colored powders at them in the face of police obstacles, causing black clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists gatherings.
Later in the day, the police used sticks to stop the attack.
For hours, the freedom fighters chanted "I will not forget, I will not forgive" and the protesters faced the supporters of unity who were chanting "Long live Spain."
14 people received treatment for minor injuries caused by the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been brewing in the region since Madrid declared the October 1 referendum, which celebrates separatist Catalans, illegal.
The majority of voters voted in favor of independence, although the voter turnout was low because the majority of the public boycotted the vote against segregation.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed in clashes with police last year as a result of blockades during polling across the region.
The freedom fighters were on the streets all night on Friday to block demonstrations in favour of the national police.
The protestors continued their activities but were forced to go on different roads.
Narcissist Termis, 68, an electrician with his wife, who participated in the separatist protests, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
"I'm glad my parents were able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a significant but narrow victory in provincial elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their run where many of their well-known leaders are awaiting trial by voluntarily deportation or detention for their organization's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the protest in support of police on his phone, said the dispute was created by politicians from both sides.
He said, “The day is coming to an end.
Oryol Junckers, one of the Catalan leaders who is in pre-trial detention on Saturday, announced late last year that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to prevent the suppression and oppression of democratic values from the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate for the European elections," he said.
London: Man arrested after a car collided with his home.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car at a home in London.
The incident took place at Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 Bangladesh time.
Deputy Inspector Bob Bloomings said the gates and buildings were damaged.
At some point, the car may have crashed and crashed.
Manger scored a 1-0 win over the Rangers in Livingston.
Dolly Manger scored the first goal for Livingston.
Stunned by the promoted Livingston Rangers, Steven Gerrard gave his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Manger made the Gaul gap as Gary Holt's team equalled the Hibernians with a second goal.
As a result, Gerard's team went on to win the Premiership this season with no out-of-the-way wins and will face the top-ranked Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
Earlier on Thursday, Rangers Rapid will host Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston has already increased their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt, who came to replace Kenny Miller last month, still not able to taste the defeat.
Stevenson has lost a lot of respect for his opponents.
They should have been ahead long before Holt's team scored goals, as their aggressive attitude created all sorts of problems for the Rangers!
When Scott Robinson breaks the defense but fails to yield to his own efforts, Alan Lithgow can only drive his effort across the wideway after sliding to match Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that the guests could have trouble in the set-piece.
That was the main goal of the strategy.
Rangers concedes a free-kick and opens the Livingston goal account. Declan Gallagher and Robinson Manga come together to set up, who scored a goal from the center of the one-touch box.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession but they were treating the hosts' defense as impeccable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of the time ejecting.
This trend continued even in the second half, though Alfredo Morlos put off a shot of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and won another set-piece for Livingston from Lithgow Wide.
The crosses were constantly coming into the Livingston box and also becoming increasingly clear, although two penalty claims - alternative Glenn Middleton - were dismissed after Hale's challenge and for the handball.
“ Incredible Celebrity Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alessandra Lamont Tony McCarney Arena
Excellent performances and results for Livingston.
To some people, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations at their upward speed.
Their style of play and players have rarely changed since returning to the top level, but credit has to go to Holt for the way he unites the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, created a greatly organized defense, and always kept the menga Conor Goldson and Joe Walsh on the edge.
The Rangers, however, were less impressed.
Under Gerard's rule, they have lost their value.
They lacked the final ball - only once they opened up the hosts - and that's a warning for the Rangers, who are now on the middle table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne.
The situation was very grim as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday for a Brexit.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They debated human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police made a protective cover to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of whom were Kurds - were heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him into the country.
This conflict demonstration proves that a visitor is praised by the German Turks as heroes and condemned by others as dictators.
Motorcyclist killed in road accident in Depttford
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at about 10:15 a.m. on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, near the connection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street.
The driver stopped the car and the cyclist was given first aid, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened again just months after another bicycle accident on Children's Street, which was located 1 mile from Saturday's crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin.
The road has been closed and bus restrictions have been put in place, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the chaos.
Six prison officers were injured in the high-security male prison chaos, the prison office responded.
At 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, chaos broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Orchestershire.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the chaos, including eight inmates who are in a branch.
Officers at the scene were treated for injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be brought under the law and they will spend much longer behind the prison.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was learnt that the prison administrator had gone to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot officers were called to prison to deal with a serious chaos where the workers were attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (Although drought prone areas may benefit)
Tremors in the tropical low-pressure Arizona are rare, but that seems to be exactly what will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa sweeps across the Southwest Desert with its remaining strength at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Department has already issued flash flood watches in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City cities, including southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to reach directly over the Phoenix on Tuesday and with rain by the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Department of Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure condition within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the A-Z border.”
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with the Mogul Rim in Arizona, which can be up to 6 inches in isolated quantities.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive roughly 1 to 2 inches of rain, which can be up to 4 inches in isolated quantities.
Rainfall may be a blessing for people who are out of danger of flooding as areas are dry
Although the floods are a very serious concern, this rainfall will probably be somewhat beneficial as the south-west is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought observations, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second-highest category, Weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will cause landslides across Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which is still a strong hurricane, is moving at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and 12 miles north of every hour.
The storm is intensifying as it is facing cold water in the Pacific Ocean.
So, a landslide is expected in Mexico by the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains may occur across parts of Mexico, which pose a significant flood risk.
"There is a possibility of up to 10 inches of rain in northwestern Sonora from Baja California."
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical low-pressure before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, and it will enter southern Utah via Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall can lead to fatal flooding and destructive streams flowing into the desert and landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four men arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in Somerset after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed to death.
The minor boy was found injured in the teres area of Exxilciare in Midsamer Norton around 4 a.m. Bangladesh time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is now in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials have urged those who have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump has said the Cavanaugh Democratic Party's "cruelty, anger."
"A vote on behalf of Judge Cavanagh is a vote to reject the brutal and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh had been vocal about the "cruelty, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she had been sexually abused by him decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified in the hearing of his complaint.
The President said Saturday that "the American people saw the extraordinaryness and qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day."
To the supporters of West Virginia, he said that a vote on Jaz Kavanaugh's behalf would be a vote to protect a lawmaker with a sterling record of public service, the most successful legal entitlement of our time."
While talking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president vaguely acknowledged Cavanaugh's nomination.
"It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not going to participate, but I'm going to participate," he said.
"That's why I've always strived to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "repel and block."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Cavana's nomination is not expected to take place on Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
The earthquake in Indonesia has killed more than 100 people and tolls are rising.
At least 384 people have been killed and many others have been swept away in the aftermath of a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when a six-metre (18-foot) high wave broke off on the coast in the evening, which drove many people to their deaths and destroyed everything on the way.”
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Even during the threat of a tsunami yesterday, people were continuing their activities on the beaches and those who were not able to run immediately and became victims of it," BNP spokesman Sutopo Puro said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come from itself, it pulled all the cars, logs, houses, it hit everything above ground," Nugroho added, adding that the tsunami traveled at speeds of 800 kilometers (497 miles) an hour in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some of the trees have survived the tsunami, and some have survived.
Around 16,700 people have been shifted to 24 centres in Palu.
Images from the sky released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque submerged in water.
The firefighters also arrived in the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the power released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow gulf, can further increase the size of the tsunami
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the infected bodies were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, the casualties and damage could be even greater in the area of Dongala, near the epicenter of the earthquake, around 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu.
"The communication system was "completely crippled without any information," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not giving information that the tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time of the warning.
Photos shared on social media showed a man standing on the top floor of the building yelling at people on the downstairs, warning of a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the bank and flooded the building and the car.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused power outages that cut off communication around Palu and made the rescue efforts of the authorities difficult.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, adding that rescuers now need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed to the general public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palau shelters on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
According to Mr. Dossier, when the World Organization employees were safely moving from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the employees were taking shelter in their office premises, they saw images of the devastation on the way.
"They've seen a lot of houses destroyed there," Doseba added.
That's sad.
Even when the aid teams were on their way to start disaster relief operations, some were still complaining that foreign aid workers were being hampered by a lot of skill.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, food supplies and workers will only be able to come when the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
But it has not been announced yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If once the government says yes, it's a national disaster, then we can start international aid, but we haven't yet made any announcement."
On the second night of the tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing are hoping for miracles that will bring the hope of finding them at the end of a brutal chapter of a natural disaster.
A little boy was picked up from the river on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped in a rock for two days next to her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Jendan Subandono, who trained two paragliders at the Asian Games, is now missing, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that those who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
She added, "I have a responsibility to my own emotions as a pioneer in the field of paragliding."
Mr. Gendron recalled how the news of the Rua Roa Hotel collapse spread to the Paragliding community a few hours later, he was baffled and spread it to the Palu contestants through a WhatsApp message, who attended a festival on the beach.
But instead of being read, his message was read.
He said, "That means the message has not been sent."
Thieves stole $26,750 when they refilled the ATM at Liv's Newport.
The Newport Police Department said in a press release that thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning while employees of the Brinks were keeping money at ATMs.
The driver was emptying ATM money in the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more, Detective Dennis McCarthy said at a news conference.
While he was working, "a Brinks man ran from behind" and ran away with a bag full of money that was ready to be handed over.
According to the press release, many of the witnesses saw the suspects running away, but police have not yet determined the number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone can identify them, they are being asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-368.
Ken West: The rapper has changed his name to YES.
Rapper Kane West has changed his name to Yen.
In announcing the change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: "Officially known as Ken West."
West, 41, was also known as Ye for quite some time and used the name as his surname.
The subject of the name change was revealed before his appearance on T Saturday Night Live, where he hoped to unveil his new album Yandy.
The show's producer said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande at the event, who canceled the event for "emotional reasons."
West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him, as well as the abbreviation for his current professional name.
While discussing the title of the album with Radio Broadcaster Big Boy earlier this year, West said, "I believe that 'y' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'.
It's you, it's us, it's us.
It is said from Cain that, which means the only person, Y, reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more of our identity.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs is known in many ways as Puff Daddy, PDD or DDD, but this year he announced that he preferred the name Profits and Brothers Profits.
A former West colleague, J-G, and Haifen, worked with and without Haifen, the capital.
Mexico's AML also vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López has vowed not to use military force against students forcibly.
López Obrador vowed at the Tolateloco Plaza on Saturday that “do not apply military force to the oppression of the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the leftist student movement in Latin America was building its own stronghold.
López Obrador has apologized to young Mexicans for their monthly education allowances and for helping to build more public universities.
He said the lack of education and employment opportunities are leading to the death penalty.
The U.S. should double the amount of artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the cost of research in this area, says Kai-Fu Li, an artificial intelligence researcher and investor who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This quote comes from various parts of the government, declaring that the United States has a formal strategic deficit in artificial intelligence.
China has already launched its new plan last year: it aims to rank 1st in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The double budget in artificial intelligence research will be a good new beginning where most countries are far behind in this area and we are looking for the next step to advance in artificial intelligence," Lee added.
Double funding could double the chances of achieving the next big artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, invests in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, one of China's leading artificial intelligence firms, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked at Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the American player with the highest rank, and was the executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government's technology competition, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, to diagnose the next step.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee says.
"China is not removing academic leaders; corporates are giving," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited illuminators from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help further the U.S. AI efforts.
“I think the green card should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence,” he said. The AI effort of SI further intensifies.
In July 2017, China's State Council issued its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that spend money on U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of an election committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
According to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law trying to form the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece that blocked efforts by the European Union and NATO to gain membership.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and vetoes the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists believe the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Georg Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and doubted whether the turnout in the boycott campaign would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be legalized.
The question in the referendum ballot was: “You are for membership of NATO and the European Union, including the recognition of a treaty with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay a price to join the European Union and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia so that they can live freely in the shadows of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska Skopje, 79.
Although not legally binding, adequate members of parliament have said they will abide by the results of the vote through decision-making.
A two-thirds majority is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1pm.
However, compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, only 16 per cent voted, while 66 per cent of registered voters voted for them.
"I'm here to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe," said Jose Tenovsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko voted to change the name of the country to a referendum in Macedonia, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join the bloc in the Macedonian Strait on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of service," Kavadarov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be a part of Euro-Asia solidarity.”
Prime Minister Zayev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," Zayev said after the vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future."
A survey released by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday said 30 to 43 percent of voters would vote below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
More than 50 percent of the vote is needed to succeed.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Enter the entire Brighton defense for Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goal
England beat Brighton Defenders Sergio Agüero and Rahim Sterling in a 2-0 victory at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero made it extra easy to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before going to the open field.
There were four green jerseys around the fire.
He turned around a defender before surpassing several others on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to shoot on the right side of the net, defeating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguirre is struggling with some problems on his feet," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But Stirling gave Sky Blues the primary advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into the Brighton region in that game.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen through a beautiful path on the left side edge.
Sean took a few touchdowns before taking Sterling to a distant post.
The ball was tapped into the net just before the sky blues forward crossed the boundary.
City will face Huffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at the Rain-Necker-Arena in Germany.

There was not much reason to force the Nationals to make another start after they were removed from the playoff debate.
However, he hopes to take the mound against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the play-offs have an impact for the one-game lead against NL West's Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies got at least a wild card spot after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get their First Division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, at least we can put our feet on the rubber knowing the atmosphere with Denver's spectators and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I'm facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals haven't yet announced a starter for Sunday, but there are reports that Shermer may be able to pitch in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start his 34th season, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and pitched at his usual restaurant on Sunday.

Trump's rally in West Virginia
While talking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president sharply referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court-elect Brett Cavanaugh.
"Everything we did in November is at risk.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"It's a big, big -- I'm not running but that's why I'm really running all over the place to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrific, horrific radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back their energy by any means necessary, you see this lowliness, the uglyness.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're crushing to get power and control, they just want power and control, we won't give it to them."
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "repel and block."
"And you've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "infuriated and downcast and vile and unreliable."
He called the Senate Judiciary Committee Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received high-pitched criticism from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you find the record?
Oh, ah, what.
No, uh, no, I wait - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer an independent organisation.
People are not allowed to say what they think.
It's no surprise that the people in my neighborhood voted against me.
I was the last Labour MP on the list to let you know that the nature of the bowler will not be welcomed here.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she firmly stood against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security, and on similar issues, on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday stated that “we want to make the meetings inclusive and productive.”
For the first time in my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC meeting took place on Friday night.
But sadly, today, it is not the tone of that meeting, and the promise of "kind, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, with colleagues who I thought I had the same political outlook that I had when I started hoping for a U-turn on me and asking me to take a position that I would not have agreed on under any circumstances - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and though it doesn’t matter what I say – there are calls for me to be removed by abusing social media, condemning the politics at the Centre, and I’m told I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I'm surprised at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a storm of discrimination or racial abuse on a daily basis, but never feel ashamed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of the abuse has become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free organization, and every "unbelief" votes or changes to the rules of the election narrows the party.
For the past two years, many people have advised me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal, and that I would be "okay."
I'm not here to do politics.
When I joined Labour as a schoolgirl 32 years ago, we were provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally destroyed our broader school classrooms, I tried to provide the necessary government services that were most needed – whether as local councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is in any way confused about my policy position and the areas of dissent with the current leadership.
To those who campaigned for the movement on Friday, I can only say that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy showing loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But I really don’t have a message for Nottingham Momentum, whether it’s for my election campaigns, for Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that no disruptive threat or political activity will stop me from doing what I believe is the best interest for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Ir 38-17 Melrose: The Rise of the Unexpected Income
Two attempts to delay the final result may reduce the gap a bit, but there is no doubt that Amir deserved to win in the premiership match of this day's extraordinary recreational tenancy.
They are now the only unbeaten team in the top 10 of the table.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good was their ability to take chances, which helped the hosts win and was the reason why coach Peter Morchi was happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy.”
Melrose’s Robin Christie says: “Ir must give credit, they’ve exploited their prospects better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, led Ir to a yellow card from Scottish player Rory Hughes, who expelled him for the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a majority, and Jason Bagot an unsuccessful attempt.
Clemo increased the lead in the penalty, just before, during the halftime, he scored in a single attempt to make the break 17-5.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap to five points.
The game was then halted for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had become stretched and after the re-starting of the game, earned a lot more with the effort of Stefford McDowell, which was converted into Clemo.
Ayer's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again, after a spell of severe pressure, Melrose's Bruce Colvin tried to punish Ayer's extra player.
Although the hosts are right back, and when Struan Hutchinson sees a yellow card to deal with Clemson without a ball, McFarson gets a touchdown from the penalty line.
Again converts to Clemo, when Kyle Row kicked David Armstrong's box, and Flanker sent Gregor Henry out on the fifth attempt on the home side.
Steel Game Star Restaurants Ready for a New Career in the Industry
Steel game star Ford Kiernan has said he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being nominated as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he himself wrote and co-starred with longtime comic partner Greg Hemfield.
Both have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's final series and it looks like Kieranan is planning his life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the director of AdrifMorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though Scottish Sun sources indicated that Kieranan wanted to engage in Glasgow's "rich restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's landlocked court hopes to reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling a rigging clad Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean-blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases are decorated with this motto: "The sea is our right"
"It's a responsibility to restore it."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, a bloody 19th-century treasure struggle has been lost to Chile, but the memories of the coast are still clear – just like the desire to travel once more to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's verdict on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that momentum, unity, and simplicity, and of course we look forward to results with a positive outlook," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will go in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of decent negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate on giving Bolivia a sovereign outlet at sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Carismatic Indigenous President - who will face a controversial fight for re-election next year - also relies on Monday's ruling.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision for Bolivia - and if so, that will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency did not have the power to grant land to Chile and said it would not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard, indicating that the case was "not complicated," said Chillian International Law expert Paz Gerate.
And it may have gone backwards in the last four years, rather than taking the cause of Bolivia further.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the access to the sea," said Jeret.
Morales's anti-war speech sparked any surplus in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk until a certain point, but it will be very difficult to discuss it later.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The representative of The Hague Bolivia, former president Eduardo Rodriguez Valdez, has denied that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an opportunity to “a great opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile” and “to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit.” He said
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the Maritime issue as a political pole.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"The night is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past"
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not come until it trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will not first disarm nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made by rival leaders during a summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after more than three months in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and would jeopardize North Korea's objection to the U.S. declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington cautioned that Pyongyang could agree to the declaration without first undergoing a significant disarmament process.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about leaving an arsenal, which the country is probably seeing as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal the Latest Line of Huge Headwear on a High Street Near You
If you want to increase your cap collection or block the sun completely, there's no need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of oversized head gears for their SS19 collection on the runway that shocked the Paris Fashion Week style set.
This summer, the highly irrational hat has been covered on Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to Katwa.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top beige hat decorated with wide stems like feathers that covered the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories include decorative watermelon, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also released a selection of weird masks - and at exactly the right time for Halloween.
The lips of many colored masks were similar to that of a honeyball sticker compared to sewing and terrifying fun.
One of the creations is similar to the full scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other one looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the big fashion statement - you're lucky.
Style observers have predicted that huge bonnets can go to the high street near you.
The outsized hats are competing with the 'La Bombe', a two-foot wide streaked straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski is seen wearing.
The cult label behind the highly irrational hat spread across social media has sent another large creation to Katwa - a straw beach bag that is almost as big as a swimsuit model.
The orange rafia bag, which was burned in the La Rivera SS19 collection of Paris Fashion Week Jackie Jackie, was trimmed with rafia fringing and with a white leather handle at the top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMALE: "I hope that next summer the big hats and beach bags will arrive on the High Street - as designers have such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edwards: Language Skills Necessary for World Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, and it continues to have another outstanding test result in 2018, which is only reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, industry, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Individual schools aim to prepare their students for more and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we see that modern language continues to be popular and preferred in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head."
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent test, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rate among individual schools.
68% of foreign language students have achieved higher grades.
The data collected from the 74-member school of SCIS showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent were studying German, 69 per cent were studying French and 63 per cent were studying Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now being held in the same way as subject choice, independent school curriculum and elsewhere in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers attributed their lack of language skills to the reason employers gave them to struggle to fill the vacancy.
So more and more, language skills are becoming essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are needed in a globalized world for more potential job opportunities that require language.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn a second language, will have their real advantage with their lifelong skills acquired in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign people automatically puts a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well during the conversation, and French was the only language in a decade-to-date percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially the language of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while looking at 2020, others will be able to teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, including specialist teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an education environment that will prepare children and create them with the skills needed to succeed in the future, no matter what.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages should truly be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity and enthusiasm for the youth of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut at Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron James's wait for fans to see his first trip to Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudeau, a reporter for Lakers, tweeted that James would probably play for a limited time.
After practicing earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a prison game to prepare for this stage of my career," he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump stormed a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including a stop at a friendly location with Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote to confirm his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court pauses, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is it at Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you see it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak this week about the Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh's hearing, which has sparked an expected Senate confirmation vote during the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.
But the opening of these rallies is aimed at helping Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to "emphasize volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that we will travel to as many states as possible as we can as we enter the busy campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbenko Arena at Wheeling, today's rally "may bring in supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is Trump's second visit to West Virginia since last month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
In the run-up to Trump's election, West Virginia is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Mauritius that the president needs to try to encourage him more in the election," said Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA looks hungry for hope in Sunday's singles
The third round of the tournament was held on Saturday afternoon at the end of three rounds.
The swing of the pendulum of the momentum is a completely invented sport concept but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such competition.
Where are you going to tell Mommy?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we now have a little momentum," Jordan Spieth said, as he walked for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with 12 more games remaining, they are ahead by four points.
As Spieth said, Americans think they have some help along the way and they can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and both of them have taken four to three points each.
Spieth was fatal from the beginning to the end and was leading from the front.
As his round progressed, the loud shouts of celebration were getting louder, when he and Thomas were still two points behind, scoring two points each, making it as important as handing over a full four-point square match.
His side that won the match in 15 received the same kind of shouts, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You really have to go deeper and think about your own match," Spieth said.
That's what every player has now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are the only franchises who have played the fairy tale of the Ryder Cup between Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but adorable pairs of four and four can't make a mistake.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they skipped the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning at nine in the back.
That run, and the way their energy was flowing in and out of this enthusiastic crowd, looked like they were the players who were defeated on Sunday, and there was no other potentially popular player to seal the European victory without Fleetwood or Mulinari as the sun goes down at Le Golf National.
It's better if both are in different places at the same time.
However, the glory of the Europeans has remained unchanged.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made some problems for the morning's foreball hero Sergio Garcia when they were paired up with Alex Noren.
In the first nine, a bogey and two double Spaniards and Swedes were thrown into a hole from which they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
The interaction between the pair binds, the advice that they give, the advice that it does not, and the strategy that can change instantly is very interesting to see from around Forebal and Foresome.
Europe has played relatively well as a team so far and has taken an important lead on the final day, but this foursome session has further proved that there is a hunger for team USA to fight something that, especially Stateside, suspected.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will take a 10-6 lead against the United States from Saturday's Forebol and Foursome matches.
Encouraged pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have led the Tigers to a double win over the two-time champions, taking their tally to four points at the Golf National.
Thomas Jürn's European team, bidding to recover the lost trophy in Hazeltin two years ago, won the series 3-1 by blowing the defective American side in the morning foreballs.
The United States offered more resistance to Forsam by winning two matches, but they could not meet the deficit.
Jim Furyck's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to restore the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Molinari, together "Mollywood" are only the second pair to win four points from the first four matches in the Ryder Cup history after a remarkable weekend.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reid to the foreballs and then jailed Woods to a loser and superbly to beat American Rucky Bryson Dekambu more vigorously by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself out of two games on Saturday, was sometimes a whirlwind of brightness, but now he has lost 19 of 29 matches in Forbes and Forsam and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning for the foreballs, returned to Forsam partner Henrik Stenson in the 2nd and 1st defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepoker - world number one and three.
A pleasant, windy day on the south-west side of Paris although it was not on its own side in Europe.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a strong 2 and 1 win over Spain's Joan Ram and Ian Poulter at Forbes, and returned after losing the opening two holes in Forbes, defeating Polter and Rory McLaroy at 4 and 3.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point deficit in a singles, although as of now, Furyck only needs a draw to recover the side's trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack looks like it will surpass them.
North Korea has said it will not unilaterally denuclearize the country without "belief in any way."
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that existing sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and there was no chance the country unilaterally gave up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant congratulatory measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests last year, dismantling the nuclear laboratory, and promising not to increase the proliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.
“But we haven’t seen any similar reaction in the US,” he said.
“We will also have no confidence in our national security if there is no confidence in the United States, and in such a situation there is no way we can unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri was describing North Korea's accusations against Washington's "stealth" approach to nuclear disarmament that would be rewarded for North Korea's slow action, his remarks seemed significant because he did not unilaterally abandon nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Reagan cited a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
They also objected to the declaration that “America “emphasized disarmament-first” and increased the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objectives with compulsiveness, even “the end of the war,” Ri said.
"The idea that bans can jeopardize our soil is a dream come true for those of us who don't know."
But the problem is that the constant sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
There was no comment on the plan for a second summit between Ri Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president presented to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If this issue of disarmament had been South Korea without the United States, the disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been so unstable.”
Yet, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a suicide "rocket man."
At the United Nations this year, Trump, threatening to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must continue until North Korea is disarmament.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no timeframe for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months to do it - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Americans on Thursday that: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be effective until we fully realize verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rea at the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
He said while leaving Pyongyang in July that some progress had been made, only a few hours before North Korea condemned him for making "guilty claims"!
North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes "similar measures."
He said that what Kim was looking for was a security guarantee that Trump had given to Singapore and a security guarantee that he was moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
The students of Harvard are getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year offers a way for all its graduates to get more sleep to deal with the growing culture of studying the "nightmare awakening" of the caffeine-fueled "nightmares."
An academic has discovered that students at the number one university in the world are often confused about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
The course was created by Charles Sizilla, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on the education sector.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why is it so long since I was told that I was in my senior year?’
He said, "Nobody ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
This course, which began for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits help students with academic and athletic performance, as well as what is needed to improve their general health.
Paul Barrera, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health care department, said the university had decided to launch the course after students were seriously deprived of sleep this week.
An hour-long course consists of several interrelated tasks.
A section contains images of a dormitory room, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on coffee cups, screens, instructors, and books, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and realizing the importance of a bedtime routine.
In other sections, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you decide to smoke cigarettes, but also have the right to know its effects on health," said Prof. Sizilla.
He said the culture of pride of “being awake all night” still exists, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
A student should be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety to ensure adequate quality sleep, he said - even sleep deprivation makes the brain hungry, making them constantly hungry."
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Sizillar design the course, taking a class at Harvard last year during her first year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes to urge all postgraduate students to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Sizilla recommended that students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can destroy your circadian rhythm, resulting in sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manger's goal defeats Gerard's lead.
The Rangers lost another one-off match to Steven Gerrard's random team Livingston 1-0 in Dolly Manger's goal.
After winning 4-1 at St. John's in February, Ebrox's team looked for another win, but Gary Holt's team gifted Gerard's second defeat as manager in 18 matches, which took him eight points away from the Hearts at the top of Ladybroke's Premiership.
Menga was injured seven minutes before half-time but the hopeful Rangers line-up never gave them a token.
Rangers have now moved down to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third and overtakes Hibernians by a goal difference.
And there could be more problems for Rangers as Linesman Callum Spence had to be treated for head injuries for an object thrown from the Ave Marathon.
Gerard has made eight changes in the team that have made him to the top spot in the Batfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livy 11 that took a point from the Hearts last week and should be proud of the way his well-equipped team repulsed the opponent.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with their balls.
Mengar sent Scott Pittman to McGregor's goal for the first time in just two minutes, but the midfielder wasted his chance.
Keghan got a long free-kick from Jacobs captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to hit the ball in the back post.
The Rangers regained control but had more hope than they believed in playing in the final third.
Alfredo Morlos must have felt that he and Steven Lawless should have received a penalty in the quarter-hour due to the collision but referee Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian's application.
Rangers could only target two shots on target in the first half, but former Ebrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by the head and Ovy Azariya's shot of Lasana Kulibali.
Levy's 34th minute opening goal may have been against the game's stream, but no one can deny that they are the only ones who deserve this design.
Again, it didn't work out for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond to Deacon Gallagher's call for Scott Robinson's ball to be slotted, keeping his head cold to pick Menga for general finishing.
Gerard took an action at the break with Ryan Kent to replace Coolibly and the change was going to work almost immediately as the winger was in Morales, but the extraordinary Kelly moved him from the line to the block.
But Livingston began to play exactly the kind of game that visitors enjoyed, sending long balls to Lithgow and Halkett after a long ball.
Holt's team could have taken their lead in the finals, but McGregor had to resist Jacobs' efforts before heading from Lithgow Corner.
Thomson turned his back on Glenn Middleton, a subsidiary of Late Penalty.
Almanac: The inventor of the guitar counter.
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years from today...the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Guyger was born in Germany.
Gigger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a device eventually known as the Gigger Counter.
Since then, a core of science, Guyger Counter has also become the core of a pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring seemingly promising Cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Del Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium, a gaeger counter.
When you give these earphones to the bride, you can hear the effects of the atoms given by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Does that make a lot of noise?"
"Hans" Guyger died shortly before his 63rd birthday in 1945.
His discovery is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and are then re-introduced.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients with different levels of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the common proteins of many cancers called HER2, and then re-introducing the cells.
Professor J. Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "produces a wide variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer," explains Professor Barzofsky.
A similar approach has also worked to treat leukemia in order to "teach" patients to extract immune cells outside and "how to target cancer cells."
Kanye West gets involved in pro-Trump controversy with a MAGA hat
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed into the studio after a lengthy performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would continue in office in 2020.
After serving his third night song called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they say: “How do you like Trump, he’s racist!”
"Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have come out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a skeleton starring Matt Damon, where Hollywood star Christine Blaise joked about Brett Cavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on claims of sexual abuse by Ford.
Although it hasn't aired, West's satirical footage of comedian Chris Rock has been uploaded on social media.
It's not clear if the West is trying to hide from the West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he also had to face backstage problems with his headwear.
"They put me in the backseat.
He said, "Don't take your hat off."
They've spoiled me!
And then they say I'm in a sinking place," according to the Washington Examiner's source.
West added: “Do you want to see the place?” Saying that he would read his own “Superman Cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do.” “Do you want to see the world moving forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members were outraged, Variety reported, where one person told the publication that: “There was a pin-down silence in the entire studio.”
West was brought up as an alternative to singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West's love of music has made a lot of people confused by decorating a peripheral bottle in the performance of the song.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: thank you for standing up against evildoers.”
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was what it was and is absolutely great."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art" who is embracing and spreading harmful ideals for my community."
He is independent.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West."
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> She is not the first artist to change her name, and DD, known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, and PDD, has followed her path.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol that was previously known as Prince.
Allegations of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Bali.
The accused is scheduled to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacked the Toxic Masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as Zone Snow in HBO's offensive medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor said that playing such a role on screen means giving young boys the impression that they have to be tough to get respect.
While talking to the Sunday Times culture, Kitt said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married Rose Leslie, the co-star of her Game of Thrones, at the age of 31, has admitted that she feels stressed about the problem.
"I personally feel, quite strongly, right now - where are we misbehaving in masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, that we are facing this problem now?"
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its supermassive characters.
He said: "What are we learning and what are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that boys feel they have to follow this particular path to be men?
I think that's really one of the biggest questions of the day - how do we change that?
"Because obviously the young people made some big mistakes."""
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series will be re-released next summer, saying he had ended the life of "the battlefield and the horse."
From November onwards, Kit will be starring in Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his stolen brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it's my future family gifted my life."
The Rose Emmy award-winning fantasy series starred Igrit, Kitt's character as John Snow's lover.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS cases.
There are more than 820,000 cases in the country, health officials said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were caused by sexual transmission, which changed from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infections have spread rapidly to various parts of China for blood circulation.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been brought down to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection through sex is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still considered manifest.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry women later.
Many infections come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies GOP senators' data leaks, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
WASHINGTON - Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of its staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat firmly claimed that these claims were being promoted by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The data released included the address and phone number of U.S. Senators. Senators. Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utter in South Carolina.
An unidentified man posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Cavana.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholars and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the post was linked to the "Waters" office and revealed information about which member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"These baseless accusations are a complete lie and a perfect lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identities, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - were not in any way responsible for this information leak."
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a perfect lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This denial is infuriating," Fischer wrote.
"It shows that he has no inclination to become a member of Congress.
They don't get angry when someone is accused of something they haven't done.
They will not be contested.
They must not question the intention of the complainant.
They must be calm and gentle."
Fliccher, who was comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, felt critics were too angry at him during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is choosing to sack Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's really big," he said.
In a statement, Waters said his office had "alert appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and my staff will be legally held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of them."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Weak Rowan Atkinson Spy
It is now traditional to see the significance of Brexit in any new film, including British diagonal, and it seems to be applicable to the revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy Spoof Franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is there any way to make sure that the nation we're going to be able to get rid of the waste?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-headed Johnny English has the license to create new things for the second time - more than anything else his name indicates that he created an extensive comic designed for the world of cinema in languages other than English.
He is of course the stupid secret representative who, despite the bizarre trend of smooth glitter, is somewhat tied up, a dash of Mr. Bean and a dollop of chap made a note contribution to the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony Shariats of Fire Theme Town in London.
He is primarily based on Traveler and played in the international mystery man Atkinson once-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, spreading chaos in the cognition.
There are one or two great moments in this last JE outing.
I'd love to see Johnny English come close to a helicopter while the rotor blades were hanging with a little helmet in a medieval armored robe.
Atkinson's gift for physical comics is showing up, but the joke has been felt quite low-quality and strangely overrated, especially with "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offering the comics as an element of confidence.
The joke sounds like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's bizarre accidents are not as innovative and centralized as Atkinson's silent-film jokes on Bean's personality.
For many years, the topical basis was that Great Britain was in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker penetrated Britain's ultra-secret web network of espionage, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to frustrate the responsible agent - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last confidence of a prime minister who is already suffering from a complete recession of political dissent, he is a reckless and bound figure: Emma Thompson has done her best with this semi-terrese-may character but there is not much to do on the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to get someone out of retirement.
And that means talking to Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher at some of the pubs, but teaches beyond the records about how to be a disguised worker: there are some good jokes here, as the English offer the Rock-type Academy School of Detectives here.
The English returned to Whitehall for emergency briefings and again reunited with his former long-tolerant Sidekick Bauer starring Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a Jolly-Hockey-Stick in which Vicky Pepperdine has been somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who made a fatal mistake in the Har Magister's Secret Service, returned to action and faced Olga Kurelenko's infamous Ophelia Bolitova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the magic of a billionaire with charismatic technology, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the papacy Jason Volta starring Jack Lacy.
English and Bau begin their far-reaching high-jink strange sounds: in the disguise of the waiter they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they start fighting by smuggling themselves into the luxurious boat of Volter; and the English Volter tries to use the virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of the house by creating authenticity.
All the stops are of course drawn for the final sequence, but as much as it's candid and cheerful, there are quite a few children's TV looks on the whole thing.
A very average staff.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn’t have imagined: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that it plans to work four days a week on behalf of Briton, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a key plan that will see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
The group, according to the report, wants the company's owners to share the money they saved with employees on an extra day off through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will see employees enjoying a three-day holiday - but still earn the same salary at home.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the economic program of the party and there are plans to move the country in favour of the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has approved the move to a four-day week as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"It won't happen overnight but the four-day workday is an aspiration that fits with the team's approach to balance the economy in favour of the workers as well as the overall industrialization of the party."
Not the first to support such a notion, the Green Party promised a four-day workday during their 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working day is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return power to utility companies from 'unidentified directors' and 'profiters'.
Shadow Chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to get their full share back because the labor government may give some 'outs' due to the wrong done to them.
He also confirmed plans to place staff on the company board and create an inclusive proprietary fund to justify 10% of the employees of private sector companies, whose annual dividend stands at $500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy "60 Minutes" to Tell If the FBI Investigation in Cavanna Could Change Their Minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the Bureau's investigations have raised questions about whether a Republican senator could turn his back on his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Peley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could invent something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I told him to go to the hearing, I told him I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, the complaint came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, unwavering.
Graham's vote, of course, seems unchangeable.
"My heart has been made up about Brett Kavanaugh and a big pretty important complaint will need to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And they did not test him whose name he had said.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that stars have a great line-up of performances and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will not only see thousands of people roaming the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an expansion of the global poverty project, a group that hopes to alleviate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting internationally.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do multiple tasks or other meaningful ways to help them raise awareness of their goals such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other poverty alleviation.
How many people have been successful in achieving their goals for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert a real step to persuade people to take action, or another case of so-called "clicktivism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing an online application or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says the moves have helped world leaders announce more than $37 billion in equal commitments and policies that will impact the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team cited 390 commitments and announcements that began with its operations, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or fundraised.
The group estimates that the protected funds have so far had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to "helping children maximize their full potential," with Global Citizen's commitment to provide 35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the help of UK governments, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The team also said that after taking more than 5,000 steps in the United States to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced to pay for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-racism movement before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Genel Moni are among those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be performed by Deborah-Lee Farnese and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Russia's energy exports to "block" the navy - Home Secretary
Washington may "necessarily" take refuge in its navy to prevent Russian fuels from arriving in the Middle East countries, according to the Washington Examiner, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinc has revealed.
Zinc has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to visit the new fuel market.
"I believe their position in the Middle East is because they want to power brokers like Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to take action against it.
"The United States with our navy has the power to keep sea routes open and, if necessary, to block their fuel so that it does not go to market," he said.
Jinke was speaking to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identifies as the "voice of fuel consumers" in the United States.
He was comparing Russia and Iran to Washington's use of them in the real world.
"Russia is concerned with the benefits and replacements from less fuel," he said, referring to a "sleeping card" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The Trump administration is aiming to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to European consumers instead of Russia.
Under its influence, including a Trump administration official, US President Donald Trump himself is trying to get Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, it is being held in the hands of Berlin Moscow."
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the existing pipeline's capacity to 110 billion cubic meters - is a fully financially viable project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than financial and is an example of unequal competition.
"In my belief, we agree that energy cannot be used as a pressure tool and should have the ability to choose suppliers of customers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after an interview with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has received negative reactions from Germany, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry body, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kampf, said: "We have a major problem with the interference of a third state in our energy supply.
"Elizabeth Warren will be seen as a candidate for the 2020 Presidential election," said the Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "figure in" her candidacy for president after the interim election.
Warren, a town hall in Holloway, Massachusetts, confirmed that he was in competition.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes getting women in top positions," she said.
"After November 6, I will vigorously contest the presidency."
During Warren Town Hall, President Donald Trump said he was "wrongly steering the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and Trump's nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote," Warren said in a tweet on Friday.
According to a survey published on Thursday, most of Warren's own voters don't think he should contest the 2020 election.
A Boston Globe poll at the University of Suffolk found that 85 percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said the Senate should not vote.
Thirty-two percent of the population supported the war.
The survey found that former governor Deval Patrick's vote was more in support of the fight, with 38 percent supporting the possible fight and 48 percent not.
Other high-profile Democrats likely to contest the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes track Pauline's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was charged with domestic violence on Monday.
"Through the return of my own son, through whom he is going through, I understand the other families who understand the consequences of PTSD and some of the damage our soldiers are going through," he told reporters at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "elephant at home" and told his son and other war veterans that "they came back with a bit of change, they came back strong, they came back wondering if they had any respect for the colleagues they had given to the army, the air force, and other members of the military."
He was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and a police department spokesman, Dan Bennett, said a woman had been charged with domestic violence, possession of weapons, and drug possession.
18 states, DC supports the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges against the new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
In order to support a asylum seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name, filed in August against the American Civil Liberties Union federal policy in the Grace V. Sessions case, has not been released.
He said his accomplices "and his violent gang member boys" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys from the supporting states of Grace cited examples from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as a country facing widespread gangs and family violence, from which a large number of applicants came to seek asylum in the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of state, federal, and international law."
In the Friend-of-the-Court brief, it is stated that "according to this federal law, all refugee requests must be judged according to specific information and circumstances, and such restrictions violate the main purpose."
In the statement, the attorneys also argue that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide essential labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer shelter victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Those who have had to leave their own country due to persecution or fear for membership or political views in a particular social group, religion, nationality or ethnicity can be granted asylum," Sessions said in its June 11 announcement of its policy.
Asylum is never meant to solve all problems - even all fatal problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled in the rescue efforts and the desperate rescue efforts in Palau
The situation for the survivors was appalling.
“In Palu city shelter, 35-year-old Lisa Kusuma asked to comfort her fever-ridden baby,” it was very worrying.”
"There's an ambulance coming every minute.
There is no clear water."
In an effort to find what was found in the water, residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and a 7.5-magnitude quake hit hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Doyle Harris, whose back and shoulders were broken, have been kept out of the Palu Army Hospital, undergoing treatment under the skies due to a strong subsequent tremor.
He wept when he was in a five-storey hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save them.
"I was stuck in the middle of a broken wall, I think," Harris told the media representative, adding that they had come to the city for a wedding ceremony.
"I can hear my wife's screams for help, then silence."
I don't know what happened to my kids.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador to the United States has accused China of "misusing propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to carry out targeted campaigns.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the Des Moines Register, the largest Chinese daily in Iowa, and accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congress election, China has denied the allegations.
Trump has accused Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election, which U.S. officials told Reuters was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is natural that foreign governments will advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war as a result of which they have increased the amount of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs were designed early in the trade war to harm exporters to states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an article in the Des Mines Register on Sunday, Branstad said that China "has now doubled that brutality with our own free press purposeful advertising."
"The Chinese government is taking an immoral advantage of American freedom of speech and the free press's cherished history in this propaganda campaign through paid advertising on the Day Mines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will find limited opposition voices in the newsstand on the side of Beijing's street and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's dissent about China's worrying economic path, because the media is here at the behest of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that his writing "refused to print a major newspaper in China," although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans want to keep women's electorate away before the midterms, analysts warn
In the face of numerous allegations of sexual harassment by many top Republicans, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has stood up and hidden, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction from women, especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion around the issue has grown to an extent, and it appears that most Republicans are already willing to go public with the vote.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Riher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill, “They cannot return in any way.”
Rihar said it was doubtful whether Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona)'s pressure on the FBI to investigate would calm angry voters at the last minute.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and November," said Carin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the Progressive Movement group and national women's spokesman, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a protest in the Senate hall on Friday morning, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, Mic said.
"Independent political analyst Stuttgart told the news site, "Democratic zeal and inspiration will be the past of accounts.
"People say there's too much; it's true.
But it could be even more, especially among the underdeveloped female voters in the suburbs, and among young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't vote often because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford publicly testified about the allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there could be an adverse presidential action if the Republicans advance with approval.
"This has become a complex issue for the GOP," Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kafanoff will be left behind, it's also about how Republicans have taken the issue and how they've used it," Guy Cecil, director of the Prairie USA Group, who supports Democrats in the vote, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a bit hesitant about who to trust in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with opinions weighing heavily on the next one.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony to be certain or perhaps, while 35 percent said they believed Cavanoff.
Also found, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied when he received his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Fleck's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford was sworn in last week and testified before the Judiciary Committee that he was harassed by Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court's nominee showed her her genitals at a party while she was studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web are planning to launch a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This is the latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, a company that will build Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Users of Solids have the right to choose where their data will be stored and which information will be allowed to be accessed by people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real purpose of Indrap was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create a P&D or "Personal Online Data Store" using Solid's technology.
This may include contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like getting Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it will depend entirely on the user - who can access what kind of information.
The company is called "Personal Empowerment by Date."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea will help bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to get everyone's solids.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a team of some contracted on-site developers and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools that exist on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "will launch a complete change with Facebook and Google where all of their business models will be completely changed overnight."
"We do not ask permission from them."
Berners-Lee wrote in a post on Medium published on Saturday that Inrapt's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Burners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Burners-Lee has emerged as a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm optimistic about this future era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Celebrating the Victoria Cross Cleric of the First World War
The city of Adi celebrates the centenary of the Church of England's only pastor who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van Award was won on September 29, 1918, during the invasion of Bellingleys and Lehanncott.
However, he was killed by an assassin four days later and he never knew he had received the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled his monument at a sightseeing in Northamptonshire, Russia.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extraordinary significance" that the monument was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's death.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van "led his battalion through thick fog and fierce shelling of field and machine guns" during the de Saint-Quentin Canal Peroner.
He then ran to the firing line and led the line with the "highest courage" by simply combining a field song and throwing three enemies.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German attacker on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I could never have done and that's tremendously respectful."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuchkawaz, gave floral tributes to the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "very honoured to participate in the parade" and added, "a true heroic hero is being shown in support of a lot of people."
MMA fans woke up all night to watch the 206 Beloto, but instead they found Pepa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night to watch a great Beltar 206 and the main event has not been shown.
The bill received from San Jose had 13 fights, including six, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six in the morning, while Gagard Moussassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed to Pepa Pig and shocked the UK audience.
They woke up early in the morning and some people were upset.
A fan on Twitter described changing children's cartoons as "a kind of dirty joke."
"They were forced to change the children's cartoons because it was not appropriate to show such shows at 6 a.m. as per government rules," said Dave Schwartz, Belto's senior vice president, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Pepe the Pig," Yes
Scott Koker, president of Bellator, said he would work on a timetable for future UK visitors.
"Maybe we can fix it during the replay," Cocker said.
"But now it's six o'clock on Sunday and our Sunday, they can't do it until Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it is switched on, there are a lot of messages and they were not very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
No, it was a government thing.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll cut it down to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - in an effort to give fans more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Disk: Tom Daly suffers from "disobedience" due to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he suffered from sexual dysfunction when he was growing up - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not understand until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights in providing "hope" to others.
He also said that after the birth of the child, his thoughts about winning the Olympics have diminished.
Christy Young, a regular presenter of this long-running event, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Attending Laverne's first event as a sociologist, Deli said she felt "smaller" than everyone else, because "the choice of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
She said: “To this day, it remains real to feel small and to feel isolated that has given me the strength and determination to succeed.”
She said she wanted to prove herself as "something" so that when everyone knows about her sexuality, everyone would not be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has used his presence to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he opened his mouth, because he felt lucky to be alive in public without complications and wanted to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion talks about falling in love with a man—American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013—which “would surprise me.”
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her. She said there was no problem with the age gap.
"When you face so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone who was the same age as someone who had seen so many climbing ups in his life.
The couple gave birth to a son in June named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said his "whole point of view" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would have said, ‘I have to win a gold medal’.
"To be honest, there's something bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
It's my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 of brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daley said his father never admitted that he was going to die and that he had finally asked if his ticket for London 2012 was confirmed - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I never said you'd be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he breathed his last and died, and I didn't admit that he was invincible," she said.
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"It's been my dream all my life - to dive into the Olympics in front of my audience, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired her first song choice - Heather Small's Proud - which resonated with her in preparation for the Olympics and which still bites her.
Dessert Island disc on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Michaelson sits on the bench at the Rider's Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Rider Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to return to form if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played 12 times in a record-breaking biennial event, was forced to sit on a bench at Saturday's Foreball and Foursome instead of Captain Jim Furrick.
Instead of being at the center of the move, which he played in the United States, the five-time major winner has spent his day working as a cheerleader and reeling in the range.
Not always comfortable among drivers even at the top of the career, this 48-year-old is not suitable for the tight-leaf golf national course, where the long raffle often gets in the way of long shots.
And if the course itself isn't bad news, Michaelson, in the No. 9 match, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who paired up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win four of their matches this week.
If Americans, who have four points down at the start of the 12 singles match, can start well, Michaelson's matches can prove to be important.
Farouk showed confidence in him, though he didn't have much to say.
"He understands his role today, he puts his hand on my shoulder and says he's ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a great player and he's done a lot for the team this season.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought we'd move forward.
He wants to get on the field, just like everyone else."
Michaelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most rider's cup matches in Sunday's game.
It could end up in a Ryder Cup career that doesn't even cover his personal record.
Michealson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven half-centuries, although Furyck said his presence boosted the team.
"He's a funny, funny, intelligent, loving people, and a great guy to be in the team room," he said.
"I think the new players have had a lot of fun playing with him this week as well, which is great to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe captain Thomas Bojran knows that even the big lead can disappear.
Thomas Björn, the European captain, knows from experience that a major lead in the Ryder Cup's final day in the singles could create an uncomfortable situation.
Dan's debut was in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Savi Balesteros won five points to the Americans, but somehow crossed the finishing line to 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 in just the narrowest margin.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderrama, where we won, but by a nominal margin," said Björn, who is seen in the film, ahead of the 2018 class 5-3 at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday.
"History will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over yet.
I'm going to be full of enthusiasm tomorrow.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until the board is reached.
We have a goal, it's to try and win the trophy, and that's where we'll have our bird's eyes.
I've always said that I look at 12 players in my team, but we're also very aware of who's on the other side - the best player in the world."
"I'm happy with the hard work our players have done on the golf course," Bjorn added. "I'll never be over-confident about it.
Tomorrow is a different battle.
Tomorrow will be a different day, and it will be different.
It's great to be with a partner when all goes well, but when you're alone in the field, your abilities as a golfer are fully tested.
This message needs to reach out to all the players, who have to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner and move on and do the best you can."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyck will keep an eye on the players who have played in person as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who have picked up three of the four points.
As part of the "Medina Miracle" that took place in Europe and the winning team in Brooklyn, Fury himself has experienced both sides of dramatic change in the last days.
Asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had inspired his players before landing in 1999, he said, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you'll want to get rid of a quick start like Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game is leaned on one side, there is a lot of pressure on the middle side games.
We're going to line-up accordingly and name the boys the way we thought we would, so we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rams, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter have been given the responsibility to lead the top-order to prevent Thomas against the Europeans. He will face Rory McLaury in the opening match.
"I have arranged this team in this order, because in my opinion it will cover everything," Björn said of his singles selection.
Germany's new warship has been decommissioned.
The T was supposed to be launched in 2014 with the latest team from the German Navy to replace the previous Cold War-era warship, but not until at least next year due to faulty systems and snowballing costs.
The newspaper said the new Baden-Wurttemberg-class frigate's first ship "Rhineland-False" has been suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project was in trouble due to post-delivery problems.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships to replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is learnt that they will have powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reducible radars, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it will be possible to deploy new frigates for a maximum of two years away from the country's ports.
However, the continued delay means that the sophisticated warships - which Germany is supposed to help with energy demonstrations abroad - will be outdated at the time of the sinking, Dey Jett's news.
The F-125 frigate was named last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vessel and sent it back to the Bloom and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship has been sent back to the shipbuilder after delivery by the Navy.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that would make the ship ineffective in the war.
The gauze of the software is particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - which is half the manpower of the old Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it was found that the ship was overheated which would reduce its performance and create obstacles on the way to adding future upgrades to the Navy.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-False" is believed to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
The initial level has risen from <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The new refrigerators have become even more important in the wake of Germany's recent warning of shrinking naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bertels, head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was "floating its suitable ship."
The official said that the problem has been huge over time, as no replacement ships were brought to the old ships that had been cancelled.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Württemberg class was able to join the navy.
The Secret Life of the Trustees
A new study is being conducted in an estate in the Scottish Mountains to find out how bats use landforms in search of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help in future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue to research the common and soprano pipesirelles and the Dubenton bats from the Invervue Gardens in Wester Ross.
The special recorder will be placed in important places around the area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
The sound of all recordings will be analyzed by the expert and the frequency of bat call can be calculated and reported on what species is doing.
A landscape map and report will then be created to create detailed geometric-scale images of their behavior.
NTS' Nature Conservation Consultant Rob expects that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands and how to protect forests for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly.
They are in danger for building and development work that damages their sleeping places and habitats.
Wind-based turbines and lighting can also be hazardous, such as flypapers and some chemicals of building materials, as well as pet cats may be at risk of attack.
The mouse isn't really blind.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes when it comes to hunting at night because of their hunting habits.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify dangers and obstacles on the way to flying.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to bats.
They have ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, visit sleeping places, and sometimes even rescues.
The company also set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat conservation space at Dumfries and Galloway's Three Estates, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the real estate manager, said the property is ideal for bats.
"There's a good area for three bats here," he said.
"There are old buildings, there are many old trees and all good habitats.
But much more about bats is still unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to survive.”
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining the property, as it could inadvertently destroy 400 mammals and infant bats due to the destruction of a maternal home, and wipe out the entire number of local bats.
It is illegal for bats to be protected and killed, harassed or harassed or destroyed their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer in the Fleet Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about nuts, and we don’t know much about how many species live.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and lawyers are going to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper
Describing the rape charge brought against him as "fake news", he said people wanted to "enhance their identity" by taking his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has brought the accusations to the public.
The Portuguese and Juventus forwards have been accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Maworga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of giving her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, the Der Spiegel report said on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, while talking to his 142 million followers on Instagram live video hours after the claim went public, described the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
"What they said today is false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"They want to know my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by my name, but it's part of life.
"I'm a happy person and everything is going well," the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unacceptable reports of being suspected of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player would have to seek compensation "for the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident occurred at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga met at a nightclub and went to the player's house, where he allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo apologized and told him that he was "99 percent disappointed" for "good people," "one percent."
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that he had gone to the police and had been photographed with his injury in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the courtroom, as he was "fearless of revenge" and feared being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she now wants to revive the settlement because she is mentally disturbed by the alleged incident.
At the time of the crime, Ronaldo had joined Real Madrid from Manchester United and joined Italy's famous club Juve in a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ losing its position as car maker
Commerce Secretary Greg Clarke said the UK would "forever regret" losing its position as the first in the world to make cars after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrisome" that the UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that people could lose their jobs due to border delays in Brexit without a deal.
Bernston's factory - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avenis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory may stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Burnston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the European Union without a deal on how to handle cross-border trade.
For example, BMW said they would shut down their mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns that car manufacturers are saying is the risk of a supply chain in case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with every 37 minutes the intrusion comes from suppliers from both the UK and the UK for the ordered vehicle.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays in supply and a crisis of supply, according to the trade giant.
The company said that it is not possible to keep inventory worth more than one day at the Toyota Derbyshire plant, which could lead to a production stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's checkered plan for future EU relations was "appropriately formulated to avoid such checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will not only keep the success, but it will also make it possible to enjoy the potential for future improvement,” he said at today’s event on BBC Radio 4.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers have evidence that it is very important to continue the successful arrangement of the supply chain."
Toyota is unable to say how long production will be halted, but they have warned that additional costs in the long run will reduce the factory's competitiveness and may result in many jobs being lost.
Peter Suvalaris, a 24-year-old resident of Burnston and United Union convener of the plant, said its members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these things are done, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: “We need to have a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed.
Amid tensions over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the high-level meeting with Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosestein could be postponed "another week," the White House said Sunday.
Special adviser Robert Mueller, who oversees Russia's election interference, Trump's links with Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Washington has been battling for months over whether Trump will sack the deputy attorney general and put Mueller's independence under question.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported on the use of secret mics to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Roosevelt denied the report.
He was supposed to return to the White House on Monday in response to a report that he was about to resign.
Instead of a meeting with Trump announced on Thursday, Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to sack Rosenstein, but one of the women accused of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh and her, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, both testified, the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, for which the full Senate vote has been further delayed.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On his meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no fixed date, it could be this week, for all other current matters of the Supreme Court, it could be delayed by another week."
"I've always wanted to see the media."
Some journalists will oppose the statement, saying Sanders has not had any more press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders said that the reason for not keeping the briefing is not for "showing people" to journalists, although he said: "I don't deny that they've done things to show people."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The current president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any of his previous presidents," he said without mentioning any evidence: "We have judged that number."
"But if the media had the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, it would be much better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We try very hard to do this, and you have seen us do it over the past few weeks, and talking directly to the President of the United States is going to take place in place of the press briefing."
Trump regularly asked questions when leaving the White House or attending opening sessions or a press conference with prominent guests.
There is very little press conference.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why, unplanned work, and sometimes a strange presence in front of a journalist group.
Health Minister NHS Writes a Letter to EU Employees Concerning Brexit in Scotland
The Health Minister expressed his gratitude to the EU employees working in Scotland's NHS and expressed his desire to remain in post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before leaving the UK.
The Scottish government has already promised to meet the Settled Status application costs for EU citizens to work in the country's government services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Debates between the UK and the EU on Brexit are continuing throughout the summer, which is expected to result in this fall.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible deal-breaking situation.
I know you are all going through a difficult time.
That is why I want to remind you once again how valuable to me is the contribution of every member of the staff irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond have come up with valuable experiences and skills that have strengthened and improved health services and benefited patients and our community.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here.”
Christian's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee's Mike Organ said Christian Barakrambi, a linebacker for Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"She came to the sidelines and became a bit of a nuisance," Reid said.
The trainer and medical staff provided oxygen to the victim on the sidelines and later brought her back for further tests.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Vanderbilt was out of surgery this time at the medical center.
Harris added that "no details about the type/type of the injury are yet to be known" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
The second-year student, wearing red shirts, is playing his first season with the State of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles before leaving the game on Saturday, with a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK.
Under the Tory plan, when foreign buyers buy new property in the UK, they will have to pay a higher stamp duty and this extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
The move will pave the way for Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
When foreign buyers buy a property in the UK, they will have to pay more stamp duty - and this extra money will be spent with the help of homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will mitigate Corbyn's campaign's success in attracting young voters, as well as targeting housing supplies and high-income earners at a more affordable price.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to individuals and organizations that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used by the government to help the homeless.
Surcharges - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, could be higher than what was imposed on a second home and rental home two years ago.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly-created total assets are bought by residents outside the UK, for which prices have gone up and the situation has made it more difficult for first-time housing buyers.
Most of the elite areas of the country - especially the capital - are becoming "unfamiliar cities" in the crowd of foreign buyers spending most of the time abroad.
The new policy came weeks after the new administration called on the younger generation to reduce the Boris Johnson stamp duty to help them buy their first home.
She has accused big construction companies of raising property prices without buying land and using it, and called on Ms. Meek to cancel the quota of affordable homes to solve Britain's "habitat problem."
Mr Corbyn announced an interesting series of housing reform proposals, including the abolition of rental control and "no-fault" eviction.
He wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - which is that life should be more beautiful for everyone in the new generation.
This means that the market will be destroyed.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life.
However, it may not be right that foreign and foreign private companies that do not live in the UK will buy property as easily as hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is far from over, and the problem of homelessness remains a very real one.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate dream is to take charge of Scotland.”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become Scotland's manager someday in the future.
This 42-year-old Scotland resident is currently enjoying the challenge of restoring the Northeast club, who is now in third place in League One, three points behind the first team.
He brought St. Mary's back to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and so far," Ross told Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland's game at Hampden with my father as a child and it always pulls me back.
This opportunity can only come if I succeed in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Mayes, Sam Eldris, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canni, among others.
The former Alva Athletic boss said he felt no disappointment by rejecting the offer of a big name club like Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me right now will be, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
It is undoubtedly worthy of the Premier League because of the structure and facilities in this club," he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I’ll probably see myself as successful if I can bring the club back there.”
Ross's managerial life is currently only three years after he spent 15 months as assistant boss and coaching staff at Dumbarton.
He then helped Aloy to recover from the degradation to the third level and to transform St. Mirren from the degradation door to the championship winner in the next season.
And Ross said he's now feeling more comfortable here than Clyde, Hartlepool, Falcark, St. Mary's and Hamilton's academic playing careers.
"It was probably a real milestone," he recalled taking charge of Aloysius.
"I really believed that management is better for me than sports.
It sounds strange because I've done the right thing, lived quite a life out of it, and enjoyed some success.
But the game is hard.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same about the work pressure, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing on my own skin in my entire adult life."

According to the study, 5:30 p.m. on Saturday is the most ideal for pints.
The summer heatwave has increased the crowds in Britain's drizzling pubs, but it has put pressure on the restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but the restaurant's money collection fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
CGA's business consultant company Peter Martin, who compiled these figures, said: "The unpredictable sunshine and England's unexpected long-term participation in the World Cup mean that the same trend will continue in July as in June, when pub sales grew by 2.8 percent and restaurant sales fell."
Restaurant business fell by 1.8 percent in June to become even worse in July.
The main pubs and bars have been very good so far and the sale of restaurants has been worse.
The food major pubs are also suffering from heat failures, but have not been sold down like restaurants.
It's like people just go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages in all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, with food sales falling by three percent.”
Retirement and hospitality analyst Paul Newman of RSM said: "The trend towards the end of April continues.
Weather and large social or sporting events have the greatest impact on sales outside the home market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent drop on sales each year will be particularly painful.
For the food major operators, the long and hot summers cannot come at a bad time, and only time will tell whether the mild weather in August will bring some relief.”
In July, total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent, reflecting a decline in sales at brand roll-outs.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sector's Cofer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor has collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million, and is an established industry standard.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide to their parents.
The study revealed that one in five children - some 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "fake Insta" page
There have been reports of sexual harassment being reported.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "major" account to show their parents
One in five children - some only 11 years old - is creating a social media account to hide from adults.
A study among 20,000 secondary school students found a "fake insta" - image sharing site Instagram, with accounts showing a rapid growth trend.
There have been reports of sexual harassment being reported.
Twenty percent of students said they had a transparent "head" account to show their parents, as well as hidden.
A mother, who saw the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a teenager calling others to "rape me."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Elyth Doyle to be "Voice for Athletes" on Scottish Athletic Board
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive director.
Doyle described Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian BT as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elysium has great respect across the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community, and we are confident that bringing it to the Scottish athletics board will be of immense benefit," BT said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as a voice for athletes and I’m hopeful that I can really help Scotland’s sport and take it forward.”
This American, who won four Olympic gold medals in Atlanta in 1996, including 200 metres and 400 metres, and now a regular BBC scholar, has stopped walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I could not walk.
The doctor told me that I could get better.
It was a tough job, but now I've learned to walk again, I'm healthy, and I'm going to start exercising again today!
Thanks for the inspirational message!"
The Internet Is Distinguished in Comparing Mothers and Cows to Breast Pump Advertising
A breast pump company has split the opinion of the internet with an advertisement that compares baby mothers to breast-feeding cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is called the "world's first soundless breast pump," the consumer technology company LV has released a fun music video ad to showcase the freedom that the new pump gives modern mothers.
The four true mothers are dancing with a cow full of straw, with a song in which Lyrics include: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If no one sees, these are no animal's curls, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pumped, pumped, pumped, pumped, pumped, pumped, milked my girlfriends."
However, the advertisement, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has generated controversy online.
In 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers. Many have said it illuminates the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth, just like us, to produce milk, the difference is that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth."

Another commented: "It seems to be disappointing for both mother and child.
But why shouldn’t they be used in breast pump advertising for mothers who are close to their babies?”
Another said: "Extremely uncomfortable ads."
Others stood next to the ad, a woman admits that the song seemed "joyful" to her.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I had milk, I'd have one.
I feel like a cow when I'm pumping.
It's a bit crazy, but I'm good at it.
"It's an innovative product," he said.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad that's aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and think of themselves as "cows."
This advertisement does not praise or criticise the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women say they all danced with the hidden pump in their bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like cows while pumping their breasts.
Although the LV pump is completely noisy, it does not have a tube and fits nicely into the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to walk, put the baby in the lap, and even get out during pumping.
Anna Ballerine, Mother's Partner and ECD says: "LV Pump is a revolutionary product that should be started boldly and vigorously.
By drawing parallel images of women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, revealing the incredible feeling of release that the new pump will bring in in an entertaining and related way.
This is not the first time the LV pump has been placed in the news.
In London Fashion Week, a mother of two children used this product to walk to Katowice for designer Marta Zakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children have been taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the monthly border crossing remains relatively unchanged, as strict rules and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder for children to keep their sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves are afraid of losing the possibility of staying in their own country by demanding immigrants and children without paperwork.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor orphan children.
The agency later said that 70 per cent of those arrested had no past criminal history.
"Around 80 percent of the family members of sponsors or sponsors are illegally in the country and a large part of them are criminals.
So we're going to continue to search for them," said Nister Albens.
In an effort to bring children back to society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules that include the one-month detention period, which was earlier 60 days, according to asylum workers.
Many will appear before the immigration judge through a video conference call, not in person, during their trial for legal status.
Those who are considered ineligible will be immediately deported.
According to shelter workers and reports released from the system in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more acute in large centres such as Tornillo, where children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
They also said that if children are not mentally prepared or moved to the center without enough time to say goodbye to friends, many people may have a few times as many as they are already suffering from the trauma.
U.S., French and Turkish "emergency forces" have been asked to immediately withdraw from Syria.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, despite the country's eight-year war.
Moylem, who at the same time is the country's deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on the country's soil in the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate action."
"They have to leave without a warrant," he said.
Moylem stressed that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions of people have been forced to flee their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to fight "until all Syrian territory is cleared" against both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Asked about the refugees, Moylem said the situation was conducive to their return and that he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that have prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this repatriation," he said.
"They're dealing with the whole issue"
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib has provided an opportunity to move forward through political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
Moylem, however, stressed that the deal has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action would work against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be "destroyed."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moylem said the Syrian government's participation in the committee should be limited to "reviewing the passages of the current constitution," and he warned against unwarranted interference.
Trump won in the second round.
In this argument, Trump will win the 2020 re-election, as a large number of liberals expect his presidency to end prematurely due to impeachment and scandals.
Which will undoubtedly be the "most dramatic end of a president!"
So far, there has been no change in the opinion of the public.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time rating has more than doubled to nearly 1.05 million, and MSNBC's to nearly 1.6 million.
Fox News' average prime-time viewership has grown from 1.7 million last year to nearly 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings with nearly 3.5 million viewers on the big news night.
About a cabinet secretary who became president after the destruction of the Capitol in one attack, ABC Drama said, “It’s a fire that is attracting people, because it’s beyond our comprehension.”
There is another theory in the work of veteran comedians Neil Scovel and "Just the Funy Parts: Some Hidden Hard Truths from the Hollywood Boys Club."
He recalled a taxi ride ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked.
"She said, 'Because she's funny and funny,'" Mrs. Scovel told me.
This game also has some entertainment value.
Of course, things that arise from Washington, unlike anything else on TV, can determine Roe Five’s future. Wait to see if migrant families can reunite and what happens to the global economy.
Turning is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And despite that, a conscious citizen will go beyond understanding when you see a panel of experts arguing for six hours over the use of a "deep background" for Bob Woodward's "Fair" book, and a $15,000 Utpakhri-skinned bomber jacket used by Paul Manafort (The Washington Post said of Docter with "the thicker dress with the hubris"), and of Mr. Trump.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario again.
Regarding the daily rotational cast of the Trump Show and the daily plot change (fighting with the NFL, appreciating Kim Jong-un), Wheelhouse Entertainment's chief executive and producer of "Pon Stars" Brent Montgomery said, "Some of what he's doing is like a reality show, every night he's going with some funny jokes."

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there was 80 sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was still recording CNN to watch MSNBC sitting at home.
Brett Kavanaugh's face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"I remember when we used to do great shows in those days and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it might be a joke, but it's real."

In the mid-term elections, money flowed like flood waters.
It's no surprise that money is flowing in Pennsylvania's 17th vote, as two candidates are fighting for a single seat, courtesy of the Congressional District's reorganization.
The recently reorganized suburban Pittsburgh District Pittsburgh has brought Democratic Representative Conor Lamb into the fight - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting against Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, many of which are part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally unfairly structured to the advantage of the Republicans, which led to the reorganization of the map.
The election in the new 17th district is a contest between the major political parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was introduced in March after winning a nominal margin in the widely circulated special election of the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political pundits are a little ahead of the democrats.
El Salvador sentenced to life imprisonment for supporting U.S.
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, stepping back a little from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also had a hotel in Panama, but the partners later removed the Trump Organization's director team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that the Department of State's "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" led to the withdrawal of American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But punishment was announced only against El Salvador, who received nearly $140 million in American relief in 2017 in the drug-chain control, development, and economic aid sectors.
The proposed penalties, which included financial aid cuts and certain visa restrictions, could have been painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a measure to prevent immigrants from crowding into the United States last year.
But by mid-September, top officials in the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, effectively ending El Salvador's possibility of punishment.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will deliver a speech at the summit, scheduled for mid-October, to deliver a message of imports to the administration.
And the American ambassadors of the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on statements made by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs, on condition of anonymity.
His remarks were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and he also declined to be named.
Read History
The next inevitable event could be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has enough evidence on public records.
Mr. Mueller's investigation into whether Mr. Trump had any ties with Russia during the election was reportedly turning around.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take up his responsibilities, just as he is preparing to go back to the voters and eventually likely have to go to the jury with his colleagues.
There are many if-but-things, and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or his European complement.
We will have the choice of the inhabitants of the two shores of the Atlantic as to how long this conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials might have "coupled" against Hitler unless the West had stopped him and stood by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid killing for many years.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and in this, the overwhelming pace of democracy is sometimes accelerated, sometimes delayed.
This has happened in American history as well.
What should we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein has been in danger since it was published on paper last year that he secretly suggested recordings of the president and speculated about his own inability to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times reports were false.
"What if the FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is innocent in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
The big question is, are we going to have a Congressional midterm election that can blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail in this test, democracy will be gone for a long time.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who occupied my embassy.
He survived, fled to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a sabath lamp on a table marked with swastika.
With this history, how can I not be hopeful about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorans is hoping for a quick win in Vienna
The Rangers will play their own Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning against the Austrians after a great draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they will have a better chance of qualifying for the Europa League G group.
Midfielder Graham Dorans played his first game of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes they can get to a better place by relying on the result.
"This point is very important because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We came out on the field with confidence and got a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw tie seems to be a fair result.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
Thursday is another important day in Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will be a tough game, because they had good results in their last game, but I'm sure with the support of the audience we can get positive results.
"Last year wasn't very good, because of my injuries and the changes in the club, there are elements of good feeling in the current position.
Our team is very good and the boys are also enjoying the training.
"I hope that we can move forward and succeed, leaving last season behind."
Women are losing sleep at night thinking about saving for retirement.
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had an idea of how to deal with it, very few people spoke about it with their family members.
Nearly half of those surveyed said they spoke to their spouse about long-term ministry expenses.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action for this conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Know where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t express your wishes well enough beforehand, you won’t be able to prepare your family for your ministry.
Work with your mentor and your family to discuss where and how you want to take care of, as determining the cost of your choice is also very important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can look for solutions to deal with these costs.
Your financing choice for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, if you have money - a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy or self-insurance with your own assets to help with these expenses.
Resolve from your legal documents: Try to stay away from legal battles.
Take an appropriate healthcare proxy so that you choose a trusted person to supervise your medical care and that if you are unable to communicate, the professional will comply with your wishes.
Keep in mind the power of an attorney about your property.
Choose a reliable person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid correctly when you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little things: Imagine that your elderly parents are in need of some emergency treatment and are being taken to the hospital.
Are you aware of your current health and safety concerns?
Keep these things in a written plan so that you can be prepared.
"And it's not just an economic issue, it's also a matter of medicine," Martinez said.

His injuries were not serious and the police requested a witness.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll could rise later.
As communication was cut off, relief workers were unable to report on the Dongala Regency area north of Palu, which is located near the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been rescued from Palu since the disaster.
Some important information about Palu and Dongla on Sulawesi Island:
The capital of the Central Sulawesi state is Palau, located at the end of a narrow ravine on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donglala is a Regency that covers about 300 km (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The state's population in 2017 is estimated to be 299,200.
Fishing and farming are the main sources of economy in the central Sulawesi state, especially in the coastal areas of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but most of it is located in Morowali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by the tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed about 200 people in Dongal and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, there was a tsunami in Dongal, which killed nine people.
Indonesia is often hit by earthquakes as it is located in the Pacific Volcano.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake struck 14 countries off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, and killed 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal area, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nyas off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes the western capital of Sumatra near the city of Padang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, resulting in a 10-metre-high tsunami that struck dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the P.D. Jaya Regency in Aceh, triggering destruction and panic by inciting horrific memories of the 2004 tsunami.
Although there was no tsunami, more than 100 people died in the collapse.
2018: A major earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of Track Polyne, Alaska's governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Polyne, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin from Alaska has been arrested on charges of domestic violence and attempts to avoid arrests.
According to the police report, when a known woman went to call the police in connection with the incident, she snatched the phone from him.
Pauline has been placed in an unsecured bond of $500 in the custody of the Matt-Su Pratrial Facility, KTUU said.
He was produced in court on Saturday, where he claimed to be "certainly innocent."
He has been charged with a class A crime, which means he could face up to one year in prison and up to $250,000 in fines.
He is also charged with a B-class crime, which could result in a one-day jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Paul has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Philip.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police for the attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic violence and drug abuse.
His wife was accused of slapping him in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans Group criticised Sarah Palin for linking the boy's violent behavior to his PSTD service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The tremor was felt near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The video of the incident is circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered to take part in the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, a suspect involved in a terrorist attack in New York that left eight people dead.
It is alleged that Saipov, 30, used a home depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, so that cyclists and pedestrians were crushed.
In order to carry out the execution according to a notice filed in the New York South District praying the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov is "deliberately" killing eight people and "deliberately" inflicting serious injuries.
According to the court documents, both of them are sufficient to carry out the execution.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 charges against Saipov, including eight murders, usually brought in for organized crime, and four charges of violence and car destruction.
Citing the manner in which Saipov carried out the "violent, cruel and perverted" attack, prosecutors said it needed "adequate planning and prioritization."
“Cyfulo Habibulaevich Saipov whose family and friends are hurt, hurt and hurt because they are Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laura Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erles, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Mendoza.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's Southern District last executed more than a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953, against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The couple were both sentenced to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, did not express any remorse, the court said.
Police said they were pleased with the incident.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired by the ISIS video on his phone at home.
Police said he had also requested that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room.
He pleaded guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" with the council's decision.
“We think that the trauma of this incident will prolong in everyone involved in the decision to investigate the death penalty rather than granting a life sentence application,” Patton said.
Cyprov's legal team had earlier called for the death penalty to be abolished.
Tory said Nigel Farage should be given the task of negotiating a Brexit deal.
Nigel Farage vowed to “unite the masses” at the protest conference in Tory today.
The former WikiLeaks leader said the politicians "have received a touch of isolation" from Eurosceptics - while one of May's own MPs said he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Sister said at the Birmingham rally that if Mr. Farage was Brexit Secretary, the UK would already have come out of the EU.
But the ice cream that Mrs May is eating to keep her deeply divided ranks is once again clearer when she takes part in another anti-Brexit protest in the city of Tories.
One of the most pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit checkers is trying to keep the deal in the right direction amid the EU's attack.
His allies have insisted that despite opposition, a deal could be reached with Brussels - and would force EuropeSeptics and Labour to choose between their package and "disorder."
Mr. Solihale said at the live mins live rally that he wanted "chuck checkers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a colleague and be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have come out of it,” he said.
Wellinboro’s MP added: “I will support Brexit, but Chuck checkers are needed.”
To his opponents in the EU, he said: “We did not fight a world war to live by following
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bono has ruled out the possibility of changing public opinion after the 2016 vote. “The idea that the British people want to stay in the UK is completely untrue.”
Tory Brexit supporter Andre Jenkins was also at the rally, who told reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Checkers will not vote for the general public’s dislike, the opposition will not vote for our party’s people and activists who have brought us here.
Move the checkers and try to listen.”
In sharp language, to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Minister is thinking of her position where her promise should be kept.”
Mr. Farage said at the rally that if the 2016 referendum decision was betrayed, politicians should be forced to understand the “adverse situation.”
“It is now a matter of trust between people and politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re going to tell them, ‘If you do, we won’t let you escape.’”
To the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face the vicious cycle.
“We are driving the masses who have brought victory to our Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Anti-Brexit protesters marched for two hours through the city centre in Bermuda.
Brexit banners were displayed against the Tories after a team of workers was formed at the end of this week.
Labour leader Adonis mocked the Conservatives at the conference after suffering a security problem on a party app.
“Some people are telling us that they can maintain a seamless border, unobstructed free trade along the Irish border, Canada’s Plus and IT systems,” he added.
“This is a total mess.
"It's not a good Brexit," he said.
Warren is looking forward to a "serious" run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will think deeply about her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Trump, is fighting the re-election of G&P State candidate Geoff Dell, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There have been discussions around him that he might be competing with Trump in the 2020 election.
It was the 36th meeting with its organizers at the Town Hall in Hollywood on Saturday evening after Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him about being a presidential candidate.
"The time has come for us to get rid of this broken government under the leadership of a woman," Warren said.
Man arrested for killing L.S. Sims
Baton Rouge, L.A. Police said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in connection with Friday's shooting of L.S.U. basketball player Wade Sims.
Deton Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, urging people to identify the footage.
The 20-year-old was shot dead on the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media "Weed Sims was shot in the head," 247Sports reported.
Wade was attacked by Simpson in order to save his friend.
Simpson has been arrested and admitted to being on the scene, has been found with a weapon, and has also confessed to shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, has played 10 games since the beginning and played a total of 32 matches last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton moves closer to world title with his teammate Sebastian Vettel's gifted victory
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday and said the Mercedes team's order would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas started well, almost ignoring Hamilton, holding his position on the first two left and inviting Vetel to attack his own team player.
Vettel left Hamilton behind the crowd and went into the pit himself, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver hit the next lap and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went ahead after a tense fight to see the Ferrari driver leave the inside empty with a double-moving risk of involuntary loss of opportunity.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday today and he was number seven after the first lap.
He then went on to play a lot of the race first, then overcame Kimi Raikkonen with a bad tire and finished fourth.
He bats on the 44th lap, but the rest of the eight laps could not move further, leaving Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had a great weekend and worked like a real gentleman.
"The team is doing a great job," Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday ridiculed Senator Diane Finstein for not leaking a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing her of sexual assault on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the issue, but instead said what was happening in the Senate was showing people's "subtle and ugly and false" mentality.
"This is one thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the past few weeks, you'll see anger, when you see humble, ugly and lying people," he said.
"When they see the information leaked, they will say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
Oh, I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, what did you catch?
"Remember when you said, 'Oh, oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I didn't catch it."
Hey, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he said.
The letter was sent to Ford Finstein in July with a description of the charges against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September - but Finstein refused to leak it from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak anything," Finstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret."
But he didn't say anything to the president, he opened his mouth on Saturday night's rally: "I tell you what happened, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a worse body language."
Speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They want to regain power at any cost.
Look at the low mindset, look at the nastiness, don't let anyone hurt them, don't let anyone step in to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
He scored two goals for the Giant against Patrick Dyer.
Dundee Stars assured the Belfast Giants of a loss in Friday's Elite League game, with a 5-3 win over Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were quick to score two goals for Patrick Dyer and Francis Bevilla.
Mike Salivan and Jordan Cony returned to equalise for the home team and the Giants went on to score a goal.
For Dandi, Francois Bouchard equalized and then Lukas Landwald Nielsen scored two goals.
This is Adam Kieff's third rate in the Elite League, who came back from behind in Belfast on Friday night and lost to Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have met four times this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dior's first goal came in the fourth minute of the game at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFall, who doubled Bevilla's lead with the help of David Rutherford four more minutes later.
With the start of the game, Salivan brought the hosts back into the game in 13:10 minutes and later in 15:16 with the help of Matt Markert to equalise the team.
At the end of the first half, Dyer scored his second goal to make sure the Giants were ahead.
The hosts returned to the game and Bouchard scored a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Connie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and finally ensured the win by holding the lead.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play the next match against Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
Air traffic controllers have saved hundreds of lives aboard the plane in exchange for their lives.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been awarded the hero status after he died while helping the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing on the island of Sulawesi on Friday in a tsunami triggered by a major earthquake.
The area is repeatedly shaken by strong convergence tremors and people are trapped in the debris in the pool.
But despite all the co-workers fleeing in fear of their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Palu Mutiyara did not flee the Sis Al Zufri airport's horrificly dilapidated control tower.
He confirmed that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
He then jumped down in fear of falling off the control tower.
He later died in hospital.
A spokeswoman for Indonesian Air Navigation, Johannes Cright, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Palu this morning.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could drop to thousands, the disaster response agency said, adding that contacts in the cities of Dongla, Sigi and Butung have been limited.
"The death toll is believed to be on the rise, as many bodies remain trapped under debris that have not yet been reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Puryo Nugroho said.
A six-metre-high wave has destroyed the bridge, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Relief and relief are being provided by military and commercial aircraft.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The bodies are coming to the ambulance every minute. “The bodies are coming to the ambulance every minute.
There is no clear water.
Small markets have been plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfund, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly taking help to the survivors, but we don't know what we'll see there."
It's already sad, but the situation could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Sunday told the country's military: "I request you to work day and night on rescue operations.
Are you ready?" CNN's report.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: One missing in Laguna plane crash, says Air New Guinea
After a plane crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, they had earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane, and now they are reporting that one is missing.
Air New Guinea said in a report on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was not found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find out.
The airline immediately declined to provide details such as the passenger's age and nationality.
The plane helped rescue some local boat passengers and crew after it crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the water before reaching the runway.
A number of witnesses believed the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane went down very low.
"It's a good thing," Jens said.
Jens said that he and others reached the emergency door of the sinking plane after crossing the waist water.
He said the pilots were screaming in fear and had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the crew of a nearby jetty Sarai also helped with the rescue, bringing the plane to shore by a boat full of air before it sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died on PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but there have been no accidents at Air New Guinea.
Investigators have been able to trace the woman who was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday remanded the case to a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014 in Mississippi.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert on intelligence analysis.
She describes in front of the jury how the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Teles, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, created the nightlife of her death using cellphone records.
Rowlatt said he recovered information from a number of cellphones indicating that Teles and Chambers were together on the evening of the death, which was against the previous telescope, according to Clarion Laser's report.
According to the information, he was with his cellphone chambers at the time, although he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that night.
When prosecutors asked if Teles was telling the truth that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that "it was a lie because his truck was in Nashville that night."
Another inconsistency is that Teles said he knew him two weeks before Chambers died.
The phone records show that they have known each other for a week.
Rowlatt said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted text, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He saved my life," Hale said.
The final arguments in the case will be held on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to court the next day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge this trend's negative thinking by sending a positive message in the music.
Bristol's The High Bride, alleges that Hip Hop has deviated from its political message and the core of addressing social problems.
They want to go back to their original stream and make Conscious Hip Hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugitives and Common have recently seen a revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Another black man?!
New York Nanny has filed a lawsuit against a couple for dismissal after a "discriminatory" test.
A New York-based nanny is suing a related couple for discriminatory eviction after receiving misleading texts from a mother calling her "another black."
The couple has denied allegations of racial discrimination and has sought a trial for "jumbo."
Linsey Plasco-Falxman, the mother of two, expressed frustration after arriving on her first day of work in 2016 after learning that Giselle Morris, the new caretaker of the baby, was a black man.
"Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
Later, when he misunderstood, "disgusted" Plasco-Falxman fired Miss Morris. He said that his former nanny, who was an African-American, had expected a Filipino to act badly, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was given a one-day mine and then called Uber and sent home.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation in the case of eviction and seeking compensation as $350 a day for six months, although he was initially hired as a homemaker without a deal.
“I want to show them that, look, that can’t be done,” he told the post on Friday, adding that he added, “I know it’s discriminatory.”
The couple opposed the claim that they were racist, saying that it was a reasonable act to expel Morris for fear that he could not be trusted after he was charged.
He didn't say what his wife said.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist couples," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've abused, even if it's wrong?"
your child's?
Tell me."
Talking about the allegations, Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You want to fight someone like that?"
"It's not a good investment," said the banker.
In the wake of the ongoing legal proceedings, the public court has strongly condemned the couple's behaviour and reasoning on social media.
Paddington Publishing fears that readers may not be able to relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to say what the mind of the first reader will think before publication.
It's amazing to see the success of Patterson.
To his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before getting inspiration from the little toy bear to write children’s books, he said he would be optimistic about his rejection of the work. He also said that he had a “sweet” 60th anniversary of the book’s publication after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not a brazen man," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was as if your own child had achieved some success: you are proud of him, even though you have no role in it.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington.
Although it is the product of his own creation and imagination, he always credits Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her way to death and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad used to call regularly and say that it's very bad, and she probably won't survive," said Mrs. Adnan-Laperoz.
"Then I got Ned's phone and found out that he would be dead in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And that's what I do.
I said, "I love you, darling.
I'll get back to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart at bay were gradually stopping working in her body and getting out of her body.
He died a short time ago, and then it all stopped.
I had no choice but to wait.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Edenan-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - she was indifferent to this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
I lowered my head, my eyes watering.
It's impossible to describe it, but I was just sitting on the plane equating Ned's unfair pain.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
The woman posted a suicide note on the bridge.
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to suicide, work to stop the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries post cards with inspirational messages on the Welsh Bridge and place phone numbers where people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm doing," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef and possessed a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone used to say that his smile brightened the house."
However, before he died, he gave up work because he was "really in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was found dead.
Miss Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this effort will be intertwined.”
Mrs. Davis made the card: "To let everyone know that there are people you can talk to, she can be a friend."
Don't sit still and talk.
Ms Humphries, who has been Miss Davis' girlfriend for many years, has lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, just after her mother's death.
"He never said he was depressed or anything," she said.
"I noticed some changes in his use two days before Christmas.
"She had a very bad situation on Christmas Day - she didn't even look at them when the kids were opening their gifts."
He said his death was a huge emotional blow to him, but he had to overcome it: "It created a huge void in the family.
You've dismantled us.
But we have to fight on the way."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the wake of the FBI investigation
“I thought, if we could give something of what he wanted – since the time of the investigation is limited, the scope is limited – we could probably bring some unity,” Mr Fleck said Saturday. He added that he feared, the committee might “fall into disrepair” in the wake of this partisan stalemate.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They are related to time.
There are only five weeks left in the November 6 midterm elections - if, as expected, Republicans get a bad result, their efforts to get the people they like in the country's highest court will be too weak.
George W. Bush is calling senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him Mr. Bush met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the report is submitted?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and make it clear to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deportees "decreased" under Kim
The number of North Korean dissidents has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-Seg, quoting information from the South Korean Ministry of Consolidation, said the number of dissidents was 1,127 last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China were the main reason for the smuggling of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment on the matter.
A large number of North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them have fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is much easier than crossing the highly protected asymmetrical zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed fairly to work towards building a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
“If the United States has no confidence in our national security, we will have no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation we will not first unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteria-obsessed". She said she was ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has described the Supreme Court as "hysteria-obsessed" Naomi Brett Kavanaugh and said she was naturally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony: "I couldn't have imagined that a woman would have been called hysteria-obsessed if she had ever done such a thing."
Kavanaugh strongly denies the allegation that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blazey when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, screaming and breathing while talking about his family and high school life.
He categorically condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "stupid and insensitive character" organized by the Liberals, alleging that this was done in the wake of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Cavanoff's testimony proves he is not qualified for the Supreme Court because it proves he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself from the statement he made and the way he opposed Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked whether he would impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi expressed his displeasure.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only not qualified for the Supreme Court, but also unfit for the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of DC's Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act, or Roe v. Wade, because he was a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be allowed that a hysteria-obsessed, biased person will go to court and tell us 'isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger is coming out, and he can't keep crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
She added, “A woman executive in me has helped me a lot, who would say she would cry when she was angry too. But she chose the approach that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, “You might think I’m sad, because I’m crying.”
I'm really angry."
Then he continued.
I thought it was awesome."
Tears act partly as an expression of anger, because they are mainly misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job, in a male-head office, where I once saw myself crying in incredible anger, was an elderly woman holding my scarf - a terrible manager I'd always feared - who dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy to see you."
Patrick Schröder, then Democratic Congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called Monkey Business abroad and ran out of competition for dirty work, deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder thought that there was no reason for him not to be a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he said, smiling after 30 years.
"There are already seven other candidates in the fray, and none of the other candidates wanted to.
One called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was initially delayed, he was lagging behind in fundraising and so he vowed not to run the race without collecting $2 million.
It was a war of loss.
He found that a supportive man was being paid only $250 if he was given $1,000.
"Do they think I'll get out of value?" He said in surprise.
When he announced that he would not be running a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude to his supporters, making it difficult to raise money, leaving the electorate out of representation, and becoming sick of anger about gender inequality.
"You might have thought I had a neurological disorder," Ms Schröder recalls the media's procrastination.
"You could have guessed that I'm a business owner.
I wonder where they're going to bury me.
"She was crying?"""
How the U.S.-China trade war could lead to Beijing
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade war was noisy, and while the final phase of the war, Beijing could benefit in the long run from the conflict between the two countries, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year warned of a first increase in tariffs on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant breakthrough has been this week, when almost half of the total imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), new tariffs were placed.
Beijing has retaliated like every time - recently it has increased tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods by five to ten percent.
China has decided to fight with an eye on the world's second-largest economy and there is no chance of it coming down soon.
It would be extremely humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly bow his head to the United States.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play the toss correctly, the US trade war could help China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"Any quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation of economic collapse in both countries, much more dangerous than the perception of the knowledgeable world," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the think tank, the Center for New American Security, which deals with Asia.
Syria is “ready” to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says the country is ready to voluntarily return refugees, and has called for the seven-year war-torn country to be rebuilt.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"The situation today is stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now favorable for the voluntary return of people forced to leave the country due to the disruption of daily life and livelihood due to terrorism and the surrounding economic conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mawlam said the Syrian government welcomed all assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he also stressed that no conditional assistance will be accepted or assistance will be taken from the country supporting the rebels.
Winner of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Rider Cup by defeating Team USA at Le Golf National in France with a final score of 16.5-10.5 outside of Paris.
The U.S. lost to Europe six times in a row and have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Beyonce, Team Europe reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States and regain the title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who didn't play well in most of the tournament, hit his T-shot in the 16th hole of Par-3, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been one of only 1 in 4 scoring above 5-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth, Europe's lowest-ranked player, was beaten 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbjorn Olsen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top-ranked player, lost to England's Ian Polter in 2 and 1, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
Experienced in the eight-time Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio García has the most wins in Europe with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you for believing in me and trusting me.
I'm glad I got the cup back.
It's the team's success, I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said.
He handed the responsibility to his country's John Ram, who lost to American legend Tiger Woods in the 2nd and 1st singles on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have lost Tiger Woods, grown up to see him," said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France, setting a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is incompatible statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has only won 14 major titles after top-ranked Jack Nicklaus.
Apart from high-quality performance performers Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, the team has stumbled throughout the weekend in the USA.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they've fought.
This morning we had a little bit of pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good manager.
All 12 of his players played very well.
"We will go around, I will work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee of America and move forward.
I love them and am proud to be their leader.
You have to respect them.
We didn't get in the game."
Red Stream Update: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A new report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission has shown a general decline in red current concentrations in the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, the Bloom situation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier has been observed - a sign of a decline in density.
Bloom of the Red River stretches about 130 miles along the coastline from North Pineless to South Lee County.
The patch can be seen about 10 miles from the shores of Hillsborough County, but it's less noticeable than last week.
There is also a red flag in Pasco County.
Last week in Pineless County with moderate density on the shores and away from the shores, far from the coasts of Hillsborough County with low to high density in Manatee County, high density on and away the coasts of Sarasota County, medium density in Charlotte County, low density in Lee County and far to the shores of Boshi County.
Breathing problems are still being reported from Pineless, Manatee and Sarasota, Lee and Collier County.
There have been no reports of respiratory problems in Northwest Florida for the past week.
