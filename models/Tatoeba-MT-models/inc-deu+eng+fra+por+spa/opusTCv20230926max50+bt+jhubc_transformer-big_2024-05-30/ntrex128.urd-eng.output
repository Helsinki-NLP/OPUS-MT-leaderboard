Welsh AMs worried about ‘looking like fools’
A suggestion in some AMs that their address should be converted into MWPs (Welsh Parliamentarian) is found to be alarming.
This concern arises from the fact that the name of the Assembly was changed to Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried that this may lead to their ridicule.
A Labour AM said their group is concerned that his voice is matched with that of Twp and Pwp.
For the reader out of Wales: twp in Welsh means crazy and pwp means dog.
A Plaid AM said their group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group has an "open mind" about the name change, however said there is a short-lived verbal jump between the MWP and the crazy.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is similar to the English letter u of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a legal draft to introduce the name change, said: Any speech that is to be addressed to the members of the Assembly is undoubtedly the final decision to be made by the members themselves.
The Welsh government's Act of 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, showing wide support for what the Assembly calls the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of AM's speech, the Commission has supported members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP has received the most support in public consultation.
AMs seem to be suggesting alternative options, however reaching a consensus for presiding officer Allan Jones could be a pain-stricken headache, which is expected to be submitted to the legal draft about the changes within weeks.
Legislation on reforms also includes other changes regarding the way the assembly works, including rules regarding the inefficiency of AMs and the design of the committee system.
During the debate on the legislation, the AMs will give a final vote on what address they should be called for.
The people of Macedonia will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of East Macedonia."
Public opinion polls have been set up to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has named one of its provinces Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor expresses a claim over its own letter, and that it repeatedly objected to its membership efforts in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to the vote on the name change, has said he would ignore it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaif, have argued that the name change is only the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells went off while churches in Harlem were in trouble.
"Historically, whenever I spoke to the old people, they would say, 'There was a church in every corner once more.'
Neither of them today.
He said it was possible to get rid of the bugs.
People's lives have changed in different ways.
Bars are no longer places where people used to go regularly.
As far as churches are concerned, they are concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expected, and they will stand where they went.
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium apartment buildings that would be filled with people who would not support the remaining places of worship in the area.
He said that the overwhelming majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings would be white and they would play a role in the early closure of those churches because it is very unlikely that those who move to these condominiums will become members of those churches.
The two churches were built by white groups before Harlem became a black metropolis and became a metropolitan community in 1870 after a decade of St. Martin.
The original white-fashioned Methodist group migrated in the 1930s;
A black group of people who worshiped nearby called the building by its name.
A black group led by Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martin, and they led a boycott against the Progeny vendors on Harlem's Central Business Road 125th Street for resisting the blacks recruiting and developing.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson's church circles planned to rebuild it, they hired Carlyleon (the bellkeepers).
Father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, called Carleon "the bells of the poor" with the scandal.
In July, an expert playing Carillon told him something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an unchanging historical treasure."
Tiffany, an expert at the University of Michigan, mentioned that it was the first carillon to be played by a black musician, Devonsio A. Lind, who moved to the large carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mary Weeder said that St. Martin did not change it.
What has been going on in St. Martin for the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by the general leaders of the church and others by the priest.
In July, the Parish's governing body, Vestry, expressed concerns in writing to the priest's association that the associated architects and contractors who have been sent by the association would put the upfront costs on Vestry, even though Vestry was not involved in recruiting them.
Some people have complained about the lack of transparency.
A 13-year-old boy has been injured by sharks in California.
Government officials said on Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving in California to catch a dinghy fish.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Innsbruck.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy running for help.
Hamel said that at first he thought he was happy to go fishing, but then he realized that he was driving because something had bite me.
I've got something cut off.
Hamel said that when he went to the boy, he saw that his entire hunley bone had been opened.
Hamel said he told everyone to get out of the water and said there was a shark fish in the water.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is stated to be critical.
The attacker's shark was not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles said during a media briefing that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
He added that the boy had sustained injuries in the upper body.
Officials have blocked access to the Swamy Beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad for investigation and security purposes.
Gilles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
The UK's entry into the gold market
Sainsbury's is offering products of bots, superdrugs and debian hams with racks in the style of a department store with Splashshot assistant staff.
The UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion make-up beauty market, which is still developing while fashion and home decor items sales are declining, will be tested in 11 stores across the country as part of a significant arrival, and if proven successful, more stores will be added next year.
The investment is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and home decor items.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of its make-up jewelry offerings by adding brands such as Revolon, Aki, Tozerman and Dr. Piapa for the first time.
The current offerings of L'Oréal, Maye Blanche and Britsbees will also be given more space by providing specific locations for the brand, as is the case in bots' stores.
Supermarket is also resuming its boutique make-up series so that most products are customizable to vegetarians - something that young buyers are increasingly demanding.
Additionally, the fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will also try discounts at two Szenbury stores, the first of which opened last week in South London's Crodon area, while the second store will open later this year in the Sally Oaks area of Birmingham.
A change in the trend towards online shopping and buying small quantities of daily food from local convenience stores means that supermarkets will have to do more to attract people.
Sensbury's chief executive Mike Cope said his outlets would look more like department stores, while Supermarket China is competing with discounted Aldi and Leeds with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's also has hundreds of Argos outlets in its stores and has introduced a number of hepatitis since it bought both of China two years ago, which it says has increased its gross sales.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors had failed.
Sensbury tried a joint effort with Bots in the 2000s, but the partnership ended after a controversy over how to split income from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes at a time when Sainsbury's sold its 281-storey pharmacy business to Lloyd's Pharmacy China owner Salisbury for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million 30 years ago.
It said Lloyds will play a role in the project by offering luxurious brands of skin care in four stores, including La Roche Pose and Vichy products.
Paul Mills Hooks, commercial director of Sensbury, said: "We have changed the shape and feel of our make-up racks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have specifically invested in trained staff who will be able to offer immediate advice.
Our range of brands have been designed to meet every need and the absorbing looking environment and comfort places mean that we have now become an exciting place to offer a make jewelry product that challenges the old style of shopping.
"Peter Jones" after Holly Wooley's 11-million-pound deal exited
"Dragons Dunn's star Peter Jones is ""very excited"" after TV presenter Holly Wooley pulled out of his <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with the life-style brand business."
There's no time for brand trolleys of costumes and accessories to wear in their home with Wolves.
The couple's business is compared with GoPro's GoPro brand.
Daisy Morning's 37-year-old preorderer announced his departure from the deal on Instagram.
Holly Wooby left her angry in the last minute by saying goodbye to Dragon Dunn's star Peter Jones' lucrative life-style brand business.
Sources said that Jones was "disappointed" when the Golden Girl of TV confessed during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe area of Burkina Faso on Tuesday that his new deals worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant he didn't have enough time to wear the brand's home and wear the brand's uniform.
Their business was compared to Goneth Paltrow's Gop brand, and it was assumed that Wolby's wealth would double to about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As the 37-year-old announced his departure from Trolley on Instagram, Jones immediately departed from the UK to one of his vacation homes on board.
A source said: "Trolley has been Holly's top priority to a great extent.
This is their long-term future in the next two decades.
Everyone was surprised by his decision to leave.
No one knew what was going to happen next, but it was close to the end of the day.
Marlowe Headquarters has a warehouse full of equipment that is ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of Daz Morning's Presence, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could result in the firm losing millions of pounds due to heavy investments in products ranging from knives and candles to clothing and home apparel, and the possibility of further delays in its launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara for ten years.
Woloby founded the Trolley in 2016 with Cape, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple had a holiday together and owns 40% of Jones Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and host Ant McCartney's place in I'm A Celebrity on ITV's show.
A source close to Jones said last night that he would not comment on his business affairs.
We had a great conversation and then we fell in love.
He criticised the news media for making comments that some consider "non-presidential" and mocked being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so much money?
Trump said in his “news anchor” ridiculous voice.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He recalled that Kim was interested in a second meeting with him, which Trump described as an important step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
Negotiations on the use of firearms have been stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "responsible response" from the United States to its initial actions.
Instead, he said the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump was more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing well with North Korea.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people become victims.
Now our relationship is strong.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and bringing back the remnants of U.S. troops home.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space, you're seeing about 200 people standing in front of you," Trump said.
Tsunami in Indonesia, earthquake destroys island, kills hundreds of people
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign foreign government organizations were told they were not needed.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national disaster was not declared, which is the main source of international aid.
Ms Sombong said that in many cases, unfortunately, she was absolutely clear that she would not ask for international aid, which is a bit too convincing.
While Save the Children is forming a team to head to Palo, he is still not sure if his crew will be allowed to work on the spot.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Response Agency (NDRA) said Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies were allowed to participate in the rescue efforts.
Despite the constant face of earthquakes, the country is not at all ready to deal with natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely seen on the coast.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palau is likely to be responsible for the loss of lives.
Even in the best times, it is advisable to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
The hospital in Lombok is on its way to Palo Alto, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of a natural disaster.
President Joko Widodo has been at the forefront of his election campaign to improve Indonesia's infrastructure, and has spent money on roads and railways.
But Jokowi's administration is facing shortages of funds, while next year's elections will be held.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from growing religious tensions in Indonesia, while some members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Clashes between the Isaias and the Muslims, in which knives, bows, arrows and other weapons were used, killed more than 1,000 people and displaced several thousands.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Struge scores equal to Chelsea's
At Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a score in the 89th.
Sturge received a pass from Hurden Shakir about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal when their team was behind zero in comparison to one.
He took the ball first to the left and then shot towards the far post.
The ball reached the top right corner of the net floating above the box.
The ball finally fell on the Kappa arzbalaga, jumping into the net.
Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com that I was trying to get into that position, that reaching the ball and shaking like players always play as far ahead as possible, so I tried to make the way for myself.
When I saw the fork coming, I just touched the ball once and shot without thinking too much.
Chelsea got a 0-1 lead in the half-time with a score by Bulgarian star Edin Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker slammed Gandalf near the midfield and returned to Matteo Kuchak with a fall of the heel after a run in Liverpool's half.
Kouchak immediately grabbed the ball in the midfield.
He then brought the ball back to the box with Hazard in a beautiful way.
Hazard hit the defense, throwing the ball from the top of Liverpool's Alison Baker to the net from the next post.
In the group stage of the Champions League, Liverpool will face Naples at the stadium in San Paulo, Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will take on Widoton in UEFA Europa on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster response agency said on Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had reached 832.
The agency's spokesman, Sotopo Provo Noguero, told a news conference that many people were trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed due to a 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday.
The city of Palo Alto, with a population of over 380,000, is surrounded by debris.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the murder of a woman.
An investigation into the death of a woman was launched this morning in the Burkina Faso area.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street from Gracen Music and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area to inform the police if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective inspector Byron O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in the early stages, but I appeal to those who were around John Street in Brokenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, if they have captured some dashcam footage, please contact us as it may contain the same information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local in Burkina Faso and the body was found inside a prostate.
This afternoon friends who think the woman knows came to the place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, but police say they are in the process of informing the woman's close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grisson Music has just tried to get into his flat but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was stunned when he found out about the incident.
Residents are now being told that it may take several hours when they are allowed to go back inside.
A police spokesman said the entire area was being evacuated.
A woman came to the scene of the crash.
He said, “This is terrible.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the lathe while one car was parked outside.
A number of officers were inspecting the blocks of empty flats inside the lace.
Anyone with information is being asked to DM <0x40>MerPollCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 without being named by referring to the 247 log of September 30.
Cromwell's statue outside Parliament has become the latest monument to the controversy over 'reconstructing history'
His deportation would be the destruction of the Taliban's style of so much of England's cultural and religious art that would be natural justice for his obsessive and harsh Christian followers.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crooks' proposal "inappropriate" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inconceivable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order, nor did he do, the image of England's civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong chrome will be made a scapegoat for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hammoth Thorney Croat's excellent representation of the Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century, and part of the literary narrative of a personality that many believe is to be appreciated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sundance Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, consider Cromwell a man who defends Parliament against external pressures that were undoubtedly a monarchy for them.
Whether this is an accurate representation has been the subject of ongoing historical debate.
One thing that is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict laid the foundation for the development of our country's well-being, and the chromewell is the individual identifiable personality that represents a part of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are valuable and memorable.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China and killed him.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by his family name "Yuan", was found in a market in the Liupashui area of the province of Guizhou.
A farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xinjiang, China's Kanghai province.
According to reports, he had come with his cousin to sell 15 pigs in the market on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Greece.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and he found the door of the pig's closet open.
He saw that there was a large male pig in the fence with blood on his face.
According to the report, the forensic examination has confirmed that a 550-pound pig crushed the farmer to death.
Guiang Evening News quoted her cousin "U" as saying that her cousin's legs were bloodied and crushed.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The one who killed him was not the pig Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in the locker so as not to attack others while police were gathering evidence from the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating the compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, incidents of attacks on humans by pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig hit a Welsh farmer with a tractor, but his wife later drove him away.
When a pig Oregon farmer was bitten by a mantoba in 2012, a mantoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They're just drinking.
They move, they're very curious... they don't hurt you.
You just have to value them.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring heavy rains in the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes over the shallow waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will cause flooding throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5 a.m. Eastern Time, Rosa had a wind speed of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles southwest of Penta Ogdenia, Mexico.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a truffle is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards toward the west coast of the United States, while Rosa is moving towards a baja California plateau on Monday as a windstorm that will push warm moisture northwards towards the southwestern United States.
Rainfall is expected to fall by 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
In the coming days, heavy rainfall is expected in the south-western regions.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding relays, debris eruptions and potentially soil erosion in the desert.
Deep-fried moisture will take the rainfall rate to 2 to 3 inches per hour at some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arkansas.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 4 inches in some parts of Southwest, especially in most of Astana.
Flood relays are likely due to rapidly changing conditions from the nature of the rainy season and dispersion.
Due to the risk of heavy rain, it would be very unwise to advise walking in the desert.
Heavy rains can turn waterways into angry rivers, and thunderstorms with thunderstorms will cause strong winds and surrounding clouds.
The rising turf will bring locally heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
In total, more than half an inch of rain is possible, which can produce fruit from soil erosion on roads and roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some scattered hare rains will begin to move towards Arusha on the 6th Sunday evening and early Monday morning, and the rain will spread farther on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will continue into Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations can be seen throughout the United States, while the north pole cools, but the logical hare remains quite hot.
This results in dramatic changes in temperature over a short period of time.
The dramatic temperature difference in Central America on Sunday is a great example of this.
There will be a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Amaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and the Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will again increase and expand.
Most parts of central and eastern America are likely to get warmer by October and temperatures are likely to reach 80 degrees Celsius in some parts of the north-east from the southern plains.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a higher probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States by the first few days of October.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brittany.
Nominated Supreme Court judge Brett Kaneva and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford,'s testimony on Tuesday was seen by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political tensions continue, and the unpredictable last-minute situation that took place on Friday under which Arkansas Senator Jeff Flake created an agreement to investigate allegations by the FBI for a week disrupted its regular programs.
Ms. Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that during a high school party, Keneva caught hold of her and tried to take off her clothes.
During the emotional testimony, Kenya said she was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing as reported by Nelson on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data were not available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, who showed it.
And Nelson usually has trouble measuring people who are seen in offices.
In view of this point of view, its audience size was the same as a Play of Football match or an Academy Award.
Nielsen told Fox News Channel, whose participants strongly supported the appointment of Kenya, was ahead of all networks during the entire day's hearing with an average audience of 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nelson reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest continued after the hearing.
Flynn was the main protagonist in the play on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement to vote in favor of Kenya, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him on Friday morning in a situation that protesters were running on him as he tried to climb an elevator to hear a court committee.
Live on CNN was shown that he kept his eyes down for several minutes when he was being severely criticized.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
Do you think he is telling the truth?
He said, "You have a lot of women.
Fleck said his office has issued a statement and added that he has much more to say at the committee's hearing before the elevator is closed.
Cable and broadcast networks were all broadcasting the event live, when the judicial committee had to vote to send Kenya's nomination to the full Senate for voting.
However, Flake said he would do so only with an understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against Kenya next week, which minority Democrats have been pushing.
Flake was convinced after a conversation with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Cons and later several other senators, Fleck made his decision.
Flake's election was important, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kenya without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kenya.
British Prime Minister Meyer accuses critics of 'politicizing' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview to the Sunday Times newspaper accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “politicizing” the future of Britain and harming the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, reiterated his criticism of his checkered plan for Brexit and said the UK and the EU's proposal to collect tariffs was "totally far-fetched."
Shooting: Police arrest Diane Simpson in connection with the murder of an LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of murdering a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU, shooting at Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge police department said 20-year-old Dietrich Simpson was arrested and sent to jail for second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims were lost during the fighting.
Police found the source and said they had found Simpson's DNA on him.
After being interrogated by Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting at Wade in a lethal manner.
The lawyer has reported that his bail amount has been set at $350,000.
The Coroner's office of East Baton Rouge Parish released an initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet-prone injury to the head.
The department appreciated the support of the task force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police's Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for helping with the investigation for arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Allefa thanked the law enforcement agencies in the area for showing "fighting in providing justice."
Sam was 20 years old.
He grew up in a six-foot six-foot baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He earned an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "happy" and "in shock" with Wade's death.
Wyatt said that's something you've been thinking about all along.
Rain showers in Mexico City from a fire.
Popocatepetl firefighter Lava has reached the southern palaces of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the blaze as it began rapidly lava advances and recorded 183 gas and soil emissions over the course of 24 hours.
The center is monitoring a number of shocks and forward sounds in it.
Photos on social media show a layer of clay on the glasses of cars in Mexico City, such as Zochimilco.
Geologists have observed an increase in volcanic activity following a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, located 45 miles (72 km) from the capital.
"Don Guo" fireworks have been in operation since 1994.
Police clash with separatists ahead of Independence Day
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and police on Saturday, and thousands of people from both sides took part in the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of separatists, who were wearing masks, threw eggs and powder paint on the police, causing a deep cloud of dust in the streets where tourists usually rush.
Later, clashes broke out between the protesters and police charged with sticks to stop the fighting.
For several hours, supporters of the liberation movement shouted "no illusions, no excuses," while unionist protesters shouted "Spain alive."
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries.
The October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid, and the separatist Catalans, a year after celebrating it, continues to have tensions in the region with a spirit of independence.
The voters voted in favor of independence with the dominant majority, if the turnout was low and the opposition of the separatists boycotted most of the vote.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop polling at polling stations in the region during violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups woke up on Friday night to stop a demonstration in favour of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but it was forced to take a different path.
A 68-year-old electrician, Narciss Trimes, who was part of a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
Last year we had some good times.
I saw my parents crying out for joy when they took part in the poll, but now we are stuck.
Despite a significant victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties are facing difficulties in maintaining the movement this year as many of their famous leaders are exiled at their will or detained for organising a referendum and later declaring independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, who was recording protests in support of police over the phone, said politicians on both sides had sparked a controversy.
He said that the tension was rising.
Arroyo Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
He said standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to lower democratic values and condemn the abuses of the Spanish government.
London Dairy: Three people arrested for robbing a car at home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested in London's Derry for hitting a car several times.
The incident took place at Ballard Crescent at around 19:30 UK standard time on Thursday.
The detective inspector Bob Blimings said the gate and the building were damaged.
There was also a car accident at some point.
Meng Meng's goal to win 0-1 over Livingston Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston won.
Progressive Livingstone surprised the Rangers with the win and caused Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's streak varied, while Gary Holt's team equalled with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team is without any wins in the Premiership this season, and will face Hurts next Sunday, which he is eight points behind.
Earlier, the Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has taken their victories in the Davis Cup to six games, and head coach Holt has not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
There's less competition for the Lions fans.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, while his knuckles made the Rangers suffer from all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson made a break-through, but could barely take his effort to the front of the goal, then Alan Lithgro found himself more broadly than before he faced the R-over header from this Craig Hollitt's goal.
The host team was satisfied with allowing Rangers to play with them, knowing they could put visitors in trouble in the set-pieces.
And that's how a very important shot came into existence.
The Rangers provided a free kick, and Livingston started when Declan and Gallagher faced the mixed manga, scoring from the middle of the box.
To this stage, Rangers' position was dominated by, but they found that the host team's defense is inconsequential and goalkeeper Liam Kelly is permanently qualified.
The same pattern continued in the second half, if only Alfredo Morlos got a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was missed by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgrow took a shot away from another set of Livingston.
Livingston's box continued to cross with continuity and continued to be clear with continuity, while only two claims to the panel were made - when Halkitt faced alternative Glenn Middleton and for a handball - which was rejected.
‘Extraordinary’ by Livingston – Analysis
Tony Macaroni Irena at BBC Scotland's Alas der Lamont
An extraordinary performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, he was great, who consistently exceeded expectations on this high-altitude journey.
Their playing style and team members have changed little since returning to their peak flight, but the real reward goes to Holt, who has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkitt remained impressive, offering a very beautifully managed defense while Manga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Varal on five throughout the game.
However, he was not enthusiastic about the Rangers.
As good as they've been living under Gerard's leadership, they can't meet these standards.
They didn't have control over the ball and could only start once against the hosts - and that's a threat bell for the Rangers while they're in the middle of the score table.
Welcome to the Jungle for Oregon.
On Saturday (September 29) there was a smile and a blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at reshaping relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's involvement in the EU.
The Uruguayans later went to Cologne to inaugurate a great new mosque.
The city has the largest number of tourists after Turkey.
Police cited security concerns to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but several supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Urdu protesters - mostly Kurds - also gathered and condemned the German government for its policies and welcoming them into the country.
These demonstrations reflect the fact that some German-Turkish Urdus are regarded as heroes, while others consider them an absolute al-Anan ruler.
Deptford Road accident: A cyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The incident occurred at the junction of Bestwood Street and Alvin Street on a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped the car and the paramedics provided medical assistance, but he died on the spot.
The incident took place a month after the shooting on Children's Street, about a mile away, in which another cyclist was killed.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted and people have been advised not to turn around in the area.
Long Larton Prison: Six people were injured in the riots
Six men were injured in a high-security prison, the Prison Office said.
The unrest occurred at HMP Long Larton in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 09:30 British time.
Expert "Tornado" personnel have been called in to control the chaos in which eight prisoners are involved.
The injured were treated for minor injuries on the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Larton.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and their imprisonment will be increased.
HMP Long Larton has more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the jail governor was injured in an attack by a prisoner who was treated in a hospital.
In October last year, police were called in to deal with a severe storm, in which crew members were attacked with police balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding rails in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (areas affected by drought may benefit)
It is rare to influence the aspiration of a Hurricane, but it is likely to happen as early as next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa will shift to the south-west of the desert and present a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood rallies warnings for southern and eastern Nevada, east California and Ottawa, including Phoenix, Flag Staff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday after arriving with rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten cyclones (several times) since 1950 have maintained Hurricane or Hurricane status within 200 miles of Phoenix!"
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane that lived within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, while the Aka-dika places in the Mogollon region of Arkansas are likely to receive up to 6 inches of rain.
Other parts of the south-west including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while a total of 4 inches of rain is likely to fall in the Ekadka place.
Areas that are out of danger of flooding, the rain brought by Rosa will prove to be a mercy as the region is prone to drought.
Although the risk of flooding is a serious concern, some rain is likely to be useful as the southwestern region suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of the Arkansas region is in the second-highest category of drought.
First, the route to Rosa will pass through the Baja California surface of Mexico.
Rosa, which was maintaining a hurricane force with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of the Mexican region of Pentagonia and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold waters in the Pacific and is therefore reducing its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico by Hurricane Harvey on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora and is also likely to be around 10 inches.
Rosa will then make its way to the east over Mexico as a Hurricane and arrive at the border of Aspena as a Hurricane on Tuesday morning.
The National Hurricane Center said the major threat from Rosa and its remnants would be extremely heavy rains over California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. desert.
Due to these rains, deadly flood relays in the deserts and soil erosion in the mountainous region can occur.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for allegedly attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The young child was found injured in the accelerator teres area of Midsummer Norton at about 04:00 British time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is stated to be "stable."
Ivan and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested from the Redstock area overnight.
Officials have appealed to people to come forward if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Donald Trump says Kenyans ‘can tolerate anger, anger’
Trump told a rally in West Virginia's Wheeling area that the vote for Judge Kenewa meant a vote to reject the Democratic Party's unfounded and embarrassing tricks.
Trump accused Kenya of having "tolerated" the Democratic Party's "community and anger" in its nomination process.
Kenya on Thursday testified in front of Congress and vehemently denied the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, accusing her of sexually harassing her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified about his guilt during the hearing.
The president claimed Saturday that “the Americans demonstrated the quality and courage of Kenyans on that day.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that a vote to confirm Judge Keneva would be a vote for the right of a lawmaker with the most competent legal personality of our times and an outstanding record of public service.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in mid-term elections, the president referred to Kenya's nomination as an indicator.
"One of the most important elections of our lives is just five weeks away.
I'm not taking part in it, but I'm actually taking part.
That's why I'm going everywhere in favor of great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "protest and obstruct."
A senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first major vote in the Senate on Kenya's nomination would be before Friday.
Earthquake in Indonesia kills hundreds of people, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Slavica and several spoke to the sky, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palo on Friday for a fair when waves up to six metres (18 ft) high hit the beach at sunset and dumped people and things on their way.
The tsunami was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Indonesia's natural disaster management agency BNPB spokeswoman Sotopo Provo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta that when the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy on the coast.
The Tsunami destroyed cars, trees, houses and everything on the ground, Nagroho said, adding that the Tsunami waves passed through the sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survived.
About 16,700 people have been moved to relief centers in Palo Alto.
Images released by the agency showed buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed, and a mosque submerged in water.
Earthquakes are also being felt in the coastal city this week.
The quake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Review and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the severe earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said that the city's geography, which is located on a long and narrow bay, may have increased the intensity of the tsunami.
Noguero called the damage "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said some bodies had been found in the debris of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
He said the 300-kilometre (190-mile) coastal area north of Palo that is called Dongala and is close to the epicenter of the earthquake could cause more deaths and damage.
Nogarhoo said the communication system was completely destroyed and there were no reports from Dongala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that there are more than 300,000 people living there and added that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected area.
He said it was a big deal, and it could get worse.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting about the tsunami in Palau, although officials said the waves came within the time the warnings were issued.
In non-professional footage shared on social media, a man standing on the top floor of a building is warning people about the coming of the tsunami in the downstairs street.
Within minutes, a wall of water collided with the beach and swept away buildings and cars with them.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages, disrupting the communications system around Palau and making it difficult for authorities to intervene in relief activities.
The army has started sending relief supplies to cargo ships from Jakarta and other cities, but the victims still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief activities and will remain closed until October for other flights.
President Joko Widodo will visit the relief centers in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
While World Vision staff have safely arrived in the city of Palo Alto, where its employees live in Tarpoline-based shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have gone through disaster scenes along the way.
He said many houses were destroyed on the road.
The situation is very bad.
Although the relief crews have begun the difficult task of moving equipment for relief operations, some have complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers are being prevented from traveling to Palo Alto.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, equipment, and crew from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a natural disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It's not yet.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Oliya Aryani, said it was still a province-level disaster.
Once the government says that it is a national disaster, we call for international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted.
After the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, when the second night in Palau, friends and relatives of the missing people were praying to Allah for their loved ones to be among the miraculous survivors of natural disasters.
A small child was rescued alive from the rubble on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman after two days of debris, while her mother's body was found near her.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Gundon Sabandono trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the others trapped in the Rua Hotel was Mr. Mandavi, who said his students were among them.
He said that as a senior in the paragliding sector, I had my own emotions.
Mr. Gundon explained how within hours of the news of the Rua Rua hotel's collapse spread in the paragliding community, he had sent WhatsApp messages to players from Palo who attended the coastal fair.
One of their messages found a brown mark instead of a blue mark.
This means that their messages have not been delivered.
Thieves stole $26,750 during an ATM refill in Louisville.
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brunswick worker while refilling an ATM in Newport on Friday morning.
Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release that the driver of the car was preparing to empty the ATM in the entertainment complex and put more money.
While he was busy with his work, a man "runs from behind the Bronx employee" and stole the bag that was kept for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to YES.
Reaper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I'm officially known as Kanye West."
The eighteen-year-old West's acronym has been around for some time, and he has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made ahead of his participation in the 'Saturday Night Live', where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He is replacing Ariana Grande in the show, who canceled her participation due to 'emotional reasons', the show's owner said.
In addition to being an acronym for their current professional name, West said earlier that the new word had religious significance for them.
I think ‘yes’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’. This is what West said while discussing his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us and it's us.
It originated from the canyon which means only one and now it has become Ye - which is a reflection of our goodness, our glory, our anxiety, and everything else.
The album is also a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the few famous rappers who have changed their names.
San Combs is known by various names as Puff Daddy, Paddy or Daddy, but this year it announced its preference for the names of Lo and Brother Lou.
West's former partner, JAY-Z, has also used names with and without hyphens and major characters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians, while the country is marching towards the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez vowed "never to use the military against the people of Mexico" in the Tlatlulco Plaza on Saturday.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in Plaza, killing at least 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help young people by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to crime groups.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come at a time when various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, although overall the U.S. has no formal AI strategy.
Last year, China announced its plan to become number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling AI research budgets would be a good start, while all other countries are far behind the United States and we look forward to the next big discovery in AI," Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that doubling funding would double the chances that the next major success in AI is achieved in the United States.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World System" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, <0x2B><0x2B>Face.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that honors America's highest-ranked Othello player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised the challenge of the previous U.S. government's technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project, the agency's robotic manufacturing, and asked when the next competition would be to identify next-generation technologies.
Lee said researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said that these are not China, but the corporates who are taking the teaching leaders.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
He said that PhD holders in AI should be offered a green card automatically.
China's state council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said China's National Natural Science Foundation funds educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies pay U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center aimed at engaging partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
And this year, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a forward called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
For months, the U.S. government has failed to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonian people took part in the referendum to change the country's name.
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum to name the country "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that will resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighboring country shows the claim over its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that the name change will harm the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether a turnout of at least 50 percent would be met to be authentic.
The question on the referendum's ballot was: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership by accepting a deal with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Rif, believe it is the cost of entry to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, a country that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Oliviera Georgeloska, 79, in Skopje, said: "I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to live with freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure lives for all of us."
Although not legally required, a number of parliamentarians have said they will accept the outcome of the referendum.
A two-thirds majority is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of corruption as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016.
Gusey Tanosky, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje, said: "I came here to vote for my children and for making my place in Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zuran Zaif, his wife Zurika and son Dschko are voting in a referendum to change the name of the country in the Macedonian city of Stromeka on September 30, 2018, paving the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Spokane, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadrakov was preparing a small stage for those boycotting the referendum and drawing chairs in front of the tents.
Kavadrakov said: "We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to rise above them and join them, not through the service door.
We are not a poor country, we are a poor country.
If they don't want to include us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaif said NATO's membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with the country's unemployment rate exceeding 20 percent.
Zaif said: "I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said, "Yes, the future is ours."
According to a survey conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - far less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Talma TV said 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said "yes."
The turnout must be above 50% in order for the referendum to be successful.
The failure of the referendum would be a severe blow to the pro-Western government's policy that took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses the entire Brighton defense to shoot
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling defeated Brighton defense in Manchester City's 0-2 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguirre showed his score in the 65th minute looking ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the move.
Before arriving in the open field, he overtook Brighton's three defenders.
Aguirre again found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He chipped one of the defenders and left several others behind at the head of the Brighton box.
Then he turned to the left.
The English forward gave the ball back to Aguirre with the first kick in the box, who used his right boot to mate Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and threw the ball to the right of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguirre had some problems with his foot.
"We played for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to get a shot at it.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues an early lead over the Premier League.
The shot came in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguirre got the ball in the area of Brighton.
He took a deep breath to the left of the labyrinth.
Sean gave the ball to Sterling on the next post with some jokes.
Sky Blues's forward hit a light fall and threw the ball into the net.
City will face Hoffnheim in the Champions League group play on Tuesday at 12:55 in Raheen-Nikar-Arena, Germany.
Sherlock wants to play with the Rockies.
After the Nationals' play-off exit, there was no major reason for another start.
But Scherzer, who has always been at the bottom of the competition, wants to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are repercussions of the play-offs for the Rockies, which dominates a game over the Los Angeles Daggers in the National League West.
The Rockies received at least one Wildcard with a 2-5 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get their first Division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we will be able to compete knowing that here in Denver with spectators and the other team will be playing at the highest level.
Why don't I compete with it?
The Nationals are yet to announce their starter for Sunday, but according to reports, they will give Scherzer a chance to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will take his 34th start, threw a bill pan session on Thursday and is expected to play as usual on Sunday.
The Washington-based Wright Henderson is at 7-18 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the Republican turnout in mid-term elections, the president referred to the situation with regard to his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kenyatta.
What we're doing is going to happen in November.
One of the most important elections of our time is five weeks away.
"It's a big thing -- I'm not standing in it but I'm actually a part of it and that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this terrifying, terrifying extremist group of Democrats, you're seeing it happen.
And he is determined to take back power from any source, you see their compulsion, their wickedness.
They don't care who's hurting, and who's crying to get power and control, they just need power and control, and we won't give them these two things.
He said the Democrats were on a mission to “protest and obstruct”.
He described the Democrats as "infuriating and reckless and mischievous and liars," and said, "And you've seen this in the last four days."
He cited the name of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking, which led to some voices being heard by the attendees.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Have you read the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, he was really a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
The church is no longer a large church.
He does not tolerate those who speak in their hearts.
It's no surprise that people in my local community have been protesting against me.
Finally, I am the latest addition to the rank of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not favorites - just because we speak of the heart.
My parliamentary colleague, young Ryan, also faced a similar attitude because they stood up against Jewish enmity.
In my case, the Malawian movement slammed me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on similar issues that Jeremy does not agree with former leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want to make the meetings confusing and boring."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, it has not been the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "compassionate and polite" policy has long been forgotten, of course, even if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that opposition opinions are not being tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is seen with reference to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This has happened soon after Jeremy became the leader, because with me, those who previously thought I had a political point of view like me, began to expect me to take a U-turn and take a position that I would never otherwise agree with - whether it's national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - whatever I say - there is a rain of satire and criticism on social media and demands for a rejection and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments about me are political in nature.
I am surprised to see the professionalism and commitment of colleagues who tolerate abuse on the basis of sexual and racial discrimination every day but do not give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of politics of this era is how levels of abuse have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should promote the tradition of toleration.
The fact is that we are no longer that wide-ranging church, and the party becomes more narrow-minded with the change of each no-confidence motion or election rules.
Over the past two years, I've been highly advised to keep my head down, not to be so clear-headed, then I'll be "absolutely fine."
I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago as a school pupil I have joined Labour because of the recklessness of the Thatcher government that brought my Comprehensive School class to a close, I have tried to do better public service for those who need it most - whether as a local counselor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has in any way been confused about my position on policy and disagreements with the current leadership.
As for the people who moved on Friday, I will only say that while the country is heading towards Brexit, which will harm families, businesses and our public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on proving my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But just a message that I would like to give not only to the voters of Nottingham, but also to the voters of my constituency, whether I am a Labour member or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of rejection threats or political will prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
IR 17-38 Mileage: Unsubdued IR reaches top
Two late attempts could have created some upside down in the final result, but there is no doubt that Ir had the privilege of winning in the surprise and thrilling match of the Tennessean Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only team out of ten that has not been defeated.
In the end, due to their excellent defense and better ability to take the chance, they were successful and coach Peter Morchi had the absolute right to be happy.
"We have been tested in our game so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Milros said: "Ire is credited, they took better chances than us.
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which Fraser Klimo converted in the score, gave Ir the lead, but Scotland captain Rory Hughes had the opportunity to increase the number to Milros when he received a yellow card, and Jason Bogott made a try.
Klimo tightened the lead of the IR with a penalty in exactly half-time. They scored then converted the single effort into a score and scored 5-17 in the break.
But Milros started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was replaced by Bogotá, made
The match was halted for a long time due to the severe injury to Roard Nott, and Ir went further when the game resumed when Stafford McDowell's attempt was replaced by Clemson.
Then Ir's vice-captain, Blair McFarlane, was shown the yellow card, and again Milros took advantage of the additional player's presence, and Bruce Colvin tried something that could not be changed.
The host team returned to play, but when Steven Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for tackling the ball without a ball, McFarlane put the ball into the net on a growing eye attack.
Klimo scored as he did at the restart. Before that, Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and beat Gregor Henry to a fifth attempt to host.
Searching for a new career in the steel game star restaurant industry
Stell's star Ford Karenan is set to move into the hosting industry and it has been discovered that his name is among the directors of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he co-wrote and presents with long-time comedy partner Greg Humphrey.
The two have announced that the next nine series will be the final series of the show and it seems that Karenan is planning to leave forever after Craig Lang.
According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has declined to comment on the news, although Scottish Sun sources have said that Karen is suspected of being involved in Glasgow's 'growing restaurant trade'.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia's Hague court expects to reopen route to Pacific
In Lapaz, the sailors are patrolling around the naval headquarters of a shipwrecked ship.
The blue flag is hoisting on government buildings.
On the seabeds from Lake Tetica to Amazon, it is written: "Our right to the sea.
"We have to get him back."
The memory of Chile's loss to the coast in a bloody clash in the 19th century across Bolivia is still fresh - as well as a desire to sail the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations are now at their highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after a five-year process.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said that Bolivia has a spirit of strength, unity and resilience and expects results with a positive outlook.
Many Bolivian citizens will see the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, with the hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that Chile is responsible for negotiating with it to give Bolivia an autonomous way to the sea after decades of uneven negotiations.
Bolivian President Evo Morales has also had to wait for Monday's decision.
He had vowed in August that his country would be very close to returning to the Pacific.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will make a ruling in favor of Bolivia - and even if it does, there will be no major change.
The United Nations court in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction to hand over Chile's territory to them, and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is being given just six months after the last injury was heard shows that the case was "not complicated."
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, the last four years may have damaged it.
Zarate said the issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by Bolivia's current administration.
He said that the controversial rhetoric of Morales has also put an end to the rest of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Voltaire, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, has rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
He said Monday is an extraordinary opportunity for Bolivia to start a new era of relations with Chile and end 139 years of non-cooperation for mutual benefit.
Calzedilla denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political tool.
He added that Bolivia would never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
The court's decision is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.
North Korea: Nuclear disarmament without trust in the United States is unacceptable
North Korea's foreign minister, Ryong Ho, said his country would never give up nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last week.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the summit between the two leaders in Singapore.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy three months after meeting North Korea's Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "rare notion" that the U.S. objection to the continuation of sanctions and the announcement of an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel down.
Washington is cautious about making the announcement without taking significant steps to mitigate the threat posed by Pyongyang.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread suspicions that Pyongyang is serious about reducing weapons that it considers to be the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Large-sized headwear exhibition at the Paris Fashion Show
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or stop the sun completely, don't wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have showcased large-sized headwear on the runway for their SS19 collection that garnered a style set at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, there was an amazing variety of hats on Instagram and these designers have sent their great works to Kate Walk.
One of Valentino's most prominent features was a high seed-colored hat decorated with wide edges such as pennies, which covered the heads of the models.
Other large-sized accessories include jeweled watermelon, maggot hat and an ananas-shaped hat - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom also revealed the selection of the wonderful type of masks - which are being presented on the occasion of Ain Halloween.
Many of the colorful burgeoning masks had their lips sewn, and they looked Hannibal Lecter instead of modern fashion.
One of them was scuba diving gear with goggles and snorkel, while the other one looked like melted ice cream.
And if you continue the fashion statement - you're lucky.
It is predicted that a large number of such bundles are going to become the ornaments of the markets near you.
The large-sized hats have come to light after a hat made of tannins called "La Bomba" whose heads were two feet wide and were seen on everyone's head from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The group label behind this highly ineffective type of hat that went viral on the entire social media has brought yet another major innovation to the catwalk - a coastal bag made of tannins that is almost as big as the one worn in a swimsuit.
In the Paris Fashion Week, the orange-colored Raffia bag that was burned at the Jacuzzi La Riviera SS19 with a raffia fringe and white leather handle on the edges was the most prominent.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the arrival of large-sized hats and coastal bags in the big markets for the next summer - because the designer has left such a big impact that it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.
John Edwards: Language Skills Required for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent school education continued to maintain a track record of excellence, and the record also continued in 2018 with excellent test results, which have been reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide students and parents with the best level of service.
Independent schools prepare their students for the next and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As a department of education that can develop and apply a best school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages within schools as a popular and preferred subject.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, he goes to his head.
If you speak to a man in his own language, he descends into his heart.
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English in establishing relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent test, we can see that the languages in independent schools are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing rate.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received a higher grade A.
Data collected from 74 member schools of SCIS showed that 72% of students received a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72% of German readers, 69% of French readers and 63% of Spanish readers also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a choice of subjects in the free school curriculum and elsewhere are now the same status as STEM subjects (science, technology engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons for the difficulty in filling vacant seats showed a lack of language skills.
Language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As languages are becoming more and more necessary for job opportunities, these skills have become essential in today's world.
Regardless of career choices, if someone has learned a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future due to having such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries puts a multi-ethnic person ahead of the competition.
According to the YouGov poll, which surveyed more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of people were not able to speak a foreign language well and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit rate, i.e. 15%.
This is why it is important to invest in language learning for today's children.
Skilling in several languages, especially developing economies, increases the chances of getting good jobs for children.
Within Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a selection of languages available in independent schools and a teaching staff with expertise in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing an educational environment that equips and prepares children with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today's global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that languages are very important for the future of the country, so they should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and discrimination to the youth of Scotland.
It proved to be fair.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will start playing for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
For fans who want to see Lee Brown playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Niggers in Sunday's pre-season opening match in San Diego.
He didn't know how many minutes he would play.
Walton said on Lakers' website that it would take less than 48 minutes.
Lakers reporter Mike Troddle tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans regarding Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's time for the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Trump is launching a series of election rallies from the West Virginia area this evening.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies scheduled for next week, including a short stop at friendly destinations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his election pending a confirmation vote on the Supreme Court's vacant seat, Trump is seeking public support for the mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia Rally Night and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearing for his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become strained due to allegations of sexual misconduct and the expected Senate confirmation vote has been postponed for a week until the FBI investigation is completed.
The main objective of the rally is to help the Republicans get on with their campaigning for the November election.
So, according to Reuters, the administration of President Trump's election campaign said the rally next week was aimed at "incentivizing volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to save and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
A spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters: "It's so important for the president's agenda to maintain control of Congress that he will visit as many states as possible while we're on our way to a busy transitional season."
According to West Virginia Metro News, the tonight's rally scheduled at Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling "will gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and gain coverage of the Pittsburgh media."
This will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia last month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls for the Senate.
Simon Hyder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said it was not a good sign for Morrissey that he had to come to the president to get ahead in the polls.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA's Commitment to Competitively Maintaining Hopes to Go to Sunday's Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the rider's cup was the same as the pairs on the afternoon of the week.
Moving the amount of a swinging pendulum is completely an invented game concept, but a concept in which players believe in heart, and will never have happened as much as in competitions like these.
Then they will say, 'Where is that [place]?'
Walking on that day, Jordan Spyth said, "They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I think we're taking it as a little bit of a move."
Of course, Europe is leading, with four points ahead, while they can try to get twelve more.
As Spyth said, Americans feel that their senses are still a little recovered and they have enough to hope for, especially in the case of Spyth and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and each earned four to three points.
Spyth has been fatal in terms of putting the ball into the hole and he has set an example.
While their round was going on, the fans' screams were getting louder when they put the ball into the hole with a lighter multiplier and made a four-to-four match name - at a time when Thomas and they were two points behind.
When the 15-year-old won the game, fans cheered in a way that tells you that the U.S. team is not out of the game yet.
Spyth says you just have to work hard and worry about it for your match.
All of these players are now gone.
There are 18 holes left.
The only players who have scored more points than Spyth and Thomas in the past two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Flatwood, a Muslim story from the Rider Cup.
Europe's team is amazing but this desirable pair is perfect and does not expect to make a mistake from them.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a single bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also saved bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and then again on Friday morning.
This race and the manner in which their energy is transferred from and to the crowd of this stormy spectator reinforces the belief that they are the only players who will be able to win on Sunday and that there will be no popular players other than Flatwood or Mulinari in comparison to them who can ensure the European team's possible victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably on different holes together.
It's time for Europe's greatness.
Boba Watson and Web Simpson finished the hero of the morning foreballs immediately after his pairing with Alex Norrin.
In the first nine holes, a bogey and two doubles threw the Spanish and Swedish pair into a hole from which they could never get close to getting out.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of the hole.
The interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the manner in which a strategy changes in a moment, makes it great to watch the morning four-ball and afternoon four-sams.
So far, the European team has shown a good game as a team and has maintained its dominance until the last day, but this Forces Session has shown that the team has the courage to compete in the USA as well, something that some people, especially the State Side, have been skeptical about.
Europe lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
The United States will show up with a clear lead on the final day of the European Ryder Cup after gaining a 10-6 lead in the four-balls and four-sams matches on Saturday.
Tommy Flatwood and Francisco Molinari's passionate pairing started with two victories over the conflict-torn Tiger Woods and have so far taken their tally to four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Byron's European team, which is trying to maintain its trophy lost in Hazelton two years ago, dominated the U.S. team in the morning's Foreballs competition and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the Forces competition and won two matches, but failed to meet the deficit.
Jim Furuk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy.
Flatwood is the European team's first rook (new recruits) to score four points in a row while their pairing with Molinari, which is named from "Mollywood," is the first pair in the history of the Rider Cup after a sensational weekend that has earned four points in its first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reid in the four-balls, they beat the best-of-the-best together defeating retailer Woods and American Rocky Bryson Dachambio by a much stronger 5&4 lead.
Woods, who was hard-hitting in two matches on Saturday, demonstrated a sense of coincidence, but he has lost 19 of 29 of his four-balls and four-sams, and seven of them consecutively.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's Four Balls competitions, returned to support Henrik Stinson in the Four Sims and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keepka - whose world rankings are first and third - by 2&1.
The European team could not make it through a pleasant and windy day in the south-western region of Paris.
Three-time major championship winners Jordan Spyth and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won by a 2&1 over Spain's John Rham and Ain Polter in the Four Balls, and later defeated Polter and McLaren by 4&3 after losing two opening holes in the Four Sims.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has been able to return to the game after losing four points while going to singles, although Furuk's team only needed to equal the match to maintain the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, however, it appears that the counter-attack will be out of their reach on Sunday.
North Korea says it is unilaterally unarmed without a "question of confidence."
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions is undermining their country's confidence in the United States, and there is no question that their country unilaterally withdraws from its nuclear arsenal.
Ryong Ho told the World Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, eliminating nuclear testing sites, and vowing to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, however, that there was no response from the United States.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under no circumstances will we be the first unilaterally unarmed.
While Ree reiterated North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-war" nuclear weapon strategy, his statement appears remarkable that he did not reject a unilateral deterrence weapon as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Reid cited a joint statement issued after the first summit between current US President and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim vowed to make efforts to "denuclearize the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War of 53-1950, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first disarm its nuclear arsenal.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing tougher international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "first-depletion nuclear weapons" and forcibly raises the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal, and is even objecting to the "announcement of an end to war," he said.
The idea that restrictions can force us to kneel is a flawed notion of people who don't know about us.
The problem, however, is that the restrictions continue to increase distrust.
He did not mention the plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president had previously highlighted at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister specifically mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of this disarmament was South Korea's side, and not the United States, there would be no such a pause in the disarmament in the Korean region."
Despite this, the tone of Rea's speech was dramatically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it had become impossible to target America's soil with North Korea's rockets after "Mr. Satanic President" Trump described Kim as a "rocketed man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised the U.N. for taking steps toward denuclearization this year, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea's nuclear arsenal is dismantled.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, no matter if it took two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia argue that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions should continue with intensity and without pause until we achieve the goal of a complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea with consensus since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rea on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
While departing from Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making "hound-like demands."
North Korea has also promised to dismantle a missile facility and a nuclear complex in a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes "responsible measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "responsible measures" he wanted included security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
A large number of Harvard students attend the course to get a good night's sleep.
Harvard University has encouraged all its undergraduate students to get more sleep this year under a new course to combat the tradition of increased masculinity through "all-night awakening" with the help of caffeine.
An educator found that students at the world's number one university are often unaware when it comes to the most basic things, such as how to take care of yourself.
Charles Cessler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
After making a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on the reading process, they were motivated to start the course.
He said, “When I was a little girl, I was like, ‘Why do I have to do this when I’m in my senior year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - a fact that surprised me.
The course, which began this year for the first time, explains how good sleeping habits help with academic and sports performance, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Brera, a professor of mental illness at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
An hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
A section contains a picture of the hostel room, in which students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive images encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that this will not change the attitude of the students immediately.
However, we think they have a right to know - just like you have a right to know about its effects on health when choosing to smoke.
He said the tradition of feeling proud of "the whole night awake" still exists and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said that to make sure you get enough sleep, students should have a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety - even to avoid obesity, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them feel constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student, Raymond Soe, who is studying chemical and medical biology, has helped Professor Paul Cessler develop a course he took last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and created a desire to try to start the course throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is for all postgraduate students to complete the same type of education program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cessler has recommended that students should consider putting alarms on when to go to bed and when to wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ emanating from electrical screens and LED lighting. This light can cause sleep problems by causing imbalances in your night-time change system.
Winning by a Zero on Livingston's Rangers: Manga hits Gerard's goal
The Rangers were another blow of concern when a multiplier of Dolly Manga beat Steven Gerrard's unbeaten team by a goal against Zero in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking to record their first win after a 4-1 win at St John's in February, but Gary Holt's team put his second defeat on Gerard as manager in 18 games and kept his team away from Leeds Premiership Leaders Harts by just eight points.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the enthusiastic Rangers team never missed it.
While the Rangers are now sixth, Livingston has jumped to third place and is only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
There may be more difficulties for Gerard when he was injured in the head by apparently throwing something from the other end on the Linesman Column Spence.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, leading to the semi-finals of the IR Batford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livi 11 that gave a point from Hurts last week and would have been pleased with the way his turnout at every turn made the opponents sneeze.
The Rangers may have been in control, but Langston kept the ball under his control.
They could only score within two minutes of the start of the game when Menga was dismissed for the first time by Scott Pattman in the goal by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder saved on time.
By the time Kegan Jacobs reached the free-kick captain Craig Hollitz, his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only throw the ball back to the post.
The Rangers certainly had control over the game, but in the last third they could only be expected, rather than confident about their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he would get a penalty on the quarter-hour mark when he and Steven Lalis clashed, but referee Steven Thomson rejected Colombia's appeals.
Rangers could only shoot two shots at the target in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face any major problems from Lasana Kolibali's head and Ovi Azariah's weak shot.
While Levy's opener in the 34th minute could have been against the game's breeze, no one can deny that this was their first need.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' move.
Scott Arfield did not respond in time when Deacon Gallagher threw the ball towards Scott Robinson and he chose Manga to finish his move with a cool temperament.
In the break, Gerard substituted Ryan Kent in place of Colebaly, and the change showed an almost immediate effect when the winger gave the ball to Morelos, but the influencer Kelly ran out of his line in time to stop him.
But Livingston continued to force guests to play the game of their own free will when Lithgow and Halkitt continued to shoot long shots one after the other.
Holt's team could have added their lead to the final stage when Lithgro threw headers from the corner to Jacobs, but McGregor came on the way and failed their attempt.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton claimed a penalty kick when he confused with Jacobs, but was ignored by Thomson.
Title: The Counter-Strike
And now a page from the calendar of "Sunday Morning": 136 years ago today, counting, on September 30, 1882, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Gaeger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which was an invention that eventually led to a device called the Geiger Counter.
It has since been one of the biggest backers not only of science but also of pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which seemingly unlikely goofy scientists are Roy Rogers and Dale Evans actors:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's the gagger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these airphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radiation-causing atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, it's really poppin' up!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention attributed to his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to ‘see’ the cells.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to ‘see’ the cells and kill them
This vaccine helps to identify the immune system as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from a patient and turning them into a lab.
Then they can ‘see’ a protein (the lymphatic system) that is common in many cancers and then these cells are re-introduced into the body.
The vaccine has shown promising results in different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with this vaccine had been missing for more than 18 months from her uterus, a vaccine that trains immunity to identify bacterial cells.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from a patient, converting them into labs so that they can "see" the common proteins found in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-introducing these cells into the body.
Professor J. Berzowski of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we now have a highly promising vaccine.
Professor Berzowski noted that HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancers" including breast, fetal, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers.
A similar strategy of taking immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has also been successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after his SNL performance, praised Trump wearing a MAGA hat
That's not a good thing to do!
Fans expressed disapproval of Kanye West during his out-of-the-box performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would fight for the presidency again in 2020 after he was seen at the "Sacher's Day Night" live show at the studio.
That night, after presenting his third song, Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a hat that made America great, he shouted slogans against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white man and he says, 'How can we like Trump, he's a racist?'
He said, "If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved to the United States a long time ago."
The SNL began the show with Matt Damon in a socket in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of the testimony against himself by Brett Cavano's St.'s Judicial Committee's Robert Blasey Ford's claim of sexual harassment.
Although it was not broadcast, West's Herza Serai was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wants to ridicule West through this post.
In addition, West complained to fans that he had a hard time behind the stage because of his hat.
"They beat me up on the stage.
He said, “Don’t go on stage with this hat.”
They've threatened me!
According to the Washington Examiner, he then told me he was in a kneeling position."
West added: "Do you want to see a kneeling place?" she added that she would "keep wearing her Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test the love."
Verity magazine reported that the fans expressed their disapproval at least twice because of her comments and that SNL officials were looking worried.
West was brought in as an alternative to singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West, dressed like a Pierce bottle, had confused many fans with his song ‘I Love Her’.
West was backed by Candice Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "Hello to one of the most inspiring spirits: thanks for fighting the mob."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply expressing his personality and that's absolutely amazing.
"However, I have chosen not to reward a person (by buying his music, or clothing, or by supporting his "fan") who I think has had a vision of his and her that is detrimental to my community.
He is free.
"We are free," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now he is "officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first fan to have changed his name and is walking in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Paddy.
The name of the fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was Snoop Line, and of course the former legend of music Prince had changed his name to a symbol.
Man charged with attempted murder in Belfast restaurant's Knife-War
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder for stabbing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Bali.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kat Harrington's criticism of male genital mutilation
Cutt Harrington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old criticised the hero's gripping tradition of showing masculinity and said that showing such a character on screen meant that young boys often felt that they would have to be tough to be honored.
Speaking to The Sunday Times, Cutt said he understood “something went wrong” and asked how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Cutt, who has recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that she is serious about tackling the issue.
He said: "I am personally serious about where we have gone wrong in promoting masculinity.
What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, regarding the problem we are seeing now?
Cutt understands that television may be partially responsible for the promotion of toxic masculinity due to its extreme masculinity roles.
And they said, “What is the meaning of the word, and what is the meaning of the word?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, makes boys feel that they have to adopt a certain attitude to be male.
I think this is a big question of our time - how do we change this trend?
"It's clear that something is wrong with the education of young men."
He also admitted in the interview that when the Game of Thrones series ends next summer, he won't do any more series like this, because he's "feeling tired of battle and horses on the field."
From November, Cutt will be a film producer and his brother who will appear in the remake of Sam Shepherd's film True West, based on the story of a robber.
The actor recently expressed the fact that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is one of the best gifts he has received from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and a new life ahead of her.
Rose played the role of Jon Snow's love interest agaret in the fantasy series that won the Emmy Award.
They tied the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family keeper in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say more than 820,000 people are affected by it in the country.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were affected by sexual intercourse, which is contrary to the tradition of the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood transfusions in parts of China.
At a conference in the province of Greece, Chinese medical officials said that the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero.
However, over the years, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China has reached 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was declared an unconstitutional act in China, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is still common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Most cases of transmission of these diseases are due to inappropriate sexual protections in such relationships.
To address this problem, the Chinese government has promised to provide equitable access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies her Staffer leaked GOP Senator’s data, strongly condemning ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘social theories’
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican senators on the legislators' wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insisted that such claims were being made by pundits and websites of "extremely right-wingers."
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: "It's all lies, lies, and more lies.
The information allegedly released included addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham and Mike Lee of Ottawa and Ornan Hach's homes from South Carolina.
Information appeared online on Thursday, which was published during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by an unidentified man from Capitol Hill.
The information was leaked shortly after senators objected to Kevano.
Hill reported conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and Red State reported that IP addresses indicating the source of the posts were linked to the Office of Waters and also released information from a member of the Waters crew.
Waters added that this baseless accusation is completely false and an open lie.
My staff member whose identity, personal information and security have been threatened as a result of these frivolous and false allegations is not responsible for leaking these information in any way.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an open lie.
Waters' statement was immediately criticised online, including former White House press secretary Arie Fleisher.
Philipp said that it was infuriating.
This shows that she is not interested in being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be angry.
They shouldn't be forced to work.
They should not question the intention of the accused.
They need to be calm and respectful."
It seemed that Flesher Waters' response was being compared to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Cavano, who accused Cavano of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He said: "If it's true, it's good news.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and enforcement law agencies regarding these frivolous claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are brought to the scene and held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any other member of my staff," he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again - A Critical Review of the Unbelievable Spy Ron Atkinson
It has now become a tradition to see the importance of Brexit in the new film of any British perspective, but this doesn't justify this update to Johnny English's action comedy of the evil Emmys franchise, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was re-released in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to make sure that we have a clear picture of how much we're going to get out of this mess?
In any case, the eye-catching and rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English had a license to refresh things a second time - and that his hint is a broader comic creation designed for non-English cinematic areas than anything else.
He is undoubtedly a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange words, has a little bit of classo's insider qualities, Mr. Bean's splendour and only one head of Chariots of Fire's Thematic Head Tale at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
His role is originally based on the traveler and interlocutor of Atkinson, who once appeared in Barclay Card's TV ads and left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two good moments in this latest JE Outing.
I'm glad I was able to get to the top of the hill with a steering wheel and a steering wheel.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is on display, but in the comedy he's not a soul and looks oddly crafted, especially the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are now offering comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The comic feels like it's for younger children rather than adults, and for me Jonny English's lyric movements are not as focused and modern as Atkinson's silent movie movements in Ben's character.
Now the permanent regional judgeship is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a highly secretive web network of spies and is revealing the identities of all British agents in the field. He has now become a pain-head for an agent on duty.
This is the last resort for a prime minister who is the heartbroken weakened character of Shawn and Shaukat, who is already in complete political disrepute. Emma Thompson plays the role of partial Theresa May best but doesn't have much life in the script.
Their intelligence advisers inform that because every active spy is in danger, they will have to bring a retired person.
And that means bringing the slim of mistakes to the forefront of Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a disguised area, but offers off-the-record lessons about becoming a spy: here in some places it is difficult to stop laughing because Johnny runs the School of Rock kind of academy.
Johnny is brought to the White Hall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-time partner Bough, who is playing Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, Submarine Commander, the role of a Julie Hawkins Stokes in which Wikipedian is a bit of a nuisance.
So the queen's secret service returns to the action of doing things in the way of Batman and Robin, in which Olga Korilenko faces the Hasina month's Jabin Ophelia Boltofá.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously runs the magic of a Wii U tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the misguided Jason Volta, whose role is played by Jack Lacy.
Jonny and Bo begin their story with their funny coloring reels; in the form of waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxurious boat and create chaos; and Jonny tries to use the English-speaking Almukic to be the insider of Volta's house when he tries to use the Volta's.
Of course all the breaks have been saved for this final episode, but the more charming and stormy this game is, the whole movie looks like you're watching children's TV.
There is enough medium-sized material.
And as with other films by Jonny English, I'm always forced to wonder if the British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would be fair to his ability?
The Labour Party has denied plans for UK residents to work four days a week, but took five days to pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan under which British citizens will work four days a week, but pay for five days.
According to reports, the party wants the company's bosses to transfer the savings earned by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving their workers an extra day off.
Under this, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend - but the home salary will be taken as much as before.
Sources said the concept would be “suitable” for the party’s economic agenda and plans that want to bow down to the country’s workers.
The transition to a four-day week has been ratified by the Union Congress to benefit workers from a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but the four-day car week is a movement that is suitable for the party's overall industrial strategy, in addition to rebalancing the economy for workers.
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole is not acknowledging this concept.
A Labour party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration by the party.
Opposition Chancellor John MacDonald used the Labor Conference last week to present his idea of bringing a socialist revolution to the economy.
Mr MacDonald said he was determined to take back power from ‘non-faced directors’ and anti-fascists’ in utility firms.
The opposition's chancellor also means that existing shareholders in water companies will not be able to get their full share back because the Labour government can 'cut' due to perceived mismanagement.
He also confirmed plans to set up a jointly owned fund to include workers on the company's boards and hand over 10 per cent of the private sector firms to employees, which will earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Landsey Graham, John Kennedy "60 Minutes" Tells If The FBI's Investigation Against Kiwanis Will Change Their Minds
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises questions about whether the Bureau's investigation will force a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Peale asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI would find something that would persuade them to change their mind.
Kennedy looked more babyish than he was with him from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course (maybe)."
I spoke to the judge, and I spoke to the judge.
After the charges came up, I called Kevin and said, "What did you do?"
He was determined, determined, and two-pointed.
However, there was no sign of Graham's intention.
He said that his opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is irrelevant and that there should be a dynamite charge to change it.
With Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has strongly denied it.
No one can confirm the name of the person.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any major changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This week, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, which is an annual music festival in which many famous singers perform their feats and as much influence is its mission; the eradication of global poverty.
In its seventh year, several thousand people at the Global Citizen Festival will gather in the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the singing of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also to create awareness about its true goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively working against poverty.
A free ticket for the fair (if you want to pay for a VIP ticket is a separate thing) requires concert fans to complete some task or "application", such as volunteer work, emailing a global leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful step to create awareness about the purpose of poverty alleviation.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal, while now only 12 years are left?
Is the concept of offering free concerts to people a real way to persuade people to take practical action, or is there another form of ‘cliquetism’, in which people think they are doing a great job by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded 19 million "applications" of its supporters in support of various target demands since 2011.
These actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements generated from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds received so far have directly impacted about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and enforcers in the UK, and she is committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen to help eliminate $35 million in nutritional deficiencies in Rwanda.
Tracey Alman, the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018 that with the help of the British government, restrictions, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of poor nutrition a thing of the past.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 demands from the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced to fund a project, Power of Nutrition, under which 5 million women and children in need of nutrition will be benefited.
In response to a question on our website, "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It's a long and difficult journey - sometimes we fall and fail."
But, like the movements for civil rights and against racial injustice, we succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Some of the performers at this year's event in New York include Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Genel Mona.
U.S. could use its navy for 'blockade' to disrupt Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zanke has revealed, as Washington Examiner reported, that Washington "uses its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, if necessary."
Zanke has alleged that Russian involvement in Syria is an excuse to seek new energy markets, and that Russia is the country's leader at the invitation of the Syrian government.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is to promote energy as they are doing in Eastern Europe, which is the southernmost stomach of Europe.
They have ways and means to deal with it.
He said the United States has the capability through its navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, to close them so that their energy does not reach the market.
Zanke was speaking at an event organised by the Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategy to deal with Russia and Iran and effectively maligned them.
Referring to Russia as "a trick-or-treating horse whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels, he said the economic option for Iran and Russia is to rely more and more on fossil fuels and change it.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, which is a more affordable option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the current pipeline's capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin has argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unscriptural competition.
After a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said: "I think energy should not be used as a tool to increase pressure and consumers should be able to manipulate suppliers."
Germany has strongly criticized the U.S. position and reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry body, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I am deeply saddened when a third country interferes in our energy supply."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "seriously consider" taking part in the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "seriously consider" participating in the presidential election after mid-term elections.
During a town hall meeting in the Holocaust area of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider participating in the election.
"The time has come for women to turn to Washington and fix our broken government and that requires a woman in power," he said.
He said he would seriously consider fighting for the president's election after November 6.
Warren took a dig at President Donald Trump during the town hall and said, "They're taking this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has been critical of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that Warren's majority in his constituency said he should not participate in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Political Research Center/Boston Globe of the University of Suffolk, 58 percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said they should not participate in the election.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of the election.
The survey showed more support for former governor Dave Patrick's participation, with 38% supporting potential participation and 48% opposing it.
The other high-profile Democratic nominees to run for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Sixteen-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
He told a rally for Donald Trump in the Oklahoma region of Telsa that after coming from the conditions under which my son is going through, I can feel the pain of other families who are suffering from PTSD and the injuries with which our soldiers return.
Palin called his arrest a "unarmed elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war soldiers "they come back a little bit different, they come back a little tougher, they come back wondering whether what they do for the country, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army, is valued or not."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasila Police Department, Trek Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of intoxication.
18 states support to challenge DC's new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to people fleeing bullying or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from eighteen states and the district filed a request for cooperation with the court in support of the challenge to the policy by refugees in Washington on Friday.
The full name of the caller was not revealed in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the U.S. Civil Rights Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner and "sons of her violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for Greece-backed states such as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have described it as the country that generates the highest number of applicants for U.S. asylum as those countries face major problems of domestic violence and homicide.
The U.S.'s new policy on asylum is against the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia's Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
The request for cooperation with the court states that federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim and that the policy violates this principle.
In the application, the lawyers further argued that the policy of blocking the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy as such individuals could become carers and "provide essential labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give more shelter to those fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11, saying that asylum is only available to those who leave their home country for fear of intimidation or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality, or a particular social group or political opinion.
Giving shelter was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Efforts are underway to save the lives of the victims in Palo Alto, doubling the number of casualties.
The situation was worse for the survivors.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kosoma, comforted her son with a fever at a relief center in the affected city of Palo, saying the situation was very tense.
Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Locals have been seen going back to their destroyed homes, trying to pick up the stuff that was submerged in water and what was left.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude quake were filled with some of the injured.
Doi Haris, who had suffered a fracture in his waist and shoulder, was resting outside the Army Hospital in Palau, where patients were being treated outside the building due to earthquake shocks.
Tears began to flow from his eyes when he was struck by a severe earthquake that shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
He didn't have time to save himself.
Harris told the Associated Press that I was trapped in the debris of the walls, adding that they had come to the town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they will be safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threatening" propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese state-run newspaper published a four-page ad about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited China's daily supplements in the Iowa state's highest-selling newspaper Des Moines Register after accusing China of trying to meddle in the November 6 U.S. election.
Trump accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election is a new stage in Washington's growing campaign to increase pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, a fierce trade war between Beijing and Washington is currently underway in which they have announced several rounds of tariffs on each other's exports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's counter-tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters in states that supported Trump's Republican Party, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa and a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China was increasing the threat by running propaganda ads in our free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of every liberal American freedom of expression and free press tradition by making paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register.
Instead, on the newsstands in the streets of China, you'll hear limited voices against the government and you won't see the true reflection of the Chinese people's real opinions about China's troubled economic policy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers tried to deny his offer to share his article, but did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts have warned that Republicans are defying women's suffrage ahead of mid-term elections due to the Québécois domination.
As many Republicans are defending the Supreme Court nominee Brett Lee over several allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned they will face her reaction in the coming mid-term election, especially from women.
The sentiment in this regard is much higher than before, and most Republicans have publicly said they want to have an opinion on it.
Grant River, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday that you can't ignore these things.
Rihr said he did not believe that the demand for an FBI investigation at the last minute by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to convince angry voters.
According to the Washington D.C. newspaper, the national spokesperson and senior adviser to the Progressive Group on Moving forward, Karen Jean-Pierre, said women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and even in November.
Mack reported that while protesting in the Senate debacle on Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" The demonstration came as Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue Cavano's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
An independent political analyst, Sto Rathenberg, told the news site that the Democratic sentiment and motivation would be unpredictable.
People say it's too high, and it's true.
But these emotions can be even higher, especially among swing female voters and young voters in the suburbs, 18-29-year-olds, who often don't vote because they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court-appointed judge, analysts suggested he would have a tougher reaction if Republicans decided to continue with the verification vote.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week that it had become a buzzword for the GOP.
Priorities USA, director of a group that helps in the election of Democrats, Guy Cecil told the news channel that the issue is not just whether the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kevin is included in the bench, but also how the Republicans dealt with the issue and how they dealt with it (Christine).
However, after the testimony of Ford and Cavano, it seems that the Americans are bent on believing who to believe, while the latter has little advantage.
A new poll by YouGov showed that 41 people believed Ford's testimony to be certain or perhaps true, while 35 percent said they believed Quinoa to be certain or perhaps true.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Cavano might or certainly lied during the testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reported that following Fleck's demand, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by at least one other plaintiff, besides Ford, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Robredo, stated that Cavano abused her when she was 17 years old when she was intoxicated.
Ramirez alleged that a judge nominated to the Supreme Court revealed his embarrassment to him during a party in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's founder plans to launch a new internet compared to Google and Facebook
World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee is planning to launch a new internet compared to Google, Amazon and Facebook.
Technology Legend's latest project Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
SOLD allows users to determine where their data is stored and which information is allowed to be accessed.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "global dominance".
He said we have to do it now.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses SOLD technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Store" or a POD.
This includes a list of contacts, a list of tasks to do, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that the user has the option of who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authority by data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the concept of Inrupt is that the company gathers resources, procedures, and appropriate skills to make SOLD available to everyone.
A security platform currently purchased by the company Burners Lee, Bruce, IBM, consists of a community of on-site developers and volunteer coders who have been put on contract to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were "talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that would disrupt all business models overnight."
"We're not asking for permission.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an eco-system that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
Berners-Lee changed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added that he is very optimistic about the next phase of the web.
Bernard Vaughn: A ceremony in honor of the priest who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
During World War I, the ceremony was held in their native town on the 100th anniversary of the only Church of England to win the Victoria Cross.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van received the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellingleys and Lehcourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a raid and was never found out that he had won the British Army's highest honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons in the Northamptonshire area of Rushden unveiled a monumental stone during a parade.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said that it was “excellently symbolic” that the stone appeared exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning work.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan carried his battalion across the De Saint-Quentin River "in very deep fog and very intense firing from field and machine guns."
Later, he quickly moved to the firing line and led his line forward with a field gun running alone and "greatest hitter" before dropping three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German raid on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's accomplishments were something he could never accomplish, but was a humble national service.
After the parade, he and his brother, Dr. James Van, wore a floral cap led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he felt honored to participate in the parade and "the bravery of an actual hero is being demonstrated by a lot of people."
MMA fans wake up to watch Bellator 206, instead they got pappy pug
Imagine you're a tortoise who wakes up all night to watch the Bellator 206 just because you're missing out on the main event.
The San Jose ticket included 13 matches, including six matches on the main card, which were being shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6 a.m., as Gardner Moss and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, spectators in the UK were shocked when Cowridge turned into a piggyback.
Some people woke up early in the morning to this problem.
One of the fans on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of ridiculous joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Bellator, said it was the government's regulation that such content was not suitable for 6 a.m. so they had to move to a children's program.
"Yes, the pope.
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator, said he was working on his schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think when we think about replays, I think we might be able to find a solution.
But there are Sundays at 6 a.m. and we will not be able to broadcast it according to our time on Sunday, Monday, according to them.
But we are working on it.
Be sure that when these changes were made, many text messages were being received and not all of them were friendly.
We are trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical error.
It was not a government problem.
I promise it won't happen.
We'll be competing in five competitions instead of six - as we normally do. We tried to give the fans more fun and we couldn't do it.
This is a disappointing situation.
Desert Island Discus: Tom Daley felt ‘less’ because of his sexuality
Olympic champion Tom Daly says his sexuality grew up with the feeling of being waist-deep - but that prompted him to become a successful person.
Tom, 24, said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking at the Desert Island Discus program of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Lauren, he said that to ‘give hope’ to others, he talks about gay rights.
He said that being a father made him careless about winning the Olympics.
Christy Young, the long-running show's regular director, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a performer at Lauren's first program, Daly stated that she grew up with the feeling that she was "less than anyone else" because the thing was not socially acceptable to boys and girls.
He said, to this day, the feelings of being less and the feeling of being different gave me the strength and ability to succeed.
She said she wanted to prove that she was "something" because she didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about her sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has appealed to more countries at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to condemn homosexuality.
He said he is speaking openly because he feels lucky that he was able to live a normal life without being followed and that he wants to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said it was surprising for him to be in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daly married Oscar-winning Dustin, who is 20 years older than her, last year, but the age difference never made the problem.
She said that at such a young age when you had to go through so many things - she went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - that it was difficult to find someone of her age who had seen such a high altitude.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Day in June, and Daly reported that he changed the perspective about his life.
He said, "If you had talked to me last year, I would have said everything about winning a gold medal.
Did you know that there are more important things than winning gold medals at the Olympics?
My Olympic gold medal is ruby.
His son is named after his real father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
The Daily said he didn't accept that Dad was going to die and the last thing he asked was if he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the next row.
He said, "I don't think you're going to be able to sit in the front row.
He told me that I held his hand when he took his last breath and I stayed with him until he took his last breath and I finally admitted that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I only knew that for this I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the Home Crowd at an Olympic Games.
He also created a movement for his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which continued to resonate in his mind during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him stand out.
Desert Island Discus is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 British time.
McKenzie was added to the team's squad last week.
U.S. Phil McKinsey will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to restore his form to avoid setting an unpleasant milestone.
McKinsey, who is playing for the 12th time in a competition after every six months, has been added to the record by captain Jim Forrek for the Four Balls and Four Sims on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the people's eye, which he has often been for the United States, five-time major championship winner Michaelson spent his day playing the role of a chair leader and working on his game to overcome his weaknesses.
He could never throw a straight ball at the peak of his career, so the 48-year-old player is not fit for Lee Golf National's course, where his long hard-earned ground inflicts a severe punishment for the wrong shots.
And although the course on its own isn't that difficult, McKinsey will compete in the ninth match on Sunday with British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who along with Rocky Tommy Flatwood won all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, who are at a loss of four points at the start of 12 singles matches, start enthusiastically, McCulson's match can be really important.
Fiore expressed confidence in his player.
Furuk said he understands his role well today, slapped me on my back and put his arms around me and said that he would be ready for tomorrow.
He has complete confidence in himself.
He is popular and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't expect to play two games.
I had imagined more than that, but what was to happen happened and maybe we thought so.
Like every other player, he wants to be on the field.
He will play on Sunday and break the record for playing Nick Faldo's most-reader cup match.
This may be the end of his rider's cup career, but it has nothing to do with his individual record heights.
McCulson has achieved 18 times success, 20 times failure, and seven times equal scores, though Furuk said his presence gave him a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he is humorous, witty, cunning, likes to flirt with people and is the soul of the team room.
I think the kids are having a lot of fun with it this week.
There is a lot more to it than the game.
European captain Thomas Byron knows that the big lead may soon be over.
European captain Thomas Byrne knows from his experience that a fairly large lead can easily turn into trouble in the last day's singles matches of the Ryder Cup.
The Danish player began his career in Valderrama in 1997 with a team in the lead of Seo Bolsteros leading by five points over the Americans, but when they reached the finish line, they won by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 with a very narrow margin.
"You've been reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in the brook line, where we were defeated and we won in Valderrama, but with very little margin.
So the story told me and everyone else in the team that the matter is not over yet.
We are going to the field today with full preparation.
They go there and do everything right.
It doesn't end until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy and focus all our attention on it.
I have always said that I focus on 12 players on my side, but we are well aware that on the other hand we are competing with the best players in the world.
Happy with the performance of my players on a tough golf course, Byron added; I never rushed into it.
We'll have a different call tomorrow.
There will be individual performances tomorrow that will be prominent, and this is a different thing to do.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when the conditions are favorable, but when you're there alone, then your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is the message that you have to fully prepare the players and take advantage of their full potential.
Now you have to leave your partner behind and show him your full potential.
In contrast to Byron's, opponent number Jim Furuk expects his players to perform better individually than the pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who picked up three of the four points.
Fiorque himself remained at both ends of these unexpected big changes of the last day, being part of the winning team in the Brookline after he suffered a defeat when the European team won the "Cormacy of Medina".
When asked how he managed to get his players to the final day in 1999, he said, "I remember every word of it.
Tomorrow we'll have 12 main matches, but you'll want to get to that quick start, as you saw in the Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that amount of movement is on one side, she puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and keep our players in such a way that tomorrow we will show some kind of magic.
Thomas has been given the task of leading the counter-attack and will compete with Rory McLaroy in the top match and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Flatwood and Ian Polter and other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I put my players in this order because I think it covers the whole game.
Germany's new warship was deferred once again.
The German Navy's new frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era ships, but that won't happen until at least next year, according to local media.
A military spokesman said the commissioning of the first-ever ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, the "Rainland Falls," was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be inducted into the Navy in 2014, but the troubled issues of post-delivery have damaged the Oluwazam project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that these ships will have a powerful torpedo, a variety of aircraft skirmishes and naval skirmishes, as well as secret information-sharing technologies such as radar, infrared and sound devices.
Other important features include more long-lasting maintenance - it is possible to deploy the latest fragrances away from your home port for up to two years.
However, Die Zeit pointed out that the continued delays in these sophisticated warships would make them obsolete at the time of entry into service, which is said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength across the sea.
The less fortunate F125 frigate came in the headlines last year when the German Navy refused to officially commission the ship and sent it back to the Bloom & Wassup Yard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the ship has returned after delivery.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited "severe malfunctions of software and hardware" that would have made the warship ineffective if it were deployed on a Hurricane mission.
The defects of the software were particularly significant because the Baden-Württemberg class ships were to be operated by only 120 sailors - which is about half of the workforce on the old Bremen class ships.
It was also revealed that the ship's weight was too heavy, which undercuts its performance and limits its ability to add future upgrades to the fleet.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland Falls is twice the weight of the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to poor hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, has also become a problem.
Its cost is said to have risen from the initial 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion).
The importance of the problems faced by the new fragrances increases in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, the head of the defense committee of the German parliament, Hans Peter Batelz, acknowledged that the Navy was lacking ships capable of deploying.
The official said that the problem has become serious over time, as old ships have been discharged but new ones have not been delivered.
He regretted that no frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
Research on the Secret Life of the National Trust
The new research, conducted at a shelter in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how bats use natural landscapes to find food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these flying mammals in a unique way and provide guidance for future conservation activities.
Research studies conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland at the Inverness Gardens in Wester Ross include general and spranio-pipes trails, as well as brown-eared and dubbonton bats.
Special recorders will be placed at important places throughout the region to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will perform mobile surveys using manual detectors.
An expert voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls from bats and what types of calls are being made.
A map and report of the Zad Bom will then be prepared to give a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rab Devor, a natural conservation adviser for the NTS, expressed hope that the findings would show which areas of the zodiac are most important for bats and how they are used for all types of bats.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the Zad Boom's administrative work such as setting up a greenhouse for bats and related types and maintaining forests.
There has been a significant decline in bat populations across Scotland and the UK over the past century.
Their populations are threatened by construction and development work that affects their ashians and zodiac booms.
In addition to wind-powered turbines and lights, some chemical components of flypaper and building materials and attacks by pet cats are also a threat to them.
The squirrels aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch a prey.
She uses an aesthetic eco-location technique to detect insect bites and obstacles on her flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 37 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the ashians, and carry out relief operations.
The organization is Scotland's first and only refugee shelter in Dumfries and Thrave State in Galway, with eight in Scotland's ten bat species.
State manager David Thompson said the state was a better place for them.
He said that we have a wonderful place for bats here in Thrave.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good son-in-law boom.
But there are a lot of things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we're doing here or elsewhere will help us understand what needs to be done for their growth.
He stressed that it is important to locate bats before starting maintenance work in buildings as it is possible that destroying a maternity ward could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly a full local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, threaten or hurt them or destroy their prey.
The Scottish officer of the Battle Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We know a lot about bats, and for many species, we don't even know what their populations are.
Ronaldo's allegations of sexual assault have been denied, and lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the sexual abuse allegations against him “fake news” and said people want to use his name to make publicity.
His lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Katherine May-Urga, an American woman, has claimed that she was raped in 2009 by Portuguese-influenced Ronaldo at a hotel in Las Vegas.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Ronaldo was accused of paying Catherine $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Hours after the claim was reported, speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram Live Radio, 33-year-old Ronald Reagan dismissed the reports as ‘false news’.
He said, "No, no, no."
The winner of the five-time Ballon d'Or said to the camera, "What they're saying is false news."
They want to be known by my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's what happens in such actions.
He smiled and said, "I'm happy and everything is going well.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel in connection with the charges, which he described as "unacceptable reporting of suspicious things in the private life."
Cristiano Ronaldo will "claim damages in accordance with the serious nature of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years," said lawyer Christiane Shirtz.
The alleged incident took place in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and May Urga allegedly went back to Players Rome, where he allegedly sexually assaulted her via anus.
May Urga claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo sat down on his knees in front of him and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but "one percent evil" he has been defeated.
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that he had sex, but this was done by mutual consent.
Meyerga also claimed that she went to the police and also took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "fearless of retaliation" and was concerned by "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to end the settlement because she is in constant trauma due to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United and join Real Madrid, and has moved to Italian club Juve this summer with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'will always be sorry' for loss as carmakers
Business Secretary Greg Clarke said the UK would "always regret" if it lost its position as a global leader in the automotive sector after Brexit.
He added that it was "serious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK exits the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt its production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"Mr. Clark said we need a deal.
The Japanese automaker said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the jobs would be affected due to the impact of border delays.
The Burnstone plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnstone, said: "My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be productive breaks in our factory.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how to trade across borders.
For example, BMW says it will close its money plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Carsellers say most of the concerns in the case of a no-deal Brexit are related to the risks of the supply chain.
Toyota's production line runs on a 'buy-time supply' basis, under which parts from suppliers from both the UK and the EU will arrive every 37 minutes for on-order cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption on the border, which could delay or reduce the supply of parts.
The company says it will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant.
Mr Clark said the Chequers project for future relations with Theresa May's EU is "prepared to avoid these inspections on the border."
He told BBC Radio 4's 2-day programme, "We want a great deal that will help us succeed in the current situation, but take full advantage of this opportunity."
The testimony of not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we have to be able to fully sustain our highly successful supply chain.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned that long-term increases in costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately affect jobs.
Peter Sassours, who has been working in Bornastone for 24 years and is the United Union Convener at the plant, said he was "very upset" with it: "In my experience, these jobs never come back when they're over."
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a correct and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House said Sunday that Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be delayed by another week" while the conflict with Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Roussin is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump's dismissal of the deputy attorney general would jeopardize Mueller's sovereignty or not has been a topic of conversation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed using the device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House despite reports of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was present at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not prefer the expulsion of Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was witnessed by both Kevin and another woman, Dr. Christine Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation to investigate claims against Kevin, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it may be this week, among other things, I see that there will be a further delay of one week.
But we'll keep an eye on it and I'll always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters will reject this claim: Sanders has not made any press briefings at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
"Although the lack of briefings was not due to the disapproval of TJ reporters, I will not deny the fact that they understand that," Sanders said.
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without quoting, he said, "The president has the highest number of questions and answers than the previous president: we have seen their numbers."
"There will still be briefings, but if the press had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it would certainly be much better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We do our best to do this and you've seen us do it over the past few weeks and when you speak to the President of the United States, it will replace the press briefing.
Trump regularly asks questions when leaving the White House or attending a press conference with open sessions or dignitaries.
Solitary confinement is very rare.
This week in New York, the president probably stated the reason for the violation of the rules and sometimes the presence of a different kind of gathering in front of reporters.
The NHS has written a letter to EU workers about fears of Brexit in Scotland.
The health secretary has written to the staff working in the NHS in Scotland to thank the country for their support and wish to stay after Brexit.
The letter comes less than six months after the UK's exit from the European Union.
The Scottish government has pledged to meet the cost of settlement status requests for EU citizens already working in developed public services.
In his letter, Mr. Fremantle wrote: "There have been ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU in activities that are expected to be decided this fall.
But the UK government is also speeding up its preparations to deal with any possible unrest.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the role of each member regardless of the nationality of the staff.
The European Union and far-flung partners bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
"Scotland is your home and you want to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery.
Tennessee's Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie suffered a head injury during the match with Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday and then suffered an emergency surgery after losing 27-31.
The head coach of the state of Tennessee, Road Reed, told reporters that the injury took place some time before half-time.
"He came on one side and became unconscious there," Red said.
The trainers and medical staff turned to one side before putting Ebercromby on the stretcher and taking him back for further inspection.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Ebercrombie's surgery was carried out at the Wander Bullet Medical Center.
Harris added, "There are currently no details available on the nature/severity of the injury," and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a junior, is playing his first season with the state of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made a total of five tackles, which totaled 18 of his tackles in the season.
More stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers buying property in the UK.
More stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers buying property in the UK, with additional money to be used to help homeless people under the new Tory schemes.
This move will disable the success of attracting young voters of the Carbines Drive.
Stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects to receive <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that it has been decided to impose more stamp duty on foreigners buying property in the UK - with the additional money being used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as a boost to Jeremy Corbyn's campaign's success in providing more affordable home bars to young voters with the pledge and targeting more earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and entities who are not paying taxes in the UK, with the additional money to be used to promote the government's campaign against gold.
Surcharges, which are an increase in existing stamp duty, including high levels that were introduced two years ago when buying for other homes and rents - could be up to 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to earn <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
About 13% of new homes built in London are bought by non-British people and make it difficult for first-time home buyers to step up the ladder.
Many of the country's protected areas - especially in the capital - have become "beautiful towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just two weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of buying land and not using it to keep property prices high, and urged Ms. May to eliminate quotas on cheap homes to get rid of "household humiliation" in the UK.
Mr. Karbine has announced a series of attractive proposed reforms including Rent Controls and "Bana Kothari"
They also want to give councils more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "For the past year I have said that I will dedicate my job to the revival of the British dream - this life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing the market for our broken homes.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and live independently.
However, it may not be as convenient for those who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign companies to buy homes like hard-working British citizens.
For many people, owning a home has become just a dream, and the lack of sleep has become a reality."
Jack Russ: "My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland."
Sunderland owner Jack Russ says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Scott is going through the challenge of reviving the 42 North East club, which is still three points short of the first position in the league one.
He went to this summer's Stadium of Light after last season's St. Mirren took him to the Scottish Premiership.
"I want to play for my country.
I was given a B-cap and a bus," Russia told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But Scotland grew up looking at Hampden (Hampden) with his father, and that's what pulled me back.
But that's only possible if I'm successful."
As manager of Sunderland, Russia's frontrunners include Dick Advocat, David Moise, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poitt and Paulo de Canino.
The former boss of the Alloa Athletic says that after Barnsley and Ipswich Town rejected the advance, they had no fear of following such famous names in such a big club.
"Success at this point will be measured for me to say, 'Can I take this club back to the Premier League?'"
"In terms of the club's structure and facilities, of course, its place is in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'll consider myself successful here only if I can get the club back there."
Russia has just three years in its management career after spending 15 months as an assistant boss and coaching staff at Hearts in Dumbarton.
He then helped save Alva from going out to recover to third grade, and saved St. Mary's from going out the following year, making him one of the champion title winners.
And Russia says they feel more relaxed now than their playing careers in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkrock, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academics.
Recalling Alva's handling of the charge, he said, "It was a real mess.
"I think it's more important for me to play the game."
It sounds strange because I played well, earned a lot of name and money from it and also enjoyed a somewhat high standard of living.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things you need to do on a weekly basis.
As far as mental stress and stress is concerned, I still face them, but I think management is appropriate.
I've always wanted to be an administrator and now I'm doing it, as much as I've spent my childhood, I think it's more comfortable than the rest of my life.
You can listen to the entire interview on Sports Sound on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
A survey has revealed that the best time to drink a pint is 5:30.
The heat wave of the summer has increased the sales of British low-run pubs but has also increased the pressure on restaurants.
Statistics show that sales of pubs and bar groups grew by 2.7 percent in July - but its sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a statistical analyst, said: "Continuous sunshine and more long-term participation in the World Cup, unlike England's expectations, meant that the series was seen in June last month when sales of pubs rose by 2.8%, except for the fact that the restaurant sales were higher.
Restaurants' business declined by 1.8% in June and became even worse in July.
If compared to restaurant sales, as far as restaurant sales went down, pubs and bars running on alcohol have been successful so far.
Pubs running on food were also affected by the sun, but not as much as restaurant operators were affected.
Some people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of similarly managed pubs and bar beverages rose by 6.6% this month, while food sales fell by 3%.
Regional sales manager Paul Newman, an analyst for luxury and hospitality, said: "These results continue to reflect the trend we have seen since the end of April.
As far as sales in the outdoor market are concerned, the impact of the weather and important social or sporting events is the biggest factor.
Despite a year-on-year drop in sales of 4.8%, it is not surprising that restaurant groups are still facing difficulties and this will be especially distressing due to ongoing price pressures.
There was no worse time for the long hot summer to come for the operators running on food, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures seen in August will provide the necessary time-consuming rest.
The total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in trend towards brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker observes the industry sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's recognized benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, even under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a "central" account to show their parents.
One in five children - even young people aged 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a sharp increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a photo-sharing site with reference to Instagram.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of pupils said they have a clean "central" account to show parents, while also having private accounts.
A mother secretly looked at her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, revealing a young girl who was wanting others to "make more" with her.
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference of Autonomous Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which have admitted to maintaining their private accounts.
"It's troubling that so many young people are engaged in creating online accounts where their parents and teachers can't find them," said HMC chief Mike Beacon.
Eli Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eli Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member during the Annual General Meeting of Administrative Affairs in Scottish Athletics.
Duel holds the most outstanding track record in Scotland and sees the move as a great opportunity for sports leaders who want to take advantage of their internationally-funded experience over the past decade.
"Aly has great respect for the Scottish, British and world-wide athletics community and we are confident that her boarding will be useful for athletics in Scotland," he said.
"I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to help and play my part in guiding the sport in Scotland," he said.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m races with his other four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a temporary stroke attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
It was a very patient job but I have fully recovered and learned how to walk again, and today I am doing walking exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
The ad of the breast pump, in which the mothers were compared to buffaloes, has shared the feedback online
The ad of a breast pump company shared online feedback that was similar to a cow feeding nursing mothers.
To mark the launch of the "World's First Wearable Silent Breast Pump," consumer technology company Elvie has launched a music video ad to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing on a fence full of buffaloes on a song that includes the following words: "Yes, I'm milking my own milk, but you won't see a tail" and "And if you don't think about it, it's not my tail."
The song continues: "Take her out, take her out, I'm feeding the children, take her out, take her out, I'm milking the women."
However, the ad that appeared on the Facebook page has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, often saying it is highlighting the "bad effects" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use buffaloes to advertise this product.
"Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to babies, except their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth," a woman wrote.

Another commented: "Of course it is painful for the child and the mother.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who have their own children?"
Someone else said, "It's a very sad story."
Others defended the ad, including a woman admitting that she found the song "fun".
"I think it's a sexual act.
If I could still drink milk, I would buy it.
It makes me feel like a cow.
It's a bit crazy, but it's what I'm looking for.
One person said, "It's a good product."
Another commented: "It's a humorous ad that targets mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and makes them feel like their own "cow."
This ad is not about defining the dairy industry or forming an opinion about it.
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that she was dancing with a pump in her brewer.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who pump their breasts feel like cows.
However, the Elvis pump is absolutely noisy, has no wires and fits carefully inside the nursing brazier, which also enables women to move, hold their baby, and go out while pumping.
Partner in Mother (Mother) and ECD Anna Blarne commented: "The ELV pump is such a revolutionary product that it needed a fearless and active launch.
By keeping the women and Dairy buffaloes parallel, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while by expressing it in a fun and relevant way, we wanted to create the glorious sense of freedom that this new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvis has come to the red carpet.
In London Fashion Week, the mother of two children wore this product and came on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the monthly crossing rate has remained relatively the same, partly due to the Trump administration's policies and narratives that have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear that their own ability to claim a child could be at risk.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adult members of their family would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albinus, a senior official working in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor low-income children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no past criminal record.
"Around 80 percent of these people are illegal settlers in the country who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
So, we will investigate these infertility," Mr. Albens said.
Aspiring to process children quickly, authorities are introducing new laws that would require some of them to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days of detention, which was a previous standard.
Many of them will be presented to the immigration judge via video conference call instead of presenting themselves to pursue a legal case.
Those deemed ineligible for release will be deported immediately.
According to reports from asylum-seekers and systems in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be disturbed or distressed, which can lead to violent protests or attempts to freeze.
The lawyers said the protections are even more prevalent in larger centres such as the Tornado, where children are more likely to ignore such symptoms because of the large volume.
He added that moving to Tent City without giving the children enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying goodbye to friends could lead to a shock that already has enough children suffering.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “Occupational Forces” to leave immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mahlam also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
The teacher, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly."
He said: "They need to be removed immediately.
The teacher insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people dead and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy war against both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence" until we free all Syrian territories from them."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arab and Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 ground troops in France's war-torn country.
On the issue of Syrian refugees, the teacher said the conditions for their return were reasonable and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that led to refugees staying away.
"We have sought help from the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
"They're politicizing the thing that should be based on humanity as a whole."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until an agreement is reached between the opposition and Bashar al-Assad to end the war.
U.S. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the last central rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity for further pressure for political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has halted the attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
The teacher, however, stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which would be "endangered."
U.S. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is expected to soon hold a meeting of the new committee, which includes government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
The teacher explained the Syrian government's conditions for joining the committee, saying the panel's work should be "limited to the review of the current constitution" and should refrain from interference.
Why Trump will win the second term.
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if accounts and scandals cancel his presidency in advance, as many liberals hope.
This will be the "most dramatic final" of the series.
So far, there are no signs of anxiety.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC has doubled to 1.6 million.
According to Nelson, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has secured the first position in cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers in Central News Nights.
A cabinet secretary, who becomes president after an attack and later destroys the Capitol, said the ABC's drama "Designated Survivor" show ran "This is a fire that people are going to burn because it's not something we understand."

Of course, apart from anything on television, the story from Washington's Roe v. Wade, whether refugee families can regroup and determine the future of the health of the global economy.
Not paying attention is a luxury and only the most deserving viewers can afford it.
And yet, it gets beyond being an informed citizen when you use a six-hour panel of experts for Bob Woodward's book "Fear" on the "Deep Background" of his own, Paul Manafort's $15,000-square-square-footed leather bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post, "Trump's T-shirts and T-shirts").
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario as one of them.

When I reached Mr. Flyes this month, the weather was warm up to 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Koi, but he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN sitting inside the house.
They couldn't keep themselves away, and not at all when Brett Kavanaugh has to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court is on that balance.
Mr. Flyes told me, "I remember when we had a great show all day and people used to say, 'These are the beginnings of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was kind of funny, but it turned out they were telling the truth."

There is a lot of money going into the middle-term for Evan's career.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th election is witnessing an outflow of money, thanks to the re-alignment of the congressional districts, which has led to two new candidates for the same seat.
It recently won the Pittsburgh Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, a semi-provincial, who won a special election in another district last spring.
Limbs are competing with another Republican Representative Keith Rothfuss, who is still representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which is quite dominant as the new 17th district.
Maps were rebuilt after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally closed to benefit Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a financial battle between the party's financial aides, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Limbaugh has become a known name in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been owned by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won from the district with 20 points.
Political pundits have given a slight edge to the Democrats.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for its support to China and then back it up.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing after some pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama even as his partner ousted the Trump organization's management team.
Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials decided to call the U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "as a result of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan."
But the sentences were only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in funding and targeted visa restrictions, could be painful for the Central American country and its rising unemployment and murder rates.
As progress progressed in internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a major step forward in last year's gathering efforts to prevent refugees from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top management officials made it clear that they wanted advances in the conference that effectively eliminated any penalty protections for El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is being criticized for addressing a conference in mid-October as a symbol of a change in administrative positions at the gathering.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or punishments from the United States.
A White House representative for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who were willing to discuss internal debate on the condition of anonymity.
His accounts were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and he also spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The path of history depends on such altering points, and the inevitable journey of democracy is swift or delayed on the basis of that.
The U.S. is now faced with a number of challenges.
If Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, what would we do, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Ever since the newspaper reported that Mr. Rosenstein proposed a secret recording of the president and indicated he was unfit for office, he has been in trouble.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is wrong.
"If the investigation of the newly requested F.B.I.'s Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if the Supreme Court confirms it despite solid evidence of sexual assault and false testimony?"
And above all, what if we vote for Congress in the midterms that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will suffer from a long, hard winter.
But because of the lessons I learned in Prague, I am confident that we will not fail.

Rangers' Graham Dorsey is looking forward to competing against Rapid Vienna (Rapid Vienna).
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that despite a victory against Austria and a draw against Valerial in Spain earlier this month, they will keep them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
The injury on the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dornes from presenting his first game in the season, even with a 2-2 draw from Villarreal, but he is confident Rangers can use the result as a springboard for future excellent results.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team.
We went to the match with the belief that we could get something and we got a point.
Maybe we could have made it final at the end, but overall the fear was a reasonable result.
They were probably better in the first half and we proved to be better and relatively better competitors in the second half.
It's another big game on Sunday.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough match because they have got a good result in their last match but since fans support will be with us, I hope we can go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough and whatever happened with my injuries and changes to the club, but now I have a good feeling about the place.
The squad is good and the players are really enjoying it; training is also very good.
Hopefully, we can move forward, and succeed by putting the previous season behind us.
Women can't sleep on their own.
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear about how they should be taken care of, very few were talking to their family members about it.
Nearly half of those surveyed said they had been discussing long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member who takes care of them, but they're not taking steps to discuss it," said Holly Sander, vice president of the country-wide life insurance business.
We have to start from here.
Talk to your children and spouse: If you do not inform your family about your wishes ahead of time, you may not be able to provide care to your family.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss how to receive care, as these options can be a prominent factor in cost-determination.
Bring your financial advisor in front of you: Your advisor can also help you bring out the payment methods for these expenses.
Your funds' resources for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to cover these expenses, or personal insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have money.
Take out your legal documents: Stop the legal battles.
Get health care support so that you can hand over your medical care oversight to a trusted person and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
In addition, take into account the power of assigning decisions to your financial affairs.
If you are disabled, you will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
Rescuers from the Dong-Gala area, which is located north of Palo, have not received any reports of a 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the storm struck.
Below are some of the basic information about Palo and Dong gala, located on the island of Slovenia:
Palo is the capital of the central Sulawesi province on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami came, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dong Gala Island covers an area of more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) northwest of Slovenia.
The province of Regency is an administrative region with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the central Sulawesi province is mainly dependent on fishing and farming, especially the coastal area of Dong-Gala.
Nickel mining is also an important part of the province, but it is mostly concentrated in the opposite coastal area of Sulawesi to the point of Moro Wiley.
According to the Indonesian storm mitigation agency, Palo and Dong Gala have been hit by the tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dong-Gala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western Dong-Gala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are as follows:
2004: The December 26 tsunami in Indonesia's northern Sumatra province triggered another tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, killing more than half of them in Asia.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nyas off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, creating a tsunami that later hit the south coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10-metre-high waves that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild-magnitude earthquake hit the region of Pedaja in Asia, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died as a result of falling buildings.
2018: A major earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists were temporarily in fear.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trek Paulin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for attacking.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she snatched her phone from him.
KTUU has reported that Palin has been remanded to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and detained on an unsecured bond of $500.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, and when he was asked about his plea, he declared himself "not guilty."
Palin faces three levels of A deficiencies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also accused of level B deficiencies, with a one-day sentence in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been levelled against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, molestation of a domestic violence report, and possession of weapons related to the incident.
His girlfriend had accused him of punching him in the face.
In 2016, former military groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which grew after his services in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Videos of the earthquake are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for the Palo City Maine beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York have called for the death penalty against the suspect in the terrorist attacks in New York, Saifulu Saipoo, who killed eight people -- a rare death sentence that has not been pronounced against a federal crime in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Seppou reportedly used a rental truck of the home depot to attack the cyclist's route along the western side of the highway in Lower Manhattan, and crushed pedestrians and cyclists on their way.
As a justification for the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Seppo "intentionally" targeted eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the warning notice for seeking the death penalty listed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court documents, both of these crimes are punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Sipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of systematic exploitation for the murder of Baljbar, commonly used by federal prosecutors in systematic crimes, and one charge of torture and destruction of vehicles.
Prosecutors described the attack as "shocking, brutal and thought-provoking," saying the attack required "a lot of planning and thinking."
The warning notice reads, "Sifulu Habibullah Eoch Sepoo by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clios, Ann Laure Dekat, Darren Derek, Ariel Earleigh, Harenn Ferrucci, Diego Mendoza and Elegant Damian Chowdhu's family of friends."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the death penalty has been imposed in the southern district of New York.
The defendant, Khaled Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a federal trial in New York executed a death sentence was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found to be plotting to spy for the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War, and were later sentenced to death.
Both Rosenbergs died by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Seppou, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not express any regrets in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the allegations, Seppou told authorities that he was affected by watching ISIS videos on his phone for the attack.
Police said he also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
22 He has pleaded guilty to the charges.
David Pattin, a federal public prosecutor representing Seppou, said the prosecutor's decision "was really disappointing."
"We think that seeking a death penalty would be a longer-term trauma for everyone involved in the incident than life imprisonment, which is unlikely to be released," he said.
Seppou's defense team had earlier asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
Tory's member assembly has said that Nigel Farage should be made in-charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage indicated to ‘mobilise the public army’ during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former UCIP leader said the politicians were "infuriated" by opposition from the European Union - when one of his members of the Theresa May Assembly suggested it should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union itself.
Conservative Peter Bonn, who was sitting in the back seat, told the March in Birmingham that had Ferrag been Brexit secretary, Britain would have "exited the EU" by now.
But Ms May has difficulty persuading members of her various positions, which are being highlighted by her opponents in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
Despite Brexit supporters, opponents and attacks by the European Union, the prime minister is trying to keep his checkers marketing plan in the right direction.
The Allies insisted that they would try to advance a deal with Germany despite strong reactions - and would force EU opponents and workers to choose from their package and ‘conflicts'.
Mr. Bonn said that leaving means Leo Rally in Solly Hill, through which she wants to ‘force the checkers’.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been involved and held responsible for negotiations with Germany.
He said: “If they were in charge, Britain would have left the European Union by now.
Wellingborough's member assembly added: "I'm a supporter of Brexit but we have to force the checkers."
Talking about his opposition to the EU, he said: “We do not fight world wars to be defeated.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is absolutely wrong.”
Anti-Brexit tour leader Andre Jenkins was also present at the march and told reporters: “I just say: Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Checkers are unpopular in the general public and the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and our workers who fill the streets elect us.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please
In a special message to Ms. May, she said: “The Prime Ministers remain so long as they keep their promises.”
Shri Ferraj told the rally that if politicians are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they will have to “feel sorry and angry”.
He said: "It's a matter of trust between our people and our political class.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit, and we are here today to tell you that ‘we will not allow you to do this’.”
In a message to the enthusiast, he said: “I want to make my political class feel sad and angry who are on the brink of betrayal from Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has brought us success in Brexit and we will not sit down with China until we know we are autonomous, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A small number of activists oppose Tory Brexit on the group's launch this week to lift the banners.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives on security issues, which he encountered with the party's app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT system for uninterrupted border and free trade in Ireland and the entire technology and everything for Canada.”
"It's a full-fledged search.
There is nothing better than Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to "deeply consider" the president's election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "focus" on contesting for president after the November election.
According to a Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat leader spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she may face Trump in 2020.
Ever since Trump took office, using the Town Hall format, he had his 36th meeting with the Constitutionalists on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood.
One of the attendees asked if she planned to contest the president's election.
So Warren replied, "It's time to go to Washington to fix our broken government system, and that includes high-ranking women."
Sams of LSU has been arrested in connection with the shooting death.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that the arrest of 20-year-old Dieton Simpson took place at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They have released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man has been identified who is calling for help.
20-year-old Sam was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media at 247sports on Saturday, "Wide Sims was shot in the head and eventually died."
Wade came forward to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present with the weapon on the spot and also admitted to shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
In Baton Rouge, a 6-foot 6-inch-tall owner, Sims, played 10 times as a first-time player in 32 games last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Team Orders came closer to world honours after Lewis Hamilton's victory against Substitute Vettel.
It was at that moment that it became clear that Waltery Bottas had qualified before Lewis Hamilton that the Mercedes team would play a big role in the Orders Race.
From Poole, Bottas made a good start and almost took Hamilton ahead of him while defending his position during the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack against his teammate.
Vettel went into the first pits and pushed Hamilton into the traffic on the back of the pack which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later completed the lip and came behind Vital, but at the same time, Hamilton went ahead in the race when the driver of the escape hesitated, risking the insider's side by walking the dual trick in defense of the third corner.
On the occasion of his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh position by the end of the first lap.
Then he advanced to the larger part of the race when he held his tires up for an immediate end and trailed the reduction Rykonen for the fourth position.
He eventually got into the Pitts in the 44th lip, but during the remaining eight lipsticks he failed to increase his speed when Reaconin took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Waltery did a fantastic job throughout the week and was a really good man who let go.
"The team has done a fantastic job of maintaining the first two positions," Hamilton said.
These were very bad physical signs.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dean Finstein's insistence on Saturday at a rally that he did not disclose the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court-appointed representative Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony before Ford's Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "stupid, grumpy and liar."
"One thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days is that when you see anger, you see mean, disgusting and liars," he said.
"When you see things going on and revealing, and then say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do that."
Do you remember?
Dean Finestein, did you find out?
Remember the answer... did you reveal the document - "Oh, what?"
Oh no.
I didn't whine."
Okay, wait a minute.
He added: "We're not going to do anything about it, we're not going to do anything about it.
Finstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kevin in July by Ford, and it was revealed in early September - however Finstein denied that it was revealed from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Finnstein told the committee, according to Hill's report.
"They told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret."
But their denial was not correct according to the president who commented on it during Saturday's rally: "Let me tell you that it was extremely bad manners.
It may not be the best, but it's the worst I've ever seen."
Defending his representative for the Supreme Court, to whom three women have been accused of sexual misconduct, the president suggested Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
"They are determined to take back power in all circumstances.
"You're watching their commotion, ghetto, they don't care who they hurt, they have to crush for power and control," the mediate reported.
Elite League (Elite League): Dundee Stars (Dundee Stars) 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duarte scored two goals against Dundee for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars played a 3-5 win over the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
Giants took the lead through the first two shots of Patrick Doyer and Francis Beauvoir.
Mike Sloan and Jordan Cowney equalled the home side before Dwayne regained the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee and later Lucas Lindwald Nelson's goals ensured their victory.
This is the third defeat of the season for Adam Cafe's players in the Elite League, who came up from a weak spot to beat Dundee 1-2 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams in which the Giants won the last three matches.
Doyer's first goal came through Kendall McFaul's assist at 3:35 in the fourth minute, while Beauvaillier provided the assist when the first doubled 4 minutes later.
Although it was a busy start-up period, Matt Marquette's second goal at 15:16 brought Sloan home side back into the game at 13:10.
Doyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first break.
The home side gathered again and again came to par with a power play goal at 27:37.
Kawni and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen together to lead Dundee for the first time shortly before the second break in the match, and he secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the final break.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are home in Milton Keynes to play their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers gave their lives to ensure that hundreds of people on board survived the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero who lost his life by ensuring that a ship full of hundreds of people flew safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have been killed and several are missing in a major earthquake that triggered a tsunami in Soleimani on Friday.
The strong tremors following the earthquake have spread to the area and many people are buried under the rubble in the city of Palo.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save his own life, a 21-year-old Anthony Gonnon Agung refused to leave his post at the Severe Swing Control Tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 took off safely, which was on the runway at the time.
When he realized that the traffic control tower was falling, he jumped out of the tower.
He later died at the hospital.
Australia's ABC News reported that Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sereit said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We developed a helicopter in Kali Mantan to take it from Balkpain to another city big hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo Alto.
He added: "We are deeply saddened to hear this.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the country's disaster response agency says access to DongGala, Sigi and Botong is limited.
"It is suspected that the death toll is rising because many people were buried under the debris and many were unable to reach them," the agency's spokesman, Stepo Provo Nagorno-Karabakh, said.
Waves reaching 6 metres have destroyed Palo where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial vessels are bringing aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kassoma, told Sky News: "Every moment an ambulance takes a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Smaller markets are being re-launched."
John Galfande, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working at great speed to help survivors, but we don't know what they will get there.
There has already been an accident, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to devote day and night to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" the CNN report.
This year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crashes: Air New Guinea says a man is missing after the plane crashed
The airline, which operates a cruise flight in the Pacific Logon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, while earlier the airline said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking ship.
Air New Guinea said in a release that by Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the lives of other passengers and crew after the plane collided with water in an attempt to land at Chuckland Airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers remained in the hospital and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy, said the plane landed in Logan, some distance from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had gone ahead of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jennings said the plane had come down a lot.
"It's a very good thing," said Jens.
Jeens said he and the other passengers on board the sinking ship went through an emergency exit route and stayed in deep waters up to the waist.
He said the flight attendants were worried and were running, and that he also suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve the nearest port before the ship sank about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water also helped with rescue operations by bringing people from the water to the shore through a floating boat.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airlines' plane crashes, while those did not include Air New Guinea.
Investigators gave the timeline of the night the woman was cremated alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday completed their arguments in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cell phone records from the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Teles, and the targeted 19-year-old Jessica Chambers to collect the night of his death, the movements and scuffles.
Clarion Ledger said Raulette received location data from a number of cell phones showing that Teles was with Chambers on the evening of his death, which is in conflict with his previous claims.
When the data showed that his phone was in the chambers during that time, Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Teles was telling the truth that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was lying "because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Teles said he had known him for two weeks when Chambers died.
Cell phone records indicate that they have known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted the Chamber's messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He said, "He saved my life."
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop group of three people wants to challenge the negative perception about this type of music by adding positive messages to their music.
The High Bread from Bristol claimed that Hip Hop has deviated from its original purpose of correcting political messages and social issues.
They want to take it to its original and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Fans such as Fugees and Common have seen a recent reception in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lucy.
There's another black hole?
Nanny, from New York, filed a lawsuit against the couple after they were fired on a "racist" message.
A message sent by a New York-based babysitter's mother, complaining that she was "another black person," is being filed for discriminatory eviction by the couple.
The couple denied that they were racist and expressed the possibility that the trial was intended to receive "tawan."
Lance Plasco Flexman, who is the mother of two children, expressed disappointment over the arrival of the baby's new care provider Giselle Maris on the first day in 2016 that she was black.
Mrs. Plasco Felixman sent a message to her husband, "No, another black one."
Instead of sending her husband, however, she sent Mrs. Maris twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his mistake, the "disturbed" Plasco Flexman expelled the African-American nanny, Miss Maris, saying she was not doing her job properly and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Maris was paid one of her day's wages and then sent home via Uber.
Marius is now suing the couple for compensation for the extradition, and is seeking compensation of up to $350 per day for the same work for six months for which they were recruited without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple denied the allegation of racism, saying it was a reasonable job to remove Maris from the job because they couldn't trust her by angering her.
"My wife sent him something that he didn't intend to say.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
Do you want your child to be able to relate to someone you've met, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Try to understand."
Describing the case as "tavaan," Plasco said his wife is going to be a mother to the child two months later and is "suffering from a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to follow someone?"
This is not a commendable act," said the investor banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has been quick to take the couple's hand on social media and criticize their behavior and logic.
In a new letter, it has been revealed that Peddington publishers fear that readers will not match themselves to the speaking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It is difficult for the first-time reader to feel himself in someone else's place before it is published.
It's good to know what's behind Peddington's spectacular success.
Talking about his father, who has worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book about a toy bear, he said he was quite optimistic about his book being rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "suffering enough but sweet."
Talking about Paddington, which she calls a very important member of her family, she added that her father was extremely proud of her ultimate success.
He said: "He was a quiet man and not a boaster.
"But since Paddington was so real to them, it's just as if you have a child and they succeed: you're proud of them even if it's not your achievement.
I think they saw Paddington's success as something like this.
Although it was their creation and imagination, they always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
After landing, his daughter was immediately taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Ned was regularly calling to tell me that his condition was very bad and not expected to be saved," Ms. Edwin Leprosy said.
"Then I received a call from Ned that he would die in the next one or two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so much.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications given to her to keep her heart pumping were gradually losing its effect and getting out of her system.
He died a few years ago, and now it's all over.
I just had to sit there and watch it happen.
I couldn't cry, I was at home with people and family.
I really had to keep up."
Eventually, Mrs. Edwin Leprosy, who was five years old at the time of her daughter's death, boarded the plane with other passengers - who were unharmed by the grief they endured.
He said, "Nobody knows."
"My head was shaking and my eyes were shaking all the time."
It's hard to explain, but it happened during the flight when I had intense emotional sympathy for Ned.
He needs to understand and love me.
I knew how much he loved her."
Pregnant women post cards to stop suicide on bridges.
Two women, who lost their loved ones to suicide, are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting cards with impressive messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, on which people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when she became depressed and killed herself at the age of 18.
She said: "I don't want my parents to feel the same way I feel every day.
Miss Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a handsome chef with an impressive smile.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
He always said that his smile can brighten up any room.
However, before he died, he left work because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I'm always worried that this could have an impact.
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to bring people to the knowledge that there are people in the world with whom you can go and talk, even if they are friends."
"Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Humphries, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for years, lost her matrimonial partner Mark for 15 years shortly after her mother's death.
"He never said he was depressed or upset or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we felt a change in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them or do anything else."
He said that his death was a major shock for them, but they had to go through it: "It creates a void in the family.
It breaks us.
We all have to fight against it."

Brett Kavanaugh's future swings in the middle after the FBI's investigation begins
Speaking on Saturday, Mr. Flake said, "I thought we could really do something like what he's saying - an investigation that has limited scope and time - maybe we can build some alliances about it," and added that he feared the committee would be "distributed" due to biased grouping.
Why doesn't Mr. Kevana and his Republican supporters want an investigation by the FBI?
It's only because of their time.
The midterm elections on November 6 are just five weeks away - if the Republicans lose badly as expected, they will be extremely vulnerable in their efforts to elect a representative in the country's highest judiciary.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators and trying to form a nexus to support Kevin, who has been working for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through them he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI comes out?
In the Senate, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will enable Vice President Mike Pence to break the stalemate and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of deaths from North Korea has decreased.
A South Korean lawmaker has said the number of North Korean dissidents has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beung Seong, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 dissidents last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and high tariffs by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
A large number of North Korean dissidents have been granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is much easier to cross than a very safe non-combat zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the dissidents to be more illegal immigrants than refugees and often sends them back using force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still in a state of war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at advancing stalled talks to reduce nuclear weapons.
The meeting came after US President Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic summit in Singapore in June, when they agreed on broader terms to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ryong Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for slowing growth since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can first unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh a "hijaan" victim, and added that he is ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Representative Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "victim of hijacking" and said he was temporarily ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
Pelosi responded to Kevan's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, saying, "I can't do anything, but I think if a woman does something like this, she'll call it a "hijab."
Kevina emotionally denied the allegations that she sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, when they were both young.
At the beginning of his statement, Kevina was extremely emotional and sometimes went on and panicked while talking about his family and high school years.
He criticised the committee's Democratic representatives for openly calling the allegations a "ridiculous and coordinated attack on the role" developed by the Liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Cavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it proved he was biased against Democrats.
"I think they have disqualified themselves in the manner of such statements and criticism of Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When Pelosi was asked if she would try to impeach him if Kevana was confirmed, and the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, they acted on it from the back.
"I would say -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not eligible to be in the Supreme Court, but also the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kevin is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about a possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade of Kenya because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kiwana deferred questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time for Hezbollah to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that surprising?'"
Women need to control it.
It's a sad truth that months and years go by and that they can't get rid of it without crying.
"Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later, 'We cry when we're angry.'
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
She continued, "A woman who was in an executive position somewhere helped me a lot, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but acquired a skill that meant that when she was angry, she started crying, telling the person she was talking to, "Maybe you can make me cry.
But then I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was awesome.
Tears are allowed to partially outgrow anger because they have been fundamentally misunderstood.
There's an excellent memory of early employment in a men's-dominated office, where I found myself crying with unspeakable anger when I was caught by a big woman holding my neck - a serene manager with whom I had always been somewhat intimidated - and she pushed me towards the edge of the cliff.
He told me, "Don't let others see you cry."
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're depressed and will be happy that they overcame you.
Patricia Schröder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart during their election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found involved in an unmarried lover on a boat called a mini-business and he ran out of the race, Mrs. Schröder became deeply depressed and there was no reason why she did not want to run for the presidency herself.
Thirty years later, he told me with a laugh, "It wasn't a thought-provoking decision."
"There were already seven other candidates in this race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seven Bones."
Because the campaign was too late and she was too far behind in fundraising, and so she vowed she would not join the race until she raised $2 million.
It was a bitter war.
They found that some of their supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give them only $250.
He asked me, "Do you think I'm being rude?"
When he made his speech announcing that he would not start a formal campaign, he was deeply concerned by the emotions, thanks to the people who supported him, the system that caused so much trouble in raising funds and targeting votes instead of delegates, and was so overwhelmed by the feeling of sexual thought that he was traumatized.
Recalling the reaction of the press, Ms. Schroeder said, "You must have felt like I was going to have a nervous breakdown."
"You may have noticed that Clinix was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what I'm going to write about in my book.
"Are they crying?"
How will the U.S.-China trade war be beneficial to China?
According to experts, the opening doors of the trade war between the US and China were loud and as the war is not over, the rift between the two countries could be useful for China.
U.S. President Donald Trump has issued his first warning this year of taxing major Chinese exporters of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week when new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods came into force, imposing tariffs on nearly half of the goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded every time it imposes a five to 10 percent tariff on the most recent $60 billion in US goods.
China has indicated a shot at the US, and the world's second-largest economy does not appear to be weakening at the moment.
Forcing the U.S. to return to the U.S. means acknowledging its demands, but publicly submitting to the U.S. would be quite embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts still say that China can keep its seals going well, reducing the pressure of the US trade war could have a positive impact on China by reducing the two countries' dependence on each other in the long term.
Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Center for New American Security's Asia-focused think tank, said, "The fact that either the United States or China's immediate political decision can create a situation that can create economic hardship for either of the two countries and is more dangerous than it has ever been recognized by observers."
The foreign minister said Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees.
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and calls for the rebuilding of the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mullam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The ground situation today is more stable and safer with the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rehabilitating areas destroyed by terrorists to normalize the situation.
The refugees now have all the conditions to voluntarily return to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that damaged their homes and businesses.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Malik said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or support from countries that contributed to the coup.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
In the 2018 Rider Cup in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France, the European team defeated the US team by a final score of 16.5 against 10.5.
The United States has now beaten the European continent six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the honour when Danish captain Thomas Beveren's team reached 14.5 points they needed to beat the US team.
American star Phil McKinsey, who suffered much of the tournament's trouble, threw his T-shot in the water in the 3rd, 16th hole, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was successful in all his rounds and joined the 4 players who have scored 5-0-0 since the formation of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American player Jared Spyth was defeated by European team's lowest-ranked player Thor Bjorn Olsen by 5 and 4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson was defeated by England's Ain Polter 2 and 1, who may be playing his last Rider Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who participated in the eight Ryder Cups, became the most-winning European player of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't cry, but I can't cry today.
It has been a difficult year.
So, thank you to Thomas for choosing me and keeping my trust.
I'm happy to win the cup.
It's all about the team and I'm very happy that I was able to play my part," Garcia said after the European victory.
He moved the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a game on Sunday.
The 23-year-old said: "I'm proud to beat Tiger Woods.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now holds the record for the 13-21-3 Career Rider Cup.
Players among the greatest players of all time are odd figures who have won all the major 14 awards after Jack Nicklaus.
In addition to high-quality golfers Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fanao, the U.S. team struggled to find ease throughout the week.
U.S. captain Jim Forek said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these players, they tried."
This morning was a time when we put some pressure on European players.
But we failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 teams played a good game.
We will be back together, I will work with the American PGA and our Rider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to be appreciative.
We had a good game."
Red Wave Update: Concentrations Decreased in Panama, Montreal and Sarasota
The latest reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission show a general decline in red wave concentrations in parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, conditions such as the Pichi Bloom have been reported in the areas of Pennsylvania, Manatee, Sarasota, Shalit and Collier counties - indicating a decrease in concentration.
A red wave of an entire Jubain stretches from the coast of the northern peninsula to the southern Lee counties for an estimated 130 miles.
Pitch Hills is 10 miles off the coast of Borough County, but can be seen in less places than last week.
The red wave has also been seen in Pasco County.
Average concentrations in or near the coast last week in Penelope County, near the coast of Hillsborough County, backgrounds in Manatee County, backgrounds in Sara Suta County, backgrounds in Quetzalcoatl, backgrounds in Shalit County, and more concentrations in Le Caucasus.
Respiratory problems are still ongoing in the counties of Pennils, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Last week, there were no reports of respiratory problems in Northwest Florida.
