The combined incidence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar patterns in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, confirming that although phases vary from country to country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals, and intensive care centers should increase their preparedness for the rapidly growing number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care and especially ultra-sensory treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cell biology were found in Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested a new coronavirus as a pathogenic means, now called the acute acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) because of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
So far, evidence has shown that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e., respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while in the remaining 6%, it is a serious disease that requires deep medical attention.
The fatality rate of patients admitted to hospitals due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated the nature of the combined incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with the Hubei province of China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with cases in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and the EU
After China, there was a further geographic spread of COVID-19 and the rest of the world's COVID-19 pandemic figures are now following the situation in this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The publication of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al., on March 5 suggested the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the WHO.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases returned from Wuhan in China's Hubei province on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths including on 31 December 2019 and that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.
Gaining aggregate number of COVID-19 cases and aggregate cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases in every country around the world, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 a.m. using official sources such as the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO.
This data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the scope of the active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases for 14 days, for which the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK was considered during the period 1st January - 15th March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 am on 15th March 2020 and compared them with cases in Italy during 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the UK and the EU
The cumulative nature of the 14-day spread of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is similar to that in Hubei Province (China).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, and then began to increase rapidly until February 28, 2020.
This included predominantly the fastest-growing reported cases in Italy, but similar cases of COVID-19 were seen in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK (Supplementary Content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to cases in Italy during 31 January-15 March 2020.
It highlights that the number of cases in Italy was already reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK within a period of 3 weeks or less at 8 a.m. on March 15.
Our results show that the cases of COVID-19 are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The nature observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is growing at a comparatively fast pace in all countries.
Apart from this, while different countries are at different stages, the gap between national public health responses and the possible interpretation of different cases between countries and different protocols of patient selection are required to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a condition in which hypertension therapy is needed for 10% of patients affected by COVID-19, and media sources have indicated that the hospitals and hypertension medical centers in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data for admission to COVID-19 patients in hospitals and/or hypertension medical centers is currently only available for 6% and 1% of cases at EU/EEA levels respectively (data is not shown).
However, they need to compile the current monitoring data in a systematic manner consistent with that would focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 found that the number of hypertensive medical and mid-medical beds in Europe is very different, which is 29.2 beds in Germany per 100,000 population and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have less or more resources than Italy (laying 12.5 hypertension therapy and moderate therapy per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases reported in hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK is a sample situation related to the saturation of health care capacity is associated with a >90% risk of overcrowding of intensive care bed capacity, which is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
Since the cases are still confined to certain regions of the EU/EEA country and the UK, and since hospitals and intensive care centers are providing treatment to a certain regional population, the information of cases and hypertension treatment centers should be made available within the definition of regional centers for statistical 2 (NUTS-2) levels.
Italy's experience and current patterns in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and critical care centres must prepare themselves for the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for the growing number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care and especially critical care, such as the situation that has arisen in the affected regions of Italy.
A fast, proactive and inclusive approach is required to navigate rather than prevent delays in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as indicated in a recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, because if not implemented in a timely manner, the rapid expected increase in such cases will not afford the decision-makers and hospitals the opportunity to assess, accept and assimilate their response.
Public health measures have also been listed in the Rapid Risk Assessment to eradicate the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can further increase their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If it fails, there is a possibility that the health care systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a wave of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been attributed to the severe severe respiratory disease (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere and infected more than 80,000 people and has become a disaster for mankind.
Like the SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to contract SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been infected with bats and exhibit similar symptoms through a similar technique.
However, the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, but the infection rate is higher and it is more common in older men and women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and inclusive review of the research topic that is developing.
We have dealt with the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 was an unprecedented and unforgettable one for all Chinese people who were asked to stay at home throughout the holidays and for several weeks after the outbreak of a new infectious disease.
The virus is very homogenous with the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003, so on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization renamed it SARS-CoV-2 and allied disease as COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged and 3,000 deaths.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is the "enemy of the people number one" and possibly even more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 research papers have been published on COVID-19 which includes its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of patients diagnosed with various ailments since the first case was reported on 7th January 2020.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in new and slowly evolving subject areas.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COVID-related diseases, Middle East respiratory disease (MERS, the outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some of the remaining urgent questions.
CoV is traditionally thought to be non-life-threatening pathogens for humans, leading to about 15% of the predominantly cold diseases.
However, in this century we have encountered twice the most deadly human COVID-19, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which initially originated in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to other countries with the most deadly pathologies and deaths.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third covid outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported by the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the order of CoV was issued.
The first case of death was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, health care providers reported infections that could lead to infections from humans to humans.
On January 23, there was a complete lockdown in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was shut down.
On January 24, the first medical study on the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which had been treated as an early infectious centre from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and to 50 countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final state and severity of the outbreak are still uncertain.
A multi-centric study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11 February 2020 has presented an updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but primarily targeted people in the 30-65 age group.
Half (47.7%) of the infected people were under the age of 50, even under 20, and only 14 were infected under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.27/1,00,000) than women (0.31/1,00,000).
COVID-19 has mainly spread to cities in and around Hubei.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from infection to diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average period from infection to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default recurring number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased drastically before January 23, 2020, which coincided with the larger prevalence in China before the Spring Festival.
The case fatality rate with fixed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted fatality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large and overlapping viruses that include a single thread of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
This overlapping spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then skin fusion occurs.
The infectious RNA genome is released into the cell; after replicating the virus genome, genomic RNA overlapping forms virion-containing vesicles with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then combined with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found as a new type of beta-CoV that has 99.98% genetic identities in 10 sequence samples taken from the origin of the outbreak at the Huawan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in extremely thin areas of the human atmospheric substrate.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 much weaker than the S protein of SARS-CoV, which in turn leads to a less serious infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new small proteins, which are encoded by orf3b and the secreted protein is encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and prevent the expression of IFN<0x9F>; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or purpose.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. indicated that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution has been confused with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the compounds whose compositions were open and closed were grouped together as dimers, and ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to two compounded S proteins, which provide evidence of identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to defeat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and Medium Host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were passed from fed cats and camels to humans, respectively.
On a genealogical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the local hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 with SARS-like viruses.
However, it is not known which medium carriers have helped the virus across the barrier of the species to infect humans, and the pathway of the infection is yet to be clear.
Ji, et al., has suggested that snakes should be carriers in order to reach humans from bats, which must have undergone homosexual recombination during S protein.
Researchers from Guangzhou, China, have suggested that the long-nosed, ant-eating cat, which is commonly used in traditional medicine in China, may be a potential moderate host of SARS-CoV-2, for which the genetic similarity between CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been found.
However, there is still a large gap of 1% between the two genomes divided, so concrete evidence is awaited for conclusive conclusions (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and up to 5 days at 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot withstand in ultraviolet rays and after 30 minutes at a temperature of 56 <0xC2><0xB0> C, other than ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexacin, can effectively neutralize it.
In general, the entire human race cannot cope with SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is vulnerable to this new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been conducted regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when the virus attacks the host, its first pattern is identified by Recognition Receptors (PRR), including C-type lectine-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-LI receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-LIKE receptors (RLI).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammable components, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the type I interferon (INN), which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophage phagocytosis of the viral antigen.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from the immune response.
Soon, favorable immune responses join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in the rescue.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T-Helper cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, COV T cells can inhibit function by incorporating apoptosis of T cells.
The human immune system, which contains components and antibodies like C3A and C5A, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovered patients have been identified as MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system leads to a large number of locally free cell groups causing serious damage to the lungs and other organs and worsening various organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections that start in the group are likely to be more likely to develop in older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
People who have other diseases or who have a weakened immune system are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated moderate incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most cases being 3-7 days, as in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was three days and was between 0 and 24 days.
As described above, the most recent study shows that in a population of 8,866 cases, the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Combining effective isolation periods based on the most accurate incubation period is very important for the healthcare authorities, so that infected but asymptomatic people can be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general measure, people who have come in contact with the virus or have been infected with it will most likely need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is there a need for a 24-day quarantine period?
Fever is a major and early symptom of COVID-19, accompanied by symptoms such as dry cough, cough, muscle stiffness, nausea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the disease.
In severe cases, patients immediately develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation.
The virus needs to be screened for early diagnosis of fever and/or respiratory symptoms and patients suffering from acute fever, then why pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98 percent, dry cough 76 percent, dyspnea 55 percent and diarrhoea 3%; 8% needed ventilation support.
Similar findings have also been found in two recent studies conducted on a group infected by a family group and a group infected by a person without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients, and the risk of MERS was higher than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, it has been observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases had reached 66,576 in the world, the COVID-19 fatality rate was 2%.
As of November 2002, the SARS death rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate in June 2012 was 37% of the 2494 confirmed cases based on a demographic study.
Previous studies had indicated that the RO of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than 6.47 and 95% of the confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the RO of SARS-CoV was between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and RO is given in Table 1.1.
The above data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but is less lethal of both.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Collective beginnings often begin in the same family or in the same ceremony or in the same vehicle as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected persons or have been in contact with them for the past two weeks prior to the start of treatment.
However, it has been suggested that people can hold the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovering patients who have been discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again which has threatened to extend the quarantine period.
The normal or declining number of patients at the initial stage are peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with white blood cells, lymphopenia <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L containing <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L lymphocyte numbers and advanced aminotransferase levels and viremia were found.
There was an increase in liver and muscle enzyme levels and in the blood of some patients with myoglobin, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte layer had increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the fibroid degradation production in the blood had increased de-diamer levels and lymphocyte counts had decreased rapidly.
In most COVID-19 patients, abnormalities were found in chest radiography and are characterized by a biliar patchy shadow or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid storage, and progressive thickening affect air exchange intensely.
A breakdown of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes reduces surface level and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to transmit and increases the risk of lung deterioration.
Therefore, the worst radiographic findings are often the most serious illnesses.
The first diagnostic assessment of COVID-19 on February 18, 2020 showed that the decomposition of pneumocytes, the formation of disinfectant screens and the intrusion into the central lymphocyte and the multinucleated syncretic cells in the lungs of the patient who died of the disease are the same as the viral infection diagnoses and ARDS consistent with the MERS.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate accelerating the pandemic, the use of medical disclosures for diagnosis began in China on February 13, 2020 (which no longer depends solely on RT-PCR).
The situation was similar with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, medical disclosure, laboratory tests, and radiological findings are important and essential to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, in which 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L per micron of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibers within an hour without the need for extensive means using a dipstych.
It is hoped that if verified in the medical samples, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
As there is a lack of experience regarding the new CoV, physicians can only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients and look for other viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and using various treatment methods previously used or proposed on other CoVs such as disease (Table 2).
These treatment methods include current and potential treatments including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and mental support.
Not only this, the cells of the recovered patients were also proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly trying to produce antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal and intestinal systems and kidneys.
Therefore, respiratory failure and deterioration poses a major risk to patients and is the leading cause of death.
Therefore, the respiratory system needs to be supported to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen treatment, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for lethal cardiovascular or respiratory disorders.
It is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent secondary infection and septic shock, and protect the function of key organs.
It has been reported that the additional response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients results in cytokine storms.
The cytokine storm is the form of a systemic inflammatory response that occurs due to the release of a series of cytokines that include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which is the leading cause of ARDS and various organ failures.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody corticosteroids and tocilizumab are used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for the cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune response, prevention of IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF, JAK inhibition, suppressor of bleitomob, cytokine signaling 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high amounts of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect the diagnosis.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids are recommended to be used with care for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this, no effective antiviral treatment was confirmed.
However, it has been found to be effective when a U.S. patient with COVID-19 is given remdesivir through veins.
Remdesivir is a rare antiviral drug developed by Zilid to treat diseases initially caused by Ebola and the Marlburg virus.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential blockages for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on this, Zilid provided this ingredient to China to conduct tests on patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the findings were very promising.
BarictyNB, Interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Ribavirin have been recommended as potential treatments for patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients.
There is a long history of collecting the blood of an infectious disease patient to treat patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting sick.
It is true that the number of antibodies in the blood of the recovered patients is higher than that of the pathogens.
Antibodies to fight off pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulins (IGs) that are produced by B lymphocytes and that identify specific molecules in pathogens and destroy them directly.
On this basis, cells were collected from the blood of the group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 patients who were critically ill were cured.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as reduced inflammation and virus pressure, and improved blood circulation.
However, unless specific treatment methods are developed, verification and clarification are required for large-scale use.
At the same time, for therapeutic effects, some of the harms associated with cells need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially toxic.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells to treat a critically ill patient is high.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic.
It is therefore important and practical to isolate the B cells from the recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode the effective antibodies or test the effective antibodies against the virus' essential proteins.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effect depends heavily on the combination of various elements in the formula according to the TCM theory of diagnosis of the disease.
Most of the effective components are unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to remove and verify such components or their highest combination.
As there is currently a lack of effective and specific treatment methods for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the alternative treatment options for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have been cured in critical stages.
For example, Shoe Feng Jie Doo Capsules and Lian Hua King Wayne Capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
Among the 87% of patients who used TCM for the treatment of COVID-19, China reported the highest number of recoveries in different provinces, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients, reported the lowest (13%).
However, this is a somewhat broad comparison because other impact factors such as the number of patients and severity should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing only Western medicine (WM) with combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the duration of recovery of body temperature, symptoms of dehydration and hospitalization was much less in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most importantly, the rate of symptomatic growth (slight to severe) was much lower in WM<0x2B>TCM than in the only WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and even lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the only WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, for the effectiveness and safety of TCM, large-scale controlled trials need to be conducted at more centres.
It would be somewhat strange to characterize the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatment or their combination, if possible.
Most of the patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience highly contagious or fatal illness, and those in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as corticosteroids can lead to anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, emotional disorders such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic stimulation, malignant symptoms, confusion and suicidal feeling were reported.
Mandatory contact tracking and isolation as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more worried about infection, isolation, and guilt among family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those in contact with them as well as the general public in need.
Psychiatric support includes the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health group, accurate news and treatment plans for the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the use of professional electrical devices and the use of applications to prevent close contact with others.
There must be an effective vaccine to break the chain of transmission from virus stockpiles in animals to infected human-sensitive hosts, and the vaccine can often be used for anti-virus treatment to control the epidemic caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts are being made to develop a protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and qualitative antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-sweetened vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, prior to the start of medical studies, the candidates who were given the vaccine have not yet discovered the physical efficacy and the protective elements against the deadly virus infection in adults and animal-borne samples.
This may be due to the fact that the impact of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Conversely, the emergence of urgent cases and some collective occurrences of MERS have occurred in eastern countries and continue to spread to other regions which show that animal-proliferated sources exist in the epidemiological region.
Vaccination strategy for MERS was formulated using ineffective viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microbes, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-resistant individuals is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is challenging because it requires longevity (average of 18 months) to develop a vaccine and the dynamic diversity of CoV.
With the new disease, COVID-19 has now begun to show its entire medical sequence among thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can be cured gradually without any recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, it is imperative for healthcare institutions to establish a diagnostic model to prioritise their services, especially in resource-less areas.
Based on medical studies so far indicated, the following factors may be related to or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases as described above, 47.7% of patients who were above 50 years of age with COVID-19 were between the ages of 30-65.
Patients in need of intensive therapy were more likely to have implicit disorders and complications and were much older than those who did not (at the middle age of 51 compared to 66), suggesting that age is a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Co-morbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care are likely to suffer from serious heart disease and rhythmias.
Heart disease is also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE-2 positive collangiocytes, which can lead to liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that age and present diseases are related and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and are a potential long-term prognosis factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The severity of COVID-19 and the correlation of the CRP level with the diagnosis have also been reported.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine cyanase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and in tissue damage.
Therefore, they are a traditional viewer for heart or liver disorders.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and transitory growth of medical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to make a conclusive and complex prediction of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used in the form of auxiliary treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
With high doses of corticosteroids being widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from lifelong disability and unvaccinated osteoarthritis.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and short-term in COVID-19 patients if needed.
Mental Stress: As described above, many patients suffered from additional stress during the COVID-19 outbreak because they had to stay in isolation and in a very uncertain state for a long time and witnessed the deaths of family members and relatives.
It is essential to provide mental counseling and long-term support so that they can recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic look different from that of SARS.
The recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 can occur more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract and may cause mild or no symptoms at the initial stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause a cold.
Therefore, infected patients at the initial stage or during the retention period can produce a large number of viruses during daily activities, which can make it very difficult to control the pandemic.
However, when a patient is seriously ill, SARS-CoV infection is believed to spread, but most infections do not occur in the early stages.
As a result, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the SARS outbreak and is difficult to control.
At present, efforts are being made in China to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which includes lockdowns in Wuhan and nearby cities, and to keep almost the entire population in constant isolation.
Although these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing and the pandemic seems to be decreasing.
The most optimistic prediction is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter has predicted that COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has set up a sample to predict the consequences of the pandemic and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the mid-turbinate and throat swabs of a patient who was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago after recovering from the disease, which shows that the newly identified virus can come in a cyclonic chain like influenza.
However, on the basis of the declining number of new cases, there are promising signs from China, which seems to be having a positive impact on current policies.
It was initially estimated that Ebola would cause millions of cases and cause five million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control due to severe isolation.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, will weaken until it becomes ineffective and eventually destroy or become less pathogenic viruses that coexist with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious by coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus has also been found in the urine, which has increased the chances of infection from the urine to the urine.
A recent study on 138 cases indicated that 41% of the cases may have been caused by hospitalized infections, with 17 patients having other pre-existing illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, it is necessary to be very careful to protect the people, especially the health care providers, social workers, family members, co - operatives and so on, not only the third person who comes in contact with the patient or infected person.
The first step to reduce the risk of infection is to use face masks; surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23>1860s) both help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent potentially infectious persons from moving fluid points from the air to the surface of the material, so that their infection does not spread to others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23>1860) masks can stop the respiration of micro-viruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus entering completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm in size.
As particles can also enter through five surgical masks on one side, healthcare providers with direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series <0x23> 1860) without wearing a surgical mask.
Along with masks, healthcare providers must also wear a fitted isolation gown to avoid contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 20, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.
Therefore, it is necessary for healthcare providers to use a transparent face covering or Google when working with patients.
The general public in the affected or potentially affected areas is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A proper distance of three feet is observed for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures have been taken to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus in the human world, as it was recorded on January 7, 2020, the SARS-CoV should have been alarming in China due to the memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center was telling people that the new virus is less infectious and less reproducible from humans to humans, and it is not difficult to inhibit and control the disease.
This message greatly reduced the sense of caution among the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and missed the crucial time to contain the disease at a minimum level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can learn from this tough lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take further precautions when making a public announcement (1) because every word spoken to the citizen is important and can change his or her attitude and decision; (2) to be more sensitive and responsive to the abnormal information in the clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or nurses; and to be more responsive when it comes to improving the responses and timing of treatments; (3) to provide relief to the public, and to prevent the potential pandemic in the early stages with more restrictions in the society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, which started in late December 2019.
Within two months of writing this article, it spread across China and across 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of return to SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than young people, and the incidence and mortality rate is higher in older people than young people.
The fatality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent vs. 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients infect the virus without symptoms, SARS patients only do so when they are seriously ill, it has become much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV-2.
Regular RNA assessments of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be re-infected with the virus.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
The rapid progress of this research on COVID-19 has not solved many important issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-CoV-2, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from bats.
Which animal was the medium species to infect the virus from the original host, the bat or the human?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can never come back again.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluations have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the cells of the atrial fibrillation and then the pathogen changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE-2 expression cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during an infection in humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, a SARS-like extinction, or a flu-like outbreak?
The above and many other questions need to be answered but it can take some time.
However, we have no choice but to get rid of the pandemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normalcy.
The origins of human coronavirus disease
The mutation and adaptation of the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its cells, together with humans, has been encouraged for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause mild illnesses such as a cold.
The outbreaks of acute acute respiratory disease (SARS) and Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) have shown how devastating and deadly HCoV infections are.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back to light and surprised us with its high transmissibility, but its immunity was lower compared to its easy-to-use SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is a zoonotic disease and therefore it is important for us to understand the origins of the zoonotic disease of HCOV.
Most of the HCoV is derived from whales where they are non-infectious.
Some HCoV intermediates are also known.
Recognition of animal piercings for the prevention of human diseases can have a direct impact.
Exploration of the interaction of COV-cells in animals may shed light on important information on COV pathogens in humans.
In this review, we are presenting a review of the existing information of seven HCoVs, whose main focus is on the history of their discovery as well as the origin and interstices of their veterinary disease.
What is important is that we compare different HCoVs from the point of view of virus development and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic has been discussed in this regard.
In addition, the need for a successful change of the spine and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
The coronavirus (COV) belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of injected, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
Among these RNA viruses, the viruses that shelter the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases are referred to as "COVs" because they look like crowns under electron microscopes.
Structurally, COVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome has two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicas.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which are classified as NSP1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural protein, which includes spike (s), envolpe (e), membrane (m) and nucleoprotein (n).
Numerous genes-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded through different genes of COV.
COVs are classified into four generations (alpha-COV, beta-COV, gamma-COV, and delta-COV), of which the beta-COV generation contains the most HCoVs and would have divided them into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rats act as a genetic source for most alpha-COV and beta-COV, while birds are the main sources for gamma-COV and delta-COV.
For thousands of years, COV has been continuously crossing the barrier of species and has emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
At present, there are seven known human COVs (ACOVs).
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MRS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogens, which cause acute respiratory infections in relatively high patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary management.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E variant, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 that produce self-limiting symptoms.
Thus, there was a widespread perception that the infection caused by HCoV was generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people, including an estimated 10% of crude cases.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continued pandemonium on the Arabian Peninsula that quickly spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV) which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2 was the cause of the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm bell is constantly ringing and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven ACOVs have their roots in bats, rats or pets.
Various evidence reinforces the theory of origin from bats, in which the viruses absorbed the condition and are not pathogenic but showing extraordinary genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic poses enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origins of the animal disease of ACOV shows the structure of the natural history, impulse force and restriction factors behind species jumping.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2's shelter, intermediate and amplifier parasite (V) posinda, which will play an important role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of animal diseases, inter-species infections and pathogenesis of HCoV.
Specifically, we emphasize and discuss the following general themes that the parent virus of HCoV is not generally pathogenic in its natural parasitic veins but becomes pathogenic when an interspecies infection occurs in the new veins.
We also reviewed the art of HCoV evolution in which if the infectiousness increases, the pathogenesis decreases.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animals have known about COV since the late 1930s.
Before being isolated for the first time, different COVs were isolated from different infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E pathology was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and since then, there has been an increase in WI-38 lung cell lines.
HCoV-229E showed symptoms of cold in infected patients, including headache, wrinkles, particles and sore throat, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the small rat's organ culture and then from the brain's cerebellum.
The clinical features of the HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of the HCoV-229E infection, which is not distinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as the influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally and are mainly infected during the winter season in low-temperature environments.
In general, the boiling period of these two viruses is less than a week followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study on human volunteers, HCoV-229E has developed a mild cold in infected healthy individuals.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems have severe respiratory infections.
SARS, which is called "attical pneumonia" which was the first properly documented universally transmitted HCoV in human history and the etiological factor is SARS-CoV, is the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases, including 774 deaths, which spread across many countries and continents.
It is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a boiling period of 4 to 7 days, and the top effect of the virus can be seen on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially experience muscle pain, headache, fever, particles and chills and then shortness of breath, cough and then shortness of breath.
There are common abnormalities in the laboratory, such as lymphatic degeneration, impaired liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase.
Diffuse alveolar loss, atrophy cell growth and an increase in macrophages have also been found in SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients require hypertension and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infectious to this serious disease, often leading to a cytokine storm, which can be particularly fatal for patients with immune deficiency.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there has been a lot of research on HIV.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially found to be more common in children, the elderly and patients suffering from respiratory failure.
Infections caused by HCoV-NL63 are common in colds, eyesight, fever, and respiratory infections.
In another independent study, the same virus was isolated from the nose of an eight-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is found in the Netherlands, it has spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7 percent of common respiratory diseases and most of its prevalence occurs in the summer, spring, and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive rheumatoid arthritis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from the 71-year-old who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and respiratory disease.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma decomposition, including community-recovered pneumonia and respiratory ailments.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found around the world, leading to mild respiratory diseases.
All these four community-acquired HCoVs are systematically accepted in humans and are less likely to mutate into highly pathogenic diseases, but accidents can also occur due to unknown causes, such as those in more viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have recently been reported to cause severe respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to infect efficiently and to persist continuously in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012 who had acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Although most of the confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases imported from other European countries and Tunisia were reported on the occasion due to close contact.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
Mercury's medical symptoms are similar to those of SARS, which are manifested by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients suffering from MERS suffered from severe kidney failure, which is very unusual for MERS in HCoV-related diseases.
The number of patients with diarrhoea and vomiting was more than 30%.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases were reported, accounting for 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to mankind.
From mid-December 2019 to late-December 2019, a group of pneumonia patients with the predominantly known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of a lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with the crude case fatality rate at 3.4%.
In China, Hubei's case fatality rate was 4.2%, while outside, it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are caused by fever, cough and respiratory illness.
Excessive stress was also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly lead to an increase in severe respiratory tract infections.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence perception, they are in different branches in the phylogenetic structure.
SARS-CoV-2 is less infectious, but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has reported non-symptomatic cases and may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows a large degree of similarity and similarity.
First of all, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and HCoVs from four communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by symptoms that occur during a common HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even if the prevalence is low, there is a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 even in the case of SARS-CoV infection.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by the interesting patterns of both HCoV and SARS-CoV derived from the community.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2's infection capacity is as high as the HCoV obtained from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2's transmission capacity decreases as cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spread to humans.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be seen in asthma samples.
It is to be noted from future studies as to whether the fetal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role similar to that of SARS-CoV in at least some circumstances.
It will also be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal, just like the HCoV cases received from the community.
However, after the outbreak in humans, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including infectiousness, pathogenesis and sustainable transmission among humans, will be effective for the final future of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs from all the four communities that produce mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoV and human-caused HCoV diseases that cause serious diseases in humans should be eradicated.
For this to happen, HCoVs should be replicated in humans to an adequate extent to store favorable mutations which would thwart the prevention factors of pimples.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully compatible with humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its spread in humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
For many years, four people have been infected with the virus that causes people to become infected with the virus.
These animals do not need shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogens SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted properly to humans and their infections in humans will not be sustainable.
They need to be allowed to maintain and spread their livestock shelters and to reach resilient human targets as far as possible through one or more mediators and promoters.
The features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in both SARS-CoV/Mers-CoV and the four HCoVs from the community.
At the moment, it is as infectious as the HCoV obtained from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoV obtained from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
They will be fully compatible with humans without shelter or intermediate animal shelters and will continue to see if they will spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it would be appropriate for you to discuss the definitions and features of HCoV evolutionary, natural, shelter, intermediate and promoter posinda.
An animal can become a victim of the evolution of HCoV if it has sheltered a close relative ancestor who shares a high understanding at the level of nucleotide sequence.
In these veins, the ancestor virus is often adapted and is not pathogenic.
Similarly, parasites provide permanent and long-term shelter to the host HCoV.
In both cases, the fungus is naturally infectious and is the natural fungus of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is put in the middle host even before or during its introduction to humans, it does not adapt to the new host and becomes most likely pathogenic.
These intermediates can then act as animal feeds of human infection and play the role of propagation feeds by allowing the virus to replicate momentarily and then transmit to humans to increase the scope of human infection.
An HCoV infection can be eliminated if it is not able to sustain its infection in the intermediate vertebrae.
On the contrary, HCoV can accept intermediate fungi and not only that, but also establish long-term pathologies.
In this case, the intermediate parasite becomes the natural parasite.
Epidemiological data have revealed that the contact history of the first case of SARS has been revealed with predatory animals.
The subsequent seroprevalence investigations showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IgG was higher among animal traders than in the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs were first identified in the live animal market carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reinforced by the fact that no further SARS was recorded after killing all the Civets in the market.
However, it was also noted that masked palm civets in forests or farms that were not exposed to the live animal market were negative for most of the SARS-CoVs, suggesting that the masked palm civets may be intermediate prophylaxis, but SARS-CoVs may not have natural shelters.
It is worth noting that 80% of different animals in Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so the possibility that different species of small mammals may also be acting as a middle promoter for SARS-CoV is also not ruled out.
All of this is seen as the final destination of the SARS-CoV.
The subsequent discovery of the SARS-CoV's natural habitat was the discovery of a closely related bat COV, called SARS-related rhinopopus bat COV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BatCOV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horsepower whale.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
These and other bats share an understanding of the order of 88-92% of nucleotide along with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats feed on the evolving human pathogens.
Several SARS-like COVs (SL-COVs) were identified from bats, but none other than the virus could be isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from the specimen of bats' debris which was exhibited to be used as a catalyst for the entry of bats, civets and human ACE2 cells.
Interestingly, the SARS patient's blood water from the disease was able to depress WIV1.
Therefore, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV among bats that share 95% nucleotide sequence perception.
Although there is a high degree of understanding between the two viruses, it is generally understood that WIV1 is not the SARS-CoV-mediated parent virus and bats are not the immediate parasite of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis combines the MERS-CoV into the same group as COV-HKU4 and BAT-COV-HKU5.
The bats use cov-HKU4 and mars-CoV poshinda grahi, dipeptidyl peptidease 4 (DPP4) for virus penetration.
MERS-CoV's RN polymers are genetically close to the mutations found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live mers-CoV has been found in the wild.
Only 87 per cent of the nucleotide sequences in the MERS-CoV and its closely related bat COV-HKU25 are known to be nucleotides.
Thus, it is possible that bats are not immediately parasites of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to the MERS-COV specific neutralizing antipinda, as are camels from the Middle East found in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from the swab in the nose of the dromedary camel, further indicating that the camels act as parasite feeders to the beneficiaries of MERS-CoV.
It is interesting to note that generally mild symptoms but a large number of virulent experimental methods led to the conclusion that MERS-CoV had sheltered in infected camels.
Notably, infected camels not only shelter the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the defecation-oriented way, which is also the main way to shelter the whale from the virus.
However, the question remains that there is no contact history with camels before symptoms appear in many confirmed cases of MERS, human-to-human transmission pathways or unknown infection pathways that are likely to cause the species of unidentified animals that shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide connotation with bat COV RATG13 isolated from bats associated with rhinoplasty.
As is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the order differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG 13 is very good for determining a parenting relationship.
This means that bats are likely to not be an immediate parasite of SARS-CoV-2, unless they have the same type of bat-CoV in the future.
Most of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediates should be from a wildlife species that was sold and killed at the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the earliest cases related to COVID-19, who are an eyewitness to the possibility of the occurrence of the animal-to-human infection.
Numerous recent research on the basis of the meta-genomic order has indicated that a group of small mammals in danger known as pangolins (Manis javanika - khavel cats) may also have sheltered ancestor beta-CVO associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pangolins COV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence perception with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 at approximately 90% homogeneity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sub-branches in a poisonous genealogical tree like SARS-CoV-2, one of which shares the 97.4% amino acid sequence identities, more similar to SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast to the inevitable truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more diverse, although the higher the ratio is the higher the order of the genome-wide perception.
Recent research on sick pangolins has also reported a layer of the virus on lung samples, which were found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a separate assembly method and physical curation to produce a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of full-length virus genomes.
You cannot rule out the possibility that one of the intermediate animal cells of SARS-CoV-2 is a pangolin.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the original live pangolins of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
In addition, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also significantly less than the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
It remains to be seen how SARS-CoV-2 evolves in bats, pangolins and other mammals.
While RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins have the highest degree of semantics, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide semantics.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high level of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs of Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-COV and the selectively-medical equivalency variants of SARS-CoV-2.
There is an alternative proposal in the benefit of recombination between Pangolins SARS-CoV-2 related beta-COV and RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still looking into the immediate animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Genetic evidence has shown that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both originated from the bat's COV, while the parent virus of HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 was found in stray animals.
It has been reported that the COV in bats was found in ARCOV.2 (Appalasian Ridge COV) North American triangular bats, showing close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is related to chromosome chromosome in another bat COV, named Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, at the same time, the chromosome was suspected to be their intermediate source.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs in Figures 1 and Table 2 is summarized.
Evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoV in history has been presented through genetic analysis.
In the 1890s, when HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans from domestic livestock, respiratory infections were reported.
The history of the transmission of HCoV-229E is very clear.
Alpha-CoV has been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
One of them is Alpha-CoV.
There are several levels of evidence supporting the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it is likely that humans have come into contact with bats, not alpacas, in a shared environment.
Humans are more closely related to algae.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are isolated and non-pathogenic in alpha-COV bats, while alpha-COV has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Alpha-CoV has not been found in animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas received the HCoV-229e-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is a genetic stock of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels can act as intermediates that can infect viruses in humans, as in the case of mers-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origins of the MERS-CoV from bats are known for its early identification and have also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is apparent that bats provide a rich stock of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
All these ideal conditions, such as longevity, a thriving colony, close social interaction and the ability to fly, have made bats ideal as 'toxic broadcasters'.
On the other hand, Mars-CoV has been in the dromedary camel for decades.
These camels have accepted them well which has made them stable and natural parasites from the intermediate postulate.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Infection to a small proportion of humans is an accident and humans are prone to MERS-CoV because their infection is not sustained.
The role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV is, in the conclusion of SARS-CoV-2, different from the role of pangolins, if any, in contradiction.
In particular, pangolin beta-COV is a high level of pathogen in pangolins.
They can be prophylactic for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, just as in cases of SARS-CoVs, the cat is.
In future research, the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infections from animals to humans should be considered or ruled out.
First, bats can be parasites of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the environment with bats by slaughtering them or through a coal mine.
Pangolins, on the other hand, may be one of the mediators of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has recently been identified.
Human contact with viruses is caused by the slaughter and eating of the hunted fish.
It is possible that many mammals including pets are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for animal testing and animal testing.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still underway.
Three key factors in favour of the COV virus are also important in facilitating the overcoming of the barrier of the second species, apart from the different types of animal infestations.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-plate RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COV depends on the stage of approval of the new strain of COV, while the average replacement rate can be calculated from "small" to "high," with a replacement of -10-4 per site per year.
COV has evidence-reading exoribonuclease, which can lead to the removal of high amounts of mutations in overcoming and degrading or even affecting vitality.
Surprisingly, the nucleotide analogy Remdesivir is known to inhibit the resistance of these exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymers to replicate the COV.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 being tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of COV is about a million times the rate of their spine.
Moreover, when COVs are not well accepted by the body, the mutation rate is always high.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, indicating a higher level of acceptance to humans.
It may have been used by other human beings.
This also applies to the MERS-CoV as an emphasis on SARS-CoV-2, which has been well accepted by DroneDroid Untani.
Theoretically, it is impossible that the malignant discharge would make the ineffectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 waterbornely inoculated and condition-viral.
Second, the large RNA genomes in COVs draw an additional amount of resilience into genome correction for mutation and recombination, which increases the chances of interspecies co-evolution, when conditions become conducive to the emergence of novel COV.
It is supported by many other open-read frames and by protein actions that are encrypted to 3' at the end of the genome.
Third, COVs switch templates between RNA replicas randomly and frequently through such a "copy-select" mechanism.
In the veins they act as a mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during the transcription of COV RNA.
The high-profile full-length and sub-genomic RNAs can be recombined to create new COVs.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in animals such as bat SL-COV and bat COV-HKU9.
Interaction between viruses and invaders in relation to infection
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, the viral interaction with the receiver is another important factor that is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which has also shown evidence of a positive choice during the events of interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV isolators, it appears that SARS-CoV has been rapidly adopted in different directions, especially with mutations in the RBD of S protein.
In general, in RBDs in S protein, the COV interacts with the cell receiver and is selected by the antibody response of the spleen with passion.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are on the S1 continent in the 318th to 510th Amino Amla, which binds human ACE2 as well as recipients to enter the virus.
SARS-CoV's RBD allows interspecies transmission of viruses capable of detecting various animal ACE2 recipients, including bats, cats, rats, and raccoon dogs.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues in RBD between human and civet virus is found to be different, and 4 of them are located in the receiver-bonding pattern for interaction with the ACE2 recipient.
In SARS-CoVs, K489N and S487T mutants are in their RBDs, which can reinforce the desire for the interaction of spike proteins, including human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be important in virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that the bonding desire of their S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Of course, a cryo-EM study has shown that these hostages have a 10- to 20-fold higher desire than the bonds between human ACE2 and SARS-CoVS proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine the requirement of any other co-applicant for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 may also be linked to ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are numerous other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated cialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful acceptance of this COV in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal feeders.
As an emphasis on cell intake, the effect of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other nutrient dependencies and preventive factors.
The absorption of these nutrient proteins between the natural cumulative nutrients of HCoV such as humans and bats, dromedary camels and rodents can be an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
The successful interspecies transmission of HCoV does not have to strengthen nutrient dependence components and overwhelm the nutrient containment components.
In this context, the molecular determinants are yet to be identified and their characteristics are to be determined in the part of this important virulent-nutrient interaction.
Using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR for SARS-CoV-2, a non-biased scrutiny of the genome-wide and prevention factors of nutrient dependence may be useful.
The emergence of a new HCoV: going back to zero
Variety of bat COVs provides a lot of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this way, the bat COV is used as the genetic stock of HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombinations also cause HCoV evolution and serve as two important stages in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter viral visuals.
Among SARS-CoV-assisted proteins, ORF8 is considered to be important to be accepted in humans, as the SARS-CoV-related whale viruses are found when isolated, but uncodified ORF8 proteins are encoded.
The generic variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was isolated at the beginning of the disease, has been found to remove the 29-nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2.
As it is removed, ORF8 divides into ORF8a and ORAP8b and is considered an accepted mutation, which promotes the migration of nutrients.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with an alpha- and gamma-CoV genealogy, in which a large number of small recombinant parts are found in RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in NSP 9, most in NSP 10, and in parts of NSP 14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the Pandemic Mers-CoV has been experienced in cases of recombination in different genealogies, which have been found in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been reported in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs are recombined with other animals' COVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection can also contribute to the unwanted replacement of the virus genome, which in most cases frees the virus from selective pressure used by the nutrient immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype and the removal of two nucleotides.
Union ORF4 can be found in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOC-229E, alpaca alpha-COV refers to the single nucleotide inclusion, which is affected in the frameshift.
Last but not the last, the evolution of the new HCoV is also made possible by the pressure of selection from their parasite bases.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with COV, which indicates mutual acceptance between COV and bats.
It seems that the bats accepted the COV both physically and physiologically well.
For example, the defect in the activation of the pre-professional response of the bat reduces the efficiency of the pathology implemented by the COV.
In addition, the inhibition of NKG2/CD94 of the natural anti-inflammatory cell activity in bats and the lower level of the main oligonucleotide compound I molecule is suppressed.
In addition, both the high levels of reactive oxygen type (ROS) derived from the high-metabolism activity of whales suppresses the COV replication process and influences the prophylaxis through exoribonuclease, thus, when ingested into the new nutrient, the genesis of the virus is largely pathogenic to provide
More pathogenic COV ancestry also evolved into recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to accept nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not been accidentally generated in the last two decades.
COVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasites, such as bats or camels.
Those potent venous immune responses do not properly replicate without taking away the response.
Here is the secret of why asymptomatic carriers appeared and what is causing a serious problem in human infection.
Severe symptoms are found mainly due to the high activation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, while where the immune response is stronger, more acute lung damage appears to occur.
On the contrary, in the asymptomatic carrier, the immune response is dissociated from replicating the COV.
The SARS-CoV-2 anti-COV-2 treatment may have the same beneficial strategy to break down the immune response.
In particular, the interferon response is strong.
Thus, the management of at least type-I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is faulty.
For this reason, the MCC950 co-supposition of NLRP3 inflammatory can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the usual method, through which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arise.
In contrast, the beta-COV of bats was found to have a 95% nucleotide compatibility with SARS-CoV, where bats also have a 96% nucleotide compatibility with SARS-CoV-2.
However, despite the presence of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in the market, there is no immediate mediator for SARS-CoV-2.
The understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in Pangolins beta-CoV has been surprisingly found, indicating that Pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate sources or that Pangolins beta-CoV may have contributed to the genetic breakdown in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either deliberate or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 has once again come to the fore.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically altered our understanding of the importance of parasitic fungi of HCoV in animal origin and human infection.
Evidence of the spread showed that bats have their origins in SARS-CoV, MERS-COV and SARS-CoV-2 and that their transmission to humans was through intermediate pathways.
The origin of SARS-CoV infection stemmed from contact with the market of human and UD cats, the closure of the seafood market and the killing of UD cats there effectively ended the outbreak.
For the same reason, Pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market in order to prevent animal infections, given the discovery that they are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, a multi-ethnic group of Pangolins beta-CoV.
However, future research remains to explain whether and how humans have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins and other mammals.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
It is an important means of transportation and has been a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, just as it was done in China's wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent a repeat of the MERS outbreak, a holistic approach to developing an effective vaccine against a MERS-CoV for camels should be undertaken, together with the convergence of other infection control measures.
Because we cannot eradicate these viruses, new pathogens can arise to cause outbreaks.
There are also a wide variety of animal species in the wild.
In particular, BATCOV is also very diverse in terms of animal potential.
There are numerous opportunities for evolution and recombination of these animal COVs, which will result in the emergence of a new COV of a more transmissible and/or life-threatening nature in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China.
In the order of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they get the opportunity to expand.
Although bats have many characteristics of spreading the virus, training people to stay away from bats and other wildlife species can reduce their contact with humans.
In order to better understand the life cycle of COVs and their natural habitats, there is a need to continuously monitor the mammals, which can be useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
To put an end to this, the most effective way to prevent the zoonotic virus is to keep humans away from the location of the natural habitat of the zoonotic virus.
Numerous pieces of the code of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
For the first time, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins share the same ecological location if a bat infected the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus into the pangolins.
Secondly, if bats have played a more direct role in human infection, it will have to decide how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammals really acted as intermediaries, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Lastly, many mammals, including pets, should be infected, monitored and experimentally, with the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive.
Whether it is bats, pangolins, or other mammals, the SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral virus will be similarly identified in their natural habitats in the future.
The evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in enduring exploration animals in the region will highlight important insights into the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Quick Advisory Guidelines for Molecular Treatment for the Diagnosis of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and these guiding principles have made a good reference to our affluent and worldwide fight against the pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the discovery of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice, therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, a comment on our guideline is highlighted and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (seventh edition) "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" are provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has been officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named as Civic Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick advice guides and they have been published online in Military Medical Risk on February 06, 2020.
It has gained a lot of attention since it was published.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness-raising knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; so these diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), a total of seven volumes of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 published between 16th January 2020 and 3rd March 2020, have been published in a tabular form.
Now that our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al., they have submitted a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guidelines and has also made a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We appreciate his work and thank him for it.
However, his work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (Test Seventh Edition) and recent studies.
As per the Seventh Edition (March 3, 2020), confirmation of the suspected case is required to combine any one of the two items of the epidemiological history feature with two items of the clinical invention, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three items of the medical invention need to be completed.
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms, in the area where symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported in the first week, and in the region where symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported; (2) the history of contact with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in the previous cases (including positive nucleic acid tests) of the city of Wuhan, or in the surrounding area where symptoms have been reported).
Clinical inventions: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the imaging characteristic of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing the number of total white cells in the early stages of normalized, or reduced lymphocytes.
Diagnosis of confirmed confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with either one of the components of pathogenic or serological evidence as given in advance: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV4 positive per dose, or a positive PCR test for IRS-CoV-2 per dose; (2) a complete genetic sequence of IRS-CoV showing a high community of known novel coronaviruses; (3) a serum test
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions
The pathological identification of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) versions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers, including the inclusion of blood samples from the respiratory tract to identify optimum nucleic acids for this rapid diagnosis, who have increased the availability of different samples, and supported the positive impact of certain antibodies in confirmed criteria.
Apart from that, there was more and more evidence which reminded us to be careful with sampling symptomatic and asymptomatic ailments.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they are classifying the person as a "low risk" without clinical symptoms.
There is also a need to verify the score system in further clinical practice and study.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to the readers to give their comments.
In order to diagnose "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we must follow the latest guidelines from our country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases, as reported.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, Dr. Mirzade Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mirzade, two cases were in the age group of 60 years, two in the age group of 51 to 60 years, and one in the age group of 41-50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were in custody.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A local news outlet, Adolu Agency, said one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Friendship Hospital in Kuwait.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will remain closed for a longer period than initially planned until Saturday.
The shutdown was scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on April 4.
Transport of essential commodities - medical, fuel and non-combustible - is still permitted.
The first case of COVID-19 reported in Bangladesh on March 8, including two people returning from Italy and his wife.
On March 19, all three of them had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, Johns Hopkins University data showed that the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed their coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it was one of the few countries to be free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours, at 10.00 a.m. on April 4 at Central European Time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, of which 5,900 deaths have been linked.
CBS News, quoting Johns Hopkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 people died in the U.S. on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Around the world, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, postponed the lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to receive their salaries until April 30 without going to work.
Portugal's parliament extended the national and state of emergency by 15 days, with a resolution passed by 215 votes, 10 standing, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: Previously, the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand has imposed a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, has extended the order at his home until May 1.
Australia's retailers have reduced the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sundays and Saturdays evenings, the Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles reduced the ban on the purchase of its toilet paper to two, respectively, and one package per transaction to the national level.
ALDI also launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits are posted as messages on the checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, buyers are storing it again and again because of the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
These changes have come after the four-pack ban on previous transactions submitted by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in its March 8 disclosure, reported that there would be a four-pack ban, "many stores are selling within an hour of delivery," and said the demand was "unbelievable," while ALDI, in its Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there has been a "substantial increase" in sales over the past week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount to two packs last week.
To further mitigate the shortfall, Coles ordered large packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made early availability for scheduled Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said the retailer tried to increase stocks, but the local council's truck-supply time restriction made it difficult.
They expect an increase in production costs, because the suppliers want to meet the demand, and a lower amount of specials.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to the early dispatch of the stock, some stores could not run specials on Wednesday.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said that stores are filling stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large item, which leads to a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when sold, vacates a large amount of shelf space.
"If there are numerous objects on the self, such as toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there are more in there, you will reduce the likelihood of panic," Russell Zimmerman said, according to ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said that his stock is exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, emphasized that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply smoothly.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne were offering free toilet paper to the bidder who had the first bid on his auction, when nothing was auctioned as the buyers had time during the big weekend of Labour Day.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, eight water inserts were added, to be printed daily in Darwin, to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, the store was originally against imposing restrictions, in which it said it had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman stated that there is also a huge demand for food products including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, British online supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening restricted the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-roll.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2, an outbreak of COVID-19, a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
Although the term "global co-operation" is more concerned with how much a disease is spread than with how dangerous certain events are, the WHO has stated that concrete actions need to be taken by governments.
All countries can still change the cash flow of this global pandemic
"If the nations recognize this as a response, they have tested, treated, quarantined, tracked, and united their people in this fight,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said."
We are deeply concerned about both the danger level and the seriousness of the spread and the alarming level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this is "unprecedented" with the world.
In comments published in CNN in February, he said, "The track has not been tracked from the emergence of any other respiratory-related virus without influenza until it becomes a global spread."
"We have never seen a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus," he said.
He added: "We haven't seen a world that can be controlled at the same time."
The current state of the global pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "It is certain that the situation will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, along with the 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes severe respiratory ailments.
The outbreak was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has been declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has been recognized as a global contagion since 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories of COVID-19, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 3,64,000 people have been cured.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, with Algeria in the world at 13.04% to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and fever.
Pneumonia and respiratory distress can be a symptom of complications.
The time from infection to showing symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral treatments are known.
Preventive measures recommended include hand washing, covering the mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from other people, monitoring and self-isolating those who are suspected to have the infection.
Officials around the world have responded by curbing travel, isolating, curbing communications, controlling workplace hazards, and shutting down service facilities.
This global convergence has led to severe socio-economic disparities globally. Sports, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled, and there has been a widespread shortage of supply goods and it has been depleted due to panic buying.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed, either nationally or locally, and this has affected nearly 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of fear or hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other eastern and southeastern descents and those in areas with similar and significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduction in travel and closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of Hunan's seafood, and therefore the origin of the virus is believed to be endangered.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that was not closely related to the coronavirus of bats, the coronavirus associated with swamped cats, and the SARS-CoV. The person who was first identified with the symptoms was found to be sick on December 1, 2019.
Two-thirds of the initial cases reported in 2019 were found to be linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unproven report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case of a 55-year-old man in Hubei province who had been tracked as of 17 November 2019, could be the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that as the number of new cases decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, for the first time the number of new cases outside China was higher than in China.
Cases may have been reported to a much larger extent in lesser form, especially in cases where mild symptoms have been observed.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with cases aged 19 or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. According to estimates by United Kingdom's Chief Medical Adviser Patrick Valens, 60% of the British population must be infected before gaining mass immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those whose tests have been confirmed to be positive as per official rules.
As of March 23, no countries had tested more than 3% of their population, and the official policies of many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland were such that those with mild symptoms should not be tested.
According to a study published on March 16, an estimated 86% of people infected with COVID-19 in China had not been found until January 23, and undiagnosed individuals were the source of 79% of these infections.
In a statistical analysis published on March 30, it was estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the number of reported cases.
The primary estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
According to a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it could be 5.7.
Most of the people who have been infected with COVID-19 are recovering.
In those who do not, the period from the onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, and most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been reported due to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of the deaths in China were people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing health problems including heart disease and diabetes. Official figures of deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic usually relate to those who had tested positive for COVID as per official regulations.
Indeed, the death toll due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who were not tested, for example, at home, in the hospital, etc.
A little bit of information in Italy shows that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that, "We know [the number of confirmed deaths] is a low-profile estimate", a statement that is confirmed by incomplete reports of a decline in counts in the U.S. The decline in such a method occurred most often in the pandemic, as in 2009, the H1N1 swine flu first confirmed.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were reported outside China's mainland, each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories as of March 13 in all continents except Antarctica. Several methods are commonly used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and time and the number of tests conducted on it, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the time since the outbreak and the characteristics of the population; for example, age, gender and overall health are affected. The ratio of deaths to cases shows the number of total deaths in a given period of time divided by the number of cases diagnosed.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the death toll worldwide as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies by region.
The proportion of deaths in China decreased from 17.3% (in respect of those with symptoms from 1st to 10th January 2020) to 0.7% (in respect of those with symptoms after 1st February 2020). Other methods include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) with the disease.
These figures do not have a time bound and it tracks a particular population until the case is resolved.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate these figures for certain populations.
The Centers for Medicine, based on evidence from the University of Oxford, estimates that the overall mortality rate from the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The forecast for the top of this category is consistent with the first randomized trials of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the tests on the CFR.
The WHO is confident that this could be brought under control by the global pandemic.
The highest levels and maximum duration of this outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massey Bonnie of Penn State University states, "If not checked, the outbreak of the infection stops growing at a level and decreases when the host that is available to the disease is reduced."
It's just impossible to predict when that's going to happen."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that if all countries begin to follow WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, "it will end by June".
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV2 is likely to spread for one to two years.
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until the vaccine is available (the possibility of taking 18 months or more)".
William Shafner of Vanderbilt University noted that "it is impossible to completely destroy because the virus is so easily infected," so "it will become a seasonal disease and probably return every year."
The toxicity or severity of the return depends on the extent of the collective immunity and the conversion.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not comparatively specific and may not be visible in people who have been infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, swelling, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or shortness of breath, and severe skin bluishness.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed emergency symptoms; for example, shortness of breath, prolonged chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, waking up, pain in the face and bloating of the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical treatment if symptoms such as acute pneumonia, acute convulsions of respiratory distress, and lesions.
While some of those infected may not have symptoms, no medical symptoms may be detected, but the results of the tests may confirm the infection, researchers have advised that those who have had close contact with people who are confirmed to have the infection should be closely monitored and screened to rule out the possibility of infection.
Chinese people estimate that the proportion of people who have no symptoms can range from a little to 44%.
Normally, the period of onset of the actual disease when the virus enters the body (the time when symptoms appear) ranges from one to 14 days, usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of people who lost their sense of smell among those with COVID-19 was initially estimated to be 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spread are still being ascertained.
The disease is believed to have spread mainly due to close contact and small drops that may arise when coughing, sneezing or speaking, when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
During the study, it has been found that drops can travel from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) due to uncovered mouth.
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for long periods of time, even if the virus is not produced in the air.
These droplets can go into the mouth or nose of nearby people or be drawn to the lungs with breathing.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the secretion of the respiratory tract to be thinly sprayed and spread through the air.
If a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although he is concerned that he can spread through the debris, he is considered to be at a low risk.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through urine or oral infections. Even if the symptoms are likely to spread before and during the next stage of the disease, the virus is most likely to develop within the first three days after the symptoms appear.
Tests of people have been positive three days before symptoms start appearing and this indicates that it is possible to infect even before symptoms are large.
While there are only a small number of confirmed cases in the laboratory that do not show symptoms, some countries have detected infections without symptoms when searching for contact.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three other people. The virus survives on surfaces for a few hours to a few days.
In particular, the virus can be found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on carton for one day and on copper for up to four hours.
However, this may vary depending on humidity and temperature.Pet and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Although British authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with other surfaces where infected people are likely to have touched, there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
Acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus, first isolated from three individuals with pneumonia linked to a group of cases with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all the related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies due to the dissolving of its protective shield by domestic soap. SARS-CoV-2 is basically closely related to SARS CoV.
It is believed to be animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the corona virus forms a genetic group with the betacoronavirus, along with the subgenus Serbicovirus (Lineage B) with the variants derived from two bats.
Its overall genome level is 96% compatible with other bat-related coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between the viruses of the cavalry and the genome sequences of human viruses.
As of today, the entire genome has been found to contain 92% of the genome content of the pheromone virus and shared with SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pheromone is the same intermediate host.
The virus can be detected temporarily on the basis of symptoms, but is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan suggests that CT, although less accurate, is significantly more sensitive than PCR, and many of its imaging features are similar to other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued several RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory tract or blood samples.
The results will be available in a few hours.
Usually, this test is done by taking a sample of secrecy in the upper part of the nose throat, but it can also be used for a sample of secrecy in the throat.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Cellox in the U.S. has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
The specific image features on the radiograph and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not show symptoms have unproven peripheral ground glass opacities and do not have a ployral effusion.
International online information on the imaging of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
It is less accurate to use imagery to detect COVID-19 without PCR confirmation due to merging with infections such as adenovirus.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although imagery is less accurate to detect infection, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested that it should be considered as a means of testing in areas where the disease has spread.
Convolutional neural networks with radiographs and CTs based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the image characteristics of the virus.
Plans to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining your overall personal health, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth, using tissue while coughing or sneezing, and putting tissue directly into the trash.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Measures to maintain physical distancing have also been recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have restricted travel from areas where the outbreak has occurred to other areas or advised not to travel.
However, the virus has reached the level of social spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the society and some sections of the society do not know when and where they were infected. It is recommended that healthcare providers who are taking care of an infected person should follow the standard of care, care in case of contact and eye care. Tracking contacts is the key method for detecting the origin of the infection and preventing further infections.
The use of mobile phone location information by the Government for this purpose has raised concerns about private life and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement on the restriction of such a practice.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, a group of more than a dozen experts were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log in with other cellphones to keep the user's proximity to private life.
Then users get a message if they come in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. There are misconceptions about infection prevention, for example, cleaning the nose and swallowing is not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially when they come to the toilet or if they see their eyes swollen, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus dies from domestic soaps as the household soap breaks down its protective layer.
If water and soap are not readily available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.
It is recommended not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands.
Many solutions such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine can eliminate surface contamination (stainless steel surface can be disinfected using only one minute of disinfection).
Other solvents such as benzalconium and crohexidine are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place like a grocery or a nursing home, disinfect all such devices such as tablets, touch screens, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick persons in such areas.
Health institutions have recommended that people should cover their mouth and nose with a folded corner or tissue while coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are at risk of infection, as wearing a mask can limit the amount of drops that spread through the respiratory tract when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
There are many suggestions on how and when to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask is likely to reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if hand health is not appropriate."
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a mask only if healthy people are at risk, for example those who are taking care of people infected with COVID-19, they also agree that wearing a mask can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of unvaccinated masks made from cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks, especially for healthcare providers in the public, when they come in close contact with others (1 m (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks in public places or from going out without covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when visiting a grocery store.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Since mid-March, Taiwan has been producing 10 million masks per day, making it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask while going out and recommending masks at home to those who are not able to buy face masks.
Face masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves acts of controlling infection which are aimed at minimizing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include isolation, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres, or shopping centers.
People can apply this method by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching while greeting, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in areas where the outbreak has occurred.
U.S. government agencies and health departments cut the maximum number of people coming together abruptly from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 is not known in that province) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people in public places. Older people and those with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, disorders of governance, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems are being used to reduce the risk of chronic disease and disorders. The CDC is advising individuals to stay at home "in the care of others" as they are exposed to the increased risk of severe illness and disease.
The use of the term "social transfer" has resulted in people being completely isolated from each other in alternative ways rather than encouraging social contact. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
This includes recommendations for having sex with the person you are living with and who has not been infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected to have been infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health institutions have given proper instructions on how to self-isolate.Many governments have ordered or recommended isolation of the entire population living in areas where the infection has occurred.
Self-isolation is recommended for those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a high degree of infection are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last time they have been exposed.
Prevention or containment of the spread and containment of the spread are measures to control the outbreak.
Prevention of the spread is in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track, isolate, and plan measures to control the spread of the infection, and vaccinate against the spread of the disease among other populations.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, steps are taken towards curbing the disease: measures are taken to slow the spread and measures are taken to mitigate its impact on the health system and society.
Both measures can be combined to prevent transmission and reduce transmission.
To contain the spread, more extreme measures have to be taken to reduce the spread by reversing the global pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. As part of the planning of infectious diseases, efforts are being made to reduce the severity of the spread, which is called flattening of the spread chart.
This reduces the risk of stress on health services and gives time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-essential preventive measures that can manage outbreaks include hand hygiene, face masks and self-isolation, closure of schools, prohibition of mass gatherings, greater measures to encourage and encourage community interventions such as stricter lockdowns, and inclusion of those with the aim of physical distancing. Social measures aimed at preventing the spread of the virus, as well as measures aimed at preventing the spread of the virus, including personal protective measures related to the environment around the city.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has started conducting mass testing and isolation at the local level and has warned to be cautious about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who were self-isolated and penalized those who could not do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and punished for storing medical items. Simulating the United Kingdom and the United Nations are major challenges in curbing the spread of the disease (to slow down the spread of the pandemic, not to stop) and preventing (to reverse the spread of the pandemic).
Favorable plans to reduce the spread of the disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by 2/3rds and reduce deaths by half but can still lead to thousands of deaths and put enormous strain on health systems.
Preventing or suppressing the spread may be a priority but as long as the virus is spreading to the human community (or until the vaccine is available, if it occurs earlier), it needs to be continuously retained, otherwise the infection spreads again quickly after measures are relaxed.
Longer interventions to prevent or suppress the spread of the pandemic will result in economic and social harm.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop them that include testing the available drugs.
Taking cold medications, drinking fluids and resting at medical stores can help reduce symptoms.
The need for oxygen treatment, fluids from the veins, and respiratory aids can feel intense.
The consequences of using steroids can be even worse.
Research is being done to treat COVID-19 on many compounds that have already been approved to treat other viral diseases.
The WHO has also said that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Enhancing capacity and optimizing health care for COVID-19 patients is a fundamental measure to respond to the outbreak, the WHO said.
The European Divisional Office of the ECDC and WHO has issued guidelines to take the available resources for hospitals and primary healthcare to various levels including focus on laboratory services for COVID-19 tests, deletion of alternative methods if possible, isolate the COVID-19 positive patients and enhance the capacity of the staff by increasing the number of available ventilators and beds, etc.
There are many theories about where the first case (the so-called zero number of patients) might have been found.
The first case of the novel coronavirus can be traced to Wuhan, Hubei, China, on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei grew steadily.
They were mostly associated with the wholesale market of Hunan seafood, in which living animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals or in other words, the virus is native to the zoo. A group of pneumonia patients with unknown causes were reported on December 26 and were treated by Dr. Zhang Jishian Jiehan on December 27, who was treated at the Hubei Provincial Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital had warned their colleagues about the "SARS-Coronavirus."
Of these, eight doctors, including Lee Wenling, were warned by the police about spreading false rumours and another, namely, mother Fenn, was warned by her superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later issued a notice to the public and informed the WHO.
Many cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, which started investigations in early January. The number of cases was doubling almost every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
The virus spread to other provinces in China in early January 2020 and centrally due to migration caused by the Chinese New Year and Wuhan as a major transit hub and railway replacement.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latest official data shows that as of 20 January 2020, symptoms had already appeared in 6174 people. As of 26 March, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the world with the highest number of confirmed cases. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
At least one case has been reported in nearly 200 countries and territories.

Measures against the illegal trade of stockpiles and essentials from China and Italy have been successful, thereby avoiding acute food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Agricultural production in northern Italy did not experience much decline, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.

As a result, many airlines have cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flyby has been shut down.
The impact on the tourism industry has reached a level never seen before.
Many railway stations and passenger trains have been shut down.
It was during the Chinese New Year's holiday that the main travellers arrived.
Many of the large crowded events were canceled by national and local governments that included annual New Year's festivities, as well as private companies who personally closed their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many solar New Year's events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent a large number of people from coming together, including the Faridun City and traditional shrines in Beijing.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and parts have extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These parts represent 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has the highest levels of response to its infectious disease and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and cancelling New Year’s celebrations. The retail market has had a global impact and shops have been downtimed or shops have temporarily closed.
The number of retailers in Europe and Latin America has declined by 40%.
North America and the Middle East have declined by 50 to 60 percent.
As a result, the number of shopkeepers in the shopping centre fell by 33-43% in February compared to March.
World-wide shopping mall operators have made it mandatory to increase sanitation, install thermal scanners to monitor customers' temperatures, and cancel programs. According to the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America, the slowdown caused by this global pandemic has caused more than 14 to 22 million people in Latin America to be in extreme poverty than if they were in a world without this global partner.
When the pandemic hit its peak in Wuhan, China lost nearly 5 million jobs in January and February.
Nearly 300 million rural migrant workers in China are either stuck at home in the provinces or stuck in Hubei province. More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and they applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could go up to 32%. In India, the lockdown has led to the loss of nearly 10 million Indian migrant workers (those who get paid on a daily basis) out of the nearly 900 million who have lost jobs in the midst of the pandemic.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowances, and one million British workers applied for Universal Credit schemes. Nearly five million companies in Germany have sent their workers to work on short-term work plans called Kurtsarbyte, a government subsidy.
Germany's short-term repayment plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The fine arts and cultural traditions of the presentation have been deeply impacted by this global pandemic and have had a global impact on institutions and individuals - both employed and non - employed.
Institutions in the arts and culture sector have tried to continue their campaign (publicly funded with many), including to give the community an opportunity to experience cultural traditions, to protect their employees in public places, and to help artists whenever possible.
As of March 2020, various museums, galleries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events, and presentations were either cancelled or postponed.
In response, there has been a strong effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms, one of the fastest-growing forms of the disease, including religious services, major sporting events and other concerts, and cancellation of social events such as mafflies, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that religious week observances in Rome, which are the last week of Lent’s Christian repentance observance season, have been canceled.
Many bishops have asked older Christians to stay home instead of coming to Sunday prayers, some churches have made available church services through radio, online live broadcast or television, while some churches are offering drive-in worship options.
While the Roman Catholic bishops of Rome are closing their churches and chapels under the authority of the Bishops of Rome, and other religious institutions have also closed their services while the St. Peter's Square is empty, and have restricted the gathering of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurudwaras.
Iran's health ministry canceled Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and closed after midday, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from visiting religious sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused a massive disruption in the world's sports schedule since World War II.
Several important sports events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021. Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and poker matches have been postponed or canceled.
This has led many gamblers to play online, which has led to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Many groups in the music industry have postponed or canceled concerts, affecting the entertainment industry as well.
A number of major theatres, such as Broadway, have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have found ways to create and continue to share art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as a direct presentation of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" to present, distribute, and publish their work to artists.
There are many online memes on the topic of the coronavirus, many of which work to create and distract humor in this environment of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia, acute prejudice and racism have been observed against the Chinese people and those in the East Asian region as well as those in hotspots in Europe, America and other countries.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have reported cases of fear, suspicion and hatred.
In the February report (when most cases were still limited to China), records from ethnic groups around the world showed that Chinese people are either eligible for the virus to be transmitted or are receiving a fair retribution.
There has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
There is support for the Chinese people, both online and offline, and for those affected by the virus.
Italy, the first European country to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19 after the outbreak spread to new hotspot countries, may have also been subject to suspicion and xenophobia. People from other countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially joined together to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, <0x23>ChineseDontcomJapan has also been a topic of discussion on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in England and the United States have reported increasing incidents of racism and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," critics say the term is anti-racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters attacked a bus carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sadhari.
Students from northeastern India, who come from parts of the China border and study in important Indian cities, have been reported to have experienced persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, state-level president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said the Chinese people had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge."
Later, the Chinese embassy in Kolkata condemned the remarks, calling them "defective". Xenophobia and dynasticism against non-Chinese people in China have been fueled by companionship, where foreigners are described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "disposal."
The current paywalls have removed some or all of the paywalls for their coronavirus-related coverage.
Numerous scientific publications have provided free scientific research on the outbreak.
Some scientists have chosen a way to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for the respiratory virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods for detecting the presence of viruses and antibiotics produced in the response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is ensured by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the corona virus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to treat a recent or active infection.
Antibiotic testing can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of population closely.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very minor symptoms or people with no symptoms to mention.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the group in the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable information about the spread of the virus in their population until March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had conducted more than 3% of its population tests, and there was a huge gap in the number of tests conducted between the countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is also likely to be largely unreasonable in some countries.
The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be tested on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test can only be performed in the first week of life.
The virus can then disappear from the throat and the number of lungs continues to grow rapidly.
In the second week of testing of infected persons, the sample may be taken by the suction catheter through deep airways as an alternative, or the after-drying component may be used.
In January 2020, one of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the charity in Berlin that used real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the infrastructural component of the 250,000 test kits made available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England had also developed the test until 23 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck coronavirus).
This test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from China’s National Medical Products Administration (NCA) for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit in China.
One in three genetic testing in older versions of the test kits resulted in inconclusive results due to defective reagents and disruption of tests at the CDC in Atlanta; the result was that fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, the tests using two components were not considered convincing, and until then state-level and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
Tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. Professional laboratories in the US began testing in early March 2020.
On 5th March 2020, Lab Corp. announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 tests across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 tests available across the country.
No limitation was declared on the quantity; sample collection and processing should be done as per the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and developed by Vector, the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology in Russia.
The test was registered by the Federal Service on February 11, 2020 to monitor health care. It was noted that Mayo Clinic developed the test on March 12, 2020 to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a large-scale 3.5-hour trial, thus allowing one machine to conduct approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test Abbott's M2000 system; such authorization was previously granted by the FDA to Hologic, Labcorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for testing in approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid application technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can give definite results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 devices in the United States and Abbott is expected to increase production by as much as 50,000 tests per day. The monoclonal antibiotic test that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the novel coronavirus is expected to be developed in Taiwan, as the test is expected to be carried out in 15 to 20 minutes.
In a review of the information in March 2020, it was concluded that "While chest X-rays are less useful to diagnose at an early stage, the findings of CT [computered tomography] may appear before symptoms begin."
Typical features of the CT include accessory heterogeneous lateral distribution with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination, craziness, and aggregation develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan, at the present epicenter of the pandemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less characteristic as it incorporates other pneumonia and disease processes with many of its imaging features.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “Cit should not be used as a first-hand test to test or diagnose COVID-19”. The CDC recommends PCR for early screening by March 2020.
Antibiotics, including IgM and IgG, were produced as part of the immune response to the infection.
The tests can be used to detect the infection after approximately 7 days of the onset of symptoms or for some period of time, to determine the immune system and monitor the population. The tests can be done either in the Central Laboratory (CLT) or through Point of Care Testing (POCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test large-scale automated systems produced by certain processes over a specific period of time, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although several samples can be used to track the immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
A single sample of blood is usually obtained through the skin puncture for POCT.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for extraction prior to testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 components that gave instructions to the agency as needed and are therefore capable of delivering their antibiotic tests.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA has approved only one test under emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval from the European Community for their set of tests, through which IgG and IgA antibiotics can be detected in the background of viruses in blood samples.
The ability of the test is something that hundreds of samples can be tested in a few hours and therefore this test virus is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of RNA.
It is generally possible to detect antibiotics within 14 days after infection. As early as April, England did not find any set of antibiotic tests they purchased to be suitable enough to use.
Hong Kong has a plan in which suspects can stay at home, "Emergency Department will give a sample tube to the patient", they spit in it, they send it back, and they get the results of the test in a timely manner. The British NHS has indicated that they are studying a plan for testing at home for suspects who have not tested positive for COVID-19, by which they will not be able to contact others if they are hospitalized.
Drive through centres have helped South Korea to conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests than any other country. On March 2 in Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians projected that they had the ability to conduct approximately 12,000 tests a day in the rotating system and that 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When a doctor is asked to take a test, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-in tests have been conducted in several major cities.
The total number of tests conducted in Germany as of March 26, 2020, was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The laboratory's first survey found that a total of 4,83,295 samples were tested in the calendar up to this week of 12/2020 and including this week of 12/2020, which can be done in the month of February, and 33,491 samples were tested in the month of July, with more than 10,000 samples tested in the same day, and only 5,491 samples tested for SARS-CoV-2.
The construction was carried out within 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and this modelling has shown that if the testing capacity had not started on time, 47% more cases would have been seen in Hubei and the associated costs of handling quarantine would have been doubled.
Wuhan Lab has been followed up promptly by Huao-Yan Labs in a total of 12 cities in China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As on 4th March 2020, the total daily throughput was 50,000 tests per day. The multiplex design, published by Origami Eases, uses only 93 tests to test samples of 1,122 patients for COVID-19. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without a robotic liquid handler.
As of March, there has been a shortage of reactors and inadequate quantities for large-scale trials in the EU, the UK and the US.
This led some authors to start looking at the sample preparation protocol, which included heating the RNA genome for 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes for further testing. It was announced on March 31 that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more people for the coronavirus than any other country in its population.
This was in conjunction with the drive through capacity and the purchase of a bulk throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI to a population proportion (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to have such a large scale operation outside of China.
Various tests aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the US.
The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted Germanys action to send a set of manufacturing to low-income countries that do not have the resources to build their own set.
Germany’s action was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which led to pending available tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of the test kits during the early outbreak, and this country and Australia could not provide enough sets to meet the demand and test recommendations from health experts.
On the contrary, a large number of tests are available in South Korea, which has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has built up a large-scale testing capacity in private labs over the years.
On 16th March, the World Health Organization (WHO) ordered an extension of the testing programme as the best way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The large spread of the virus led to a large demand for testing, leaving behind hundreds of tests in private labs in the US and a shortage of swabs and chemical reactors.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the US, the test set developed by the CDC contained "defects"; then the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test set from a Chinese company called Shenzhen Bioezy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but its results were found to be incorrect.
The company clarified that the failure to collect samples or use the set correctly may have resulted in incorrect results.
Spain’s ministry said it would return the wrong results and replace them with a separate test set supplied by Shenzhen Bioezy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test sets purchased from China wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test sets from China which were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the set should be thrown in Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the set purchased by Turkey from China was "large" and they "did not use it." The UK bought 3.5 million test sets from China but announced in early April 2020 that it was not usable.
The testing, subsequent isolation of those who tested positive and tracking of those who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2, have yielded good results.
Researchers working in the city of Italy where the first Covid-19 death occurred in Italy made two rounds of tests on a population of approximately 3,400 people with a 10-day gap.
Nearly half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and those who were found were isolated.
With limited travel in social life, the new infection has been completely curtailed.
With aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries, and there have been no stringent restrictions to force closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
A number of events have been canceled and Singapore began advising citizens to stay at home since March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 at the time set for the holiday period.
The pandemic has been managed by several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, through aggressive tracking of contacts, bans on domestic travel, testing and quarantines, but a less aggressive lockdown.
The statistical study found that in countries where the fatality rate is higher than the fatality rate, the mortality rate is much lower, because these countries are most likely to have detected only mild or no-symptomatic individuals.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative samples to one of the 16 laboratories referred to by the World Health Organization for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 labs referred to, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The country's testing policy has an impact on the "positive percentage of tests" in the table below.
While other things remain the same, whether the symptoms are present or not, the tests will be more positive than those in the testing country of all citizens, which country only tests the hospitalised people.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, lubricants, microorganisms or other unwanted components.
Regular hand washing throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and dizziness, which spreads to my mouth.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a cold, for example, if they have not washed their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
The five most important times of the day when it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's tummy or after changing the laundry, before feeding the baby, before and after cooking food, or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry birds.
If there is no water or soap available, hands can be washed with ashes, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Cook before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After a change of laundry or after washing the laundry of the child.
When coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, food, or vegetation of an animal.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical care will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (microbes, viruses, or other microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but is also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
This includes lowering the infant mortality rate.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing methods could lead to minor improvements in children's height rises below five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior such as washing hands with soap.
These simple actions can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by about 50%.
The interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one third and can be compared to supplying pure water in a low-income area.
A 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea may be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only very effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, with a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five, causing an estimated 18 lakh deaths each year.
About 35 lakh children die of diarrhea and pneumonia each year.
According to UNICEF, using a built-in habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which reduces the number of deaths caused by diarrhea by nearly half and one-fourth of deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against the arrhythmias that spread through direct physical contact.
The harmful effect of hand washing is that continuous washing of hands can cause skin damage by drying the skin.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that too much hand washing can lead to a skin condition such as hand soreness, her abdomen rupture, which is known as hand soreness or skin disease, which is more commonly found in healthcare workers.
Washing your hands too often is also a symptom of OCD.
There are five important times during the day when it is important to wash my hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease by applying mouthwash: after going to the bathroom (sleeping, defecation), after washing the baby's tummy (after changing), before feeding the baby, before and after cooking food, or after raw meat, fish or poultry hands.
On other occasions, when proper hand washing techniques should be adopted to prevent the spread of the disease, the following should be followed, before and after treating cuts or other wounds; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing the nose; after touching animal faeces or handling animals and after touching the waste.
In many countries, there is a shortage of hand-washing soap.
In 2015, a study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest handwashing rate at 95 percent, the highest for handwashing in the United States at 77 percent, and the lowest in China at 23 percent.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of measures taken to improve children's health and education.
Hand washing with soap and fluoride twice a year is an integral part of the national programme.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microbes from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergent along with water.
The main activity of soap and detergent is to reduce the inhibition of solution and increase solubility.
Only water is insufficient to clean the skin because fats and proteins containing organic soil elements do not dissolve in water immediately.
However, purification is done by proper flow of water..
Due to the nature of our recycling, solid soaps are likely to have bacteria due to previous uses.
Some studies on the migration of bacteria by infectious solid soaps concluded that their migration was not possible due to the loss of bacteria due to foam.
The CDC continues to say that "liquid soap is preferable to not touch by hand for use".
Antibiotics have been widely used in people who are conscious about their health.
As of today, there is no evidence of any use of antiseptics or enzymes recommended for antibiotic-resistant in nature.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotics such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, although antibiotic stress resistant for disinfectant soaps have not been selected, it may not be as effective as stated.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protecting agents, refined formulations such as pH regulators may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), disease-resistant active benzoic acid and other skin conditioners (Corfed, Vitamins, Menthols, Plant Extracts) as well as enzymes.
Hot water that is comfortable to wash hands is not enough to kill germs.
The body temperature of the germs increases sharply (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, softer water is more effective than cold soapy water in extracting natural oils containing soil and germs from the hands.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that soft water is not effective in reducing microorganism load from the hands.
Hand Sanitizer or Hand Antiseptic is a hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubber, antiseptic hand rubber or hand sanitizer) began to become popular.
Most of them are in gel form or in wet liquid form like glycerin, with a thickening agent such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulation, or in face form to ease use and reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
Mild hydrogen-peroxide increases antibiotic activity. At least 60 to 90 percent of alcohol in hand sanitizers is an effective germ destroyer.
Alcohol kills rubber sanitizer germs, multi-drug resistant germs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain germs (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi
Alcohol rab sanitizer contains 70% alcohol and kills 99.97% on the hands in 30 seconds after applying (3.5 log reduction which is equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 log reduction) on some effective germs after 1 minute of application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against germs such as norovirus (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A lot of hand antiseptics or alcohol rubs should be used to completely clean both hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the space between all the fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel.
Wash your fingertips and rub them on both bottoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands after washing your hands when you see dirt.
The use of these agents is increasing on the basis of easy use and fast killing of micro-organisms; however, they should not act as a replacement for hand washing properly if soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based sanitizers can make the skin dry, so add skin softeners and/or moisturizers.
This formula can reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol by adding glycerin and/or other skin softening substances.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients in clinical trials reduce skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergic contact is rarely found in dermatitis, contact gallbladder syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or substances present in hand rubbish.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, toxic contact led to a lower tendency to cause skin ailments.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of pathogens because the pathogens live on the hands.
The efficiency of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends on a very large number of components and formulations, and has historically surpassed alcohol and alcohol rubbish to a significant extent.
Recently, the formulations that use benzylconium chloride have shown consistent and stored antibiotic activity, unlike alcohol, where after repeated use there has been a decrease in efficiency, may be due to a progressive adverse skin reaction.
Many people in low-income groups do not have access to soap and use ash and soil.
The ash and soil may be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it will increase the spread of the disease rather than decrease.
Soil like soap is also a disinfectant because when soil comes in contact with water, an alkaline solution is formed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended using ashes or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
Precise hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because the permanent basin may be contaminated, and the water temperature did not seem to make much of a difference.
Apply a large amount of soap, rub it on the hands, put it on the back of the hands, in the fingers, under the nails, and prepare its face.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more regularly when using soap than just plain water.
Hold your hand for at least 20 seconds.
Bleaching creates friction, which leads to the removal of germs on the skin and the removal of more germs due to longer rinsing.
Wash your hands under running water.
Washing your hands in the basement can lead to hand-washing.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or allow the air to dry out.
Wet and wet hands are quickly contaminated again. The thumb, wrist, fingernails, and lower parts of the nails are the most commonly thrown away areas when washing hands.
Artificial nails and semi-articulated nails can support microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended so that the hands do not dry; dry skin can cause damage to the skin, which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made for the convenience of hand washing in places where tap water and/or soap are not available e.g. in developing countries, if required, pouring water from a hanging jerrycan or crab with proper holes and/or using ash. In the circumstances of limited water supply (such as in developing countries schools or rural areas) - other options of "tipple taps",
Tippi tap is a simple technique in which a can is hung with a rope to pour a little water on the hand and soap and has a leg-movable lever.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is little debate about the most effective type of drying in public washrooms.
An increasing amount of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than electric hand dryers in many washrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster conducted a study to compare the sanitation levels offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers, and the paper industry sponsored the study.
After washing hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194 per cent, while the number on the bottom increased by 254 per cent.
After drying by Jet Air Dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42% and on the bottom by 15%.
After washing hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and on the bottom by 77%. As a result of each type of drying method, scientists conducted tests to check whether the other washroom users and the washroom environment are likely to be polluted.
A jet air dryer that throws air out of the unit at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hands and units and polluting the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters long.
With the use of a hot air dryer, microorganisms spread from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
No significant prevalence was observed due to paper towels. In a study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005, different hand turning methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
In travel, hand-washing wipes are an option when soap and water are not available.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made it mandatory to wash his hands after discovering his effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent disease in the environment of the hospital.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
A study showed that their use reduced the incidence of infection.
Medical hand washing is a minimum of 15 seconds, in which a large amount of soap and water or gel is used to foam and rinse every part of the hand.
Hands should be clasped together.
If there is a dirt in the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
It is important to wash your hands and wipe with a clean towel so that germs can remain in the water on your hands.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and to open the exit door if necessary)
This can lead to hand-washing.
In health care, the purpose of washing hands is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains unacceptable in many medical environments, where a large number of doctors and nurses tend to forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple methods can reduce catheter-related blood flow by 66%. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published an ideal hand-washing and hand-washing guide in the healthcare sector.
Guidelines on hand hygiene can also be found on their website for public comments.
Whitby and others had compiled the relevant review.
If a demonstration of regular compliance is required, professional tools can measure and standardize hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five minutes to wash your hands.
If there is a connection between the blood and the body
Prior to the demolition, and
After taking care of the patient. Antiseptic chemicals are added to the soap ("medicine" or "microbial antibacterial" soap) to kill the action in the hand washing liquid.
Such an act of killing may be required before surgery or at a place where antibiotic-resistant organisms are in large quantities, for surgical operation, taps that can be turned on and off without touching hands, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying after washing hands, and other equipment required for cleaning under the brush and fingernails.
All the ornaments should be removed.
For this procedure, it is usually necessary to wash the part from the hand and wrist to the corner for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long (10 minutes).
When washing, the water from the wrist to the side of the elbow should be avoided to go back to the hands.
After hand washing is complete, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and the surgical gown is mounted on the body.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of the sick person or to use hand germicides.
For the control of the hospital's staphylococcal infection, it was found that the biggest benefit of hand washing comes from the first 20% washing and when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%, the benefit of a little more.
Washing your hands with simple antibacterial soaps is more than three times the rate of bacterial infection in food. For every 30 seconds, an alcohol-based solution compared to hand washing with antimicrobial soaps and hand washing with antimicrobial soaps, it was found that 26 per cent of antimicrobial soaps were found to be less effective than antimicrobial soaps.
But to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium from hard seedlings on hands, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based liquids. Intervention to improve hand health in a healthcare setting can train employees to wash their hands, make them more aware of the presence of alcohol-based liquids on hands, and make them available to staff and staff in writing.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is being considered as an inexpensive and necessary tool for achieving good health and good nutrition.
But the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces have made it a challenge to achieve a universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is a shortage of hand-washing taps near every private or public toilet, even though there are cheaper options to set up hand-washing spaces.
However, lowering the amount of hand washing can also be the result of dead habits than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and award of hand washing with soap can have an impact on policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing and alter the long-term behaviour of the population.
For this to be implemented effectively, monitoring and evaluation is required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that a society-based approach to increasing hand washing in LMICs makes it effective, while social marketing initiatives make it less effective. An example that encourages hand washing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to make simple, affordable solutions to ensure students wash their hands with soap, along with other necessities of hygiene.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can eventually go from one to three stars.
It may be a part of the initiative to promote hand washing to reduce disease and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising initiative that seeks to change behaviour. UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019-20.
Some studies have taken into account the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Daly.
But, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly cheaper than other interventions in water and sanitation.
For those in particularly vulnerable conditions, such as recently-born mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals - first two pioneers working on hand hygiene in the mid-19th century recognized the importance of hand washing for human health: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the "English founder of modern nursing" Florence Nightingale.
At that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by the smell of Miyamas.
In 1980, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. more actively encouraged hand washing as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have created awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, public toilets and office buildings and toilets on the plane floor were placed next to hand washing sinks with murals showing "the right technique for hand washing."
Washing one's hands is the expression of one's reluctance to take responsibility for something or to share its complexities.
This originates from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pantius Pilate washes his hands about the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but in some English societies the phrase came with more widespread use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her fictitious stains in an attempt to show her criminal conscience about the crimes she committed and her husband committed.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others when they are reminded of or contemplated of immoral practices and tend to attach greater importance to the means of washing their hands.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "clean" compensatory actions such as volunteering.
Religions are asked to wash their hands for both hygiene and symbolic reasons. Using water to wash their hands, but not using soap, is a part of the ritual of washing their hands, which includes the practices of the Baha'i, the Hindu, the Tequilahs and the Netila, the Lavabo of Christianity and the Wudu of Islam. Religions are asked to wash their hands especially for hygiene after certain actions.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Workplace Hazard Control due to COVID-19
Workplace Hazard Control due to COVID-19 is an application of Occupational Safety and Health Practices to control the threat posed by Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
Proper workplace risk control depends on the workplace and the nature of the work, the source of the infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of every worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-infection work has minimal business contact with people and colleagues, including those who recommend original infection prevention measures, hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular workplace hygiene and sterilization.
Work at moderate infection risk includes activities that require high or close contact with people who are not aware of or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected by an ongoing community infection or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, densely populated areas and some large retail outlets.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures, risk control for the group includes using high-capacity air-filters, maintaining air-conditioning, using sneaze guards, and personal protective equipment available to a person who is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHO considers health workers and crematorium staff who have been exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 infection as high risk of infection, in which the worker is processing aerosols or is collecting or handling samples of a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Risk controls suitable for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal safety equipment suitable for that particular task.
COVID-19 can have a lot of impact on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to fear of illness, needing to be monitored by others, or fear of a possible infection.
In both the sense of what goods are in demand and the way to get those goods, the commercial patterns may change (such as buying or distributing when less crowded or buying through drive-through services).
Finally, the movement of goods from the heavily impacted geographical areas due to COVID-19 can be disrupted. Preparation and response plan for infectious diseases can be used for protective measures.
Addressing various workplace and work-related risk levels, these include sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors and risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the necessary controls to address those risks and the contingency plans for situations that may arise due to outbreaks.
Preparation and response planning for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Objectives for an outbreak response include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of health complications, maintaining professional mobility, and minimizing adverse effects on others in their supply chains.
The seriousness of the disease affects the response of the communities in which the business is located.
There is a hierarchy of widely used risk controls in occupational safety and health to determine group effectiveness of risk controls.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and ultimately personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include segregation of employees from work-related risks without relying on the behaviour of the worker and may be the cheapest way to implement this.
Administrative controls are those changes in action policies or procedures that require action by a worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain infections.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the risk to the worker, it should be fitted according to usage (e.g., respirators) and properly put in, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and it should be properly removed, cleaned and kept dry or properly disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-infection jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other partners.
It is recommended to adopt basic infection prevention measures for all types of workplaces, including upper and full hand washing, inducing workers to stay at home if they are sick, including rinsing their mouths while coughing and sneezing, adhering to respiratory etiquette, providing access to tissue paper and sewage buckets, regular use of equipment from telecommunication or other shifts, if required.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is an important step in protecting workplace workers, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have severe respiratory symptoms should stay at home for at least 24 hours without taking any other medication that reduces or changes symptoms.
According to the OSHA, moderate infection risk works include jobs for people who are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but who have recently travelled internationally due to community transmission around the commercial area or a person who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in close proximity (six feet from people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2).
These include workers who have come in contact with the general public, such as schools, densely populated workplaces, and some large retail sales centers, which have to do training, which have to do in-house, which have to do in-house, and which have to do in-house training, which have to do in-house, which have to do in-house training, and which have to do in-house training, which have to do in-house training, and which have to do in-house training, which to do in-house, which to do in-house, and in-house, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to do, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which to, which, which to, which to, which to, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, are, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, is high, are, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, are, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, are, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, are, are, are, are, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which
The risk group workers rarely need to use respirators.
If a person falls ill on a plane, the proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to serve the sick person and asking the sick person to give a face mask or cover their mouth and nose with tissue paper while coughing or sneezing.
While serving a sick passenger or touching his or her bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces, it is necessary to wear disposable medical gloves and if the sick passenger has a fever, constant coughing or difficulty breathing, the cabin crew must wear additional personal protective equipment.
Disposal of gloves and other disposable items in a biologically endangered bag and then the infected space must be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including sailing vessels and other passenger vessels, delaying travel when sick in risk controls and self-isolating when there is a fever on the ship or if other symptoms are found.
Ideally, there is a need for medical follow-up in the isolation room. Whether an infected person is found in schools and child care centres or not, the CDC recommends a temporary closure for hygiene and disinfection.
Where there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as suspending other major ceremonies, including field trips, gatherings and physical education or eating in prayer classes or eateries, increasing the distance between desks, changing the times of coming and going, limiting unnecessary visitors, and setting up a separate health center space for children with flu-like symptoms.
While there is a significant contagion in the local community, schools may be considered to be closed for longer periods of time, with a social distancing strategy. The CDC considers that the enforcement staff of the law, who do routine daily work, are less likely to be at immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact other persons infected with COVID-19 or who are susceptible to infection are recommended to follow the guidelines along with appropriate personal protective equipment, similar to emergency medical techniques.
If close contact occurs during the period of care, employees should clean and disinfect using household cleaning sprays or wipes before re-using their duty belts and gears, and follow the standard procedure for disinfection and washing of used PPE for a controlled period, as well as for disposal of used PPE.
OSHA considers certain staff in health care and mortuary to be at high or high risk of infection.
High risk of infection includes healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 are at a higher risk of infection if they are undergoing aerosol manufacturing procedures or collecting or handling samples from such patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental systems, and examinations or invasive sample collections.
Hospitals at high risk of infection include staff engaged in preparation of dead bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 patients at the time of death; if they perform post-mortems, they are at risk of high infection. These risk groups include isolation classes for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including those undergoing extra-engineered aerosol manufacturing processes.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and bathroom structures.
There are three levels of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, who are suspected of COVID-19, be quarantined in a separate waiting room. Along with other PPEs, the OSHA recommends that employees who are working within 6 feet of those who are known or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection should use respiratory devices.
In the United States, NIOSH approved N95 respirator masks or better respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory protectors can provide better protection and make employees feel more comfortable. The WHO does not recommend protecting the entire body, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through other secretions of the body.
The WHO recommends that only those who are screened at the entry point should wear a surgical mask.
The WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, gowns and gloves for staff who are collecting, caring for, or transporting respiratory samples of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 without any aerosol-making procedures.
If the aerosol-making process is carried out, use N95 or FFP2 respiratory protectors instead of surgical masks.
As the global supply of PPE is inadequate, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows, through which PPE can be accessed directly to healthcare providers in COVID-19 patients classrooms using only the essential PPE for specific work, recommends reducing the need for the use of PPE masks for those who are not in symmetry, and recommends the use of a single respirator without side-effects while serving a number of patients who have been diagnosed with the same symptoms.

We are in a very difficult situation this month.
"The COVID-19 world is a global issue that makes it clear that humanity is interconnected and that we have responsibilities towards each other.
We don't have any previous evidence of this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation, and building a group at the heart of our organization.
The remarkable authentication of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with amazing people is the goodwill and care that all of our colleagues see through email, phone and chat.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to call you my friend.
Last week, someone praised me for my work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to read Wikipedia at the moment and how powerful a symbol of this vital resource is to be online and available to all.
It's because of your work that you've made it possible to keep this site up-to-date, or pay our colleagues, or keep your group safe.
The world needs more information from Wikipedia now than ever before.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
In the coming weeks, we will begin to see some significant changes in how we work together due to the importance of this mission and your role in it.
Changes in our work and schedule.
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team held a meeting last night to discuss its outlook and schedule in the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what response would be appropriate to what we are facing and the best way to sustain the institution during this period.
We look forward to working hard to reduce stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you want to dial again, it doesn't matter.
For all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Our daily work is expected to be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can use this campaign.
However, the world is not predictable right now and if you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
You don’t have to say that, but we’re saying it.
You don't need a sick leave or a PTO - just tell your manager and help your team to make adjustments to the calendar and schedule, so as to ensure that important parts of the work are completed.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Brian at T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and take precautions to be properly taken care of by the management.)
Full-time employees will be paid.
We have already said and reaffirm our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working hours.
If you're sick and can't work, you're sick.
If you want to work, we can help you.
Many people use it as a way of expressing their feelings about the world around us.
Especially during a period like this, what you do will be surprisingly beneficial.
Again, you have to take care of yourself.
We ask that you communicate with your managers so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Fundraising Teams (some others) do important work, which may require additional help.
We will begin the process with all departments to evaluate the current targets and focus on assisting the essentials for our mission.
There is a lot of work to be done for all of us, we will focus only on the most important projects.
If you work slowly, it won't break.
Once the world came together, we didn't have a plan to "work twice the time to complete the work."
You don't have to work extra hours to get the job done.
We accept that the situation has changed and we will work to set new goals and schedules when appropriate.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
While adjusting expectations about your new realistic and daily work time, we aim to adjust the timeline for the delivery of your 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will allow employees more time to prepare a budget to prioritize important tasks, self-care and care for their loved ones, who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This expansion of the timeline will greatly reduce the ongoing planning workload and stress throughout the organization.
We will be presenting our proposal to the Board next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will update our representatives and teams for further action.
Thank you to the community for your leadership.
Office status, infection and hygiene
Last week, we learned that one of our employees in the SF-area is likely to have contracted the COVID-19 virus.
Yet, with extreme caution, we have appointed an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all areas of San Francisco's offices.
They use high-quality anti-virus solutions used in hospitals to sterilize every surface, as well as the lobby, and the shores of the elevator that come to our floors.
This building uses such products and adopts its own precautionary measures which help in the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that when we decide to return, these offices will be ready to work.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork area, where with us and all other DC-area employees, their COVID-19 solutions have been shared.
Last week, our DC office was transformed into a completely remote set-up in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC region know, we are discussing renting a place in Brooklyn.
This is going on, but we can get into it.
Some of our partners are working remotely for the first time.
Colleagues who have worked remotely for a long time know that this will be just an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of your meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, consider how they can be divided into several days.
Explain the agenda of the meeting clearly and send the materials to them in advance.
Make this video by default with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connectivity.
To facilitate each meeting, ask someone to lead her, who will monitor the chat for questions asked, check the list of speakers, and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes in collaboration with each other).
Send an e-mail to the technical support team if you need help.
Use your money to pay for the loss.
Join the <0x23>remoteries channel in 'Slack' to talk to your colleagues about the assigned work.
The Human Resource Operations Team is looking at 'Webinar Based Economics' to help in the growth of the work that has been delivered to the entire organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to postpone Wikimedia-funded mass gatherings such as "Editathons," until the WHO announces an end to the pandemic.
We told them that we had learnt that our request for stay and other restrictions would make it impossible for them to meet their agreed grant-in-aid, and also that no one would be punished for delaying and changing that goal.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
A common feeling of the entire global community is both sad but at the same time pleasant with this clarity and the ability to focus on our own community, Wikimedia, and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to provide the community with space to monitor these impacts and track our communication with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19-related issues.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are here to help and help as much as possible.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information through this email and get other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office-Wiki.
The CRT will keep the pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees, who currently live in countries that are severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, ceremonies, a major workflow, or considered challenges, or need help with anything else, don't hesitate to notify the CRT and work with them.
We are here to help, support and establish contacts if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive content near you, please send an email to the Director of Human Resources Global Operations, Brian Junn.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment and obligation to our work.
Instead, they have to officially acknowledge that at this point our work and responsibilities will need to be pursued in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that, in our opinion, are necessary to cooperate with each other, so that we can continue to work, provide them with the needs they need, and provide them with the services they depend on.
When the time comes, we will be able to help you.
Now, it is time to cooperate with each other and create space for important tasks, which will be dealt with in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so you need to take care of yourself and your family, so that you can give your best when you need it.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face.
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Joel L., Linette L. Ryan M., and Tony S.). And the rest of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jamie V., Jenine U, Lisa S., Robin A. Ryan M., and Toby
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys and intestinal cells.
ACE2 resists the action of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing the level of angiotensin(1-7), and is therefore a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular and cardiovascular diseases. For some corona viruses, ACE2 serves as the entry point for penetration into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing methylenzyme that is located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal collateral renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type of mucous skin protein that is activated by the action of your enzyme on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extra-cellular domain of ACE2 is broken down by another transmembrane called sheds and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most of the organs: the lung type II is attached to the alveolar cell membrane, the small intestinal enterocytes, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, and the smooth muscles of the arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a resistance to ACE.
ACE Angiotensin I allows the hormone to enter the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
In return, ACE2 breaks down carboxyl-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it in the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Prog-Val-Hyr-Tyr).
[des-Arg9] - Many other peptides, including bradykinine, aphelin, neurotensin, dinorephine A and ghrelin, can break down ACE2.
Neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 also regulates the circulation of the screen and is involved in heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19).
Interestingly, the bonding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the surface of cells with the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis and the transfer of both viruses and enzymes to the endosome located in the cells.
The entry process also requires the host Serene Protease TMPRSS2 to prioritise the S protein, the prevention of which is ongoing as a potential treatment in the current investigation. This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in cells will help fight infection.
However, many professional organizations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
Apart from this, patients who had a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, were reduced in their risk of being treated with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors are less strong than the overall risk of pneumonia, in terms of reducing the mortality associated with pneumonia, but the use of ACE was related.
Recombinant Human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for severe lung injury, and this led to improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours and it takes 30 minutes to start and 24 hours to finish.
Many findings show that rhACE2 can be a promising drug for people with intolerance to diseases with high levels of classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or imbalanced angiotensin. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b-COVID-19 apps are software applications in mobiles, designed to help communicate as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person ("Contact") who has been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications were developed and proposed, including authoritative government support, in some provinces and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed to create contact tracing apps.
There have been concerns about privacy, especially in systems that track the geographic location of the app users.
The less intrusive options include using a blue tooth signal to log in with other cell phones of the user.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that such Bluetooth-based apps will be integrated to support directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
The Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay in China, has launched an app that will allow citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, there is an app called Trace Together.
The app was developed from a local IT community and was made available as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched the Blue Tooth-based App "Stop Corona" to contact potentially infected individuals and respond quickly to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app is expected to be approved by Google Play Store and Apple App Store by April 14, 2020.
The app is in an advanced stage of development and the government said on April 12 that it will be available in a few weeks. A similar app is being rolled out in Ireland and in France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s Trace Tudor and Blue Tooth Protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure that COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including mis-positives and low probability of effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to a very small proportion of the population.
While expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, restricting it only to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Confidentiality campaigners expressed strong concern over the impact of large-scale surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially regarding whether or not the infrastructure to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The Institutions promulgated eight conditions for Government projects:
It must be "lawful, necessary and certified."
Expansion of monitoring and monitoring will have to be Sunset Clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the causes of COVID-19.
Information security and anonymity have to be protected and shown to be protected on the basis of supply;
It is necessary to avoid acute discrimination and neglect due to digital surveillance;
The sharing of information with third parties should be defined in the Act;
The right of citizens to protect against abuse and to respond to abuse;
Significant participation of all “related stakeholders” including public health experts and neglected groups is required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of permanently removing the tracking system from their device operating system once the need for a tracking system is over.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps that eliminate the ability to avoid tracking the need to download apps.
Network-based tracking has been approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access personal location data; many privacy protected systems have been created that only use central servers for intercommunication.
In South Korea, a system was used to perform contact tracing that was not based on the app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system aggregated various tracking information, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and aggregated potentially infected individuals to create notices through text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available, something that was allowed, due to the far-reaching changes in the information privacy law following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, considered both central and privacy-protected systems.
Details have not been announced as of April 6, 2020.
Privacy - Protected Contact tracing is a well-established concept, with at least research material from 2013 onwards. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen experts had been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log in with other cell phones that are user-friendly.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that involves both centralized and decentralized methods and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy - Finding Proximity (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, FKA Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Protocols and Other Contact Tracking Devices (PAA) for Mobile.
In these protocols, the identifiable personal data never leaves the device and is on all matching devices.
Privacy groups in the MIT Media Lab are developing SafePath, a platform to use privacy-protected techniques when collecting or using a location or path intersection to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace, a private technology development company created by Enigma MPC, which was originally established in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace allows users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of that data, using secure data hardware technology.
The Global TCN Alliance was formed on 5 April 2020 by groups that had come together around the same approach and mainly overlapping protocols and aimed at reducing fragmentation, retrieving, and enabling the efficiency of alerting apps, which is a key aspect of the broader adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol open source used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy cryptography, which they claim will maintain privacy.
He also outlined some of the technologies used in the project.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be rolled out in three phases:
Roll out tools to enable governments to create governmental secrecy - protect coronavirus tracing apps.
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS, AndroidGoogle and Apple is planned to address continued monitoring issues by distributing the system through the first operating system updates and eliminating the threat once again in the same way.
B. Drug Repository (also known as drug reappraisal, re-profiling, retasking, or therapeutic switching) is a drug originally approved for the treatment of a disease or other disease.
This is the only type of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma infections for vaccine and recombination. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 dragable proteins, each of which has several associated binding locations.
The analysis of such bonding places provides an opportunity to develop antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papen-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicalase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussain A. A. and others studied various candidate compounds followed by finding and analyzing the similarity of its appearance with the approved drug so that it could be recommended in the clinical study plan by developing a SARS-CoV-2 anti-cancer drug in their preclinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-hypertensive drug that is used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the four drugs that will be studied as part of the Solidarity Clinical Trials would contain chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be conducted from March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The FDA's approval for these treatments has not been obtained through clinical trial procedures and has been authorized under the EUA only for those patients who have been admitted to the hospital but cannot receive treatment under clinical trials.
"The use, quantity, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been certified," the CDC said.
The drug is used when there is "no other option left" by the doctors.
A small study was conducted by the Turkish research team in Istanbul with the use of chloroquine along with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A large number of studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and quality of hydroxychloroquine is being tested by NYU Langon Medical School as a preventive measure.
Favipiravir has been claimed to be "fully effective" in Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen.
While 35 patients tested negative in 4 days in Shenzhen, the duration of the disease was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half of the patients received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Institute reminded the public that the present quantities in support of the drug are inadequate and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for storage, and distribute it to university hospitals with the help of the Army, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to a South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe had a formal conversation with the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in patients with severe illness because the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to get pregnant.
A study on Lopinavir/Retonavir (Caletra) in which a joint study of antiviral lopinavir and Retonavir showed "no benefit"
The drug was developed to prevent the reproduction of HIV by binding with the proteins.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to improve these drugs and find a protein-binding compound for SARS-CoV-2. There has been a scientific controversy over the use of HIV/AIDS drugs for new purposes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retonavir in the Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Welded Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus infection. Welded Sciences then discovered that Remdesivir had anti-physical anti-, pneumo-, paramixo-, and anti-coronavirus anti-viral antiviral agents.
One of the problems in antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations that result in more serious diseases and infections.
Some pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir is likely to have high genetic resistance to resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, with two being conducted at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild illness and the other for people with severe illness.
Three clinical trials are underway for patients with severe COVID-19 and those admitted to hospital; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing azithromycin on March 24.
Japan's National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) has planned to conduct a clinical trial of a corticosteroid that is inhaled for Tizen's Alvesco (Ciclosonide) asthma to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
Phase II trials on Angiotensin-conversion Vickers 2, which will include 200 of the critically ill patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria.
Colchicine's role in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 is currently being studied by researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada.
The study, called CallCorona, is recruiting 6,000 adults with mild symptoms that are diagnosed with COVID-19 and do not require hospitalization, aged 40 or older.
Pregnant or lactating mothers as well as women who do not follow the resultant contraceptive method are not eligible.
A variety of anti-cloning tests are being conducted in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular weight is being used to treat patients, which encourages medical institutions in Italy to publish guidelines.
On April 14, Italy announced a multi-centric study of 300 patients to research the preventive and therapeutic doses of anoxaparin sodium.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, more scientific attention is being paid to the use of the antiviral drugs that were previously approved by MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus partners for a new purpose.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 as per the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Some antibiotics were found to be usable for the new purpose of treatment on COVID-19:
Tosilizumab (IL-6-anti-receptor): Approved by China
There are also tests in China and Italy and Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID-19.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a fictitious vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although clinical trials of any vaccine have not been completed, many efforts are underway to develop such vaccines.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is not expected to be available before 18 months of age.
Phase I safety studies were conducted on five vaccine candidates in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The outbreak in the world in 2020 has led to a massive investment and research to produce vaccines.
Many organizations are using the published genome to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the requirements for the CEPI initiative to develop the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, quantum planning and global reach.
In April 2020, CEPI scientists were informed that research and development was underway on 10 different technology platforms in early 2020 to produce an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of Phase I security studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Cancino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
According to the CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the forefront of development, confirming 78 projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 have been released, with very little information being made public (assuming it is planned or planned).
Phase I-II trials have carried out primary testing of safety and immunity and are usually randomized, placebo controlled and in many places to ensure accurate, qualitative quantities.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a controlled group, and the vaccine's quality is tested to prevent disease and monitor for side effects after giving adequate doses.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 vaccines have not yet been evaluated in humans (still "preclinical" research is underway).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was exploring a potential molecular clamps vaccine that would lead to a genetic improvement in the virus's proteins and induce a immune response.

In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cloud computing resources, along with Amazon, Microsoft and Google, combined resources from the United Nations government, industry and three universities to access IBM's supercomputer.
Some vaccines have adverse effects, which can also be called unintended consequences.
This means that in addition to preventing the disease, it can also have other benefits.
A total of 4,170 health care workers will be recruited for a randomized trial in Australia.
The vaccine being developed is likely to be neither safe nor effective.
Previous research to evaluate the quality of the vaccine on COVID-19 specific animals, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals and primates other than humans, suggests the need for biosafety-level 3 controller measures and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures for handling live viruses.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animals other than humans.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine for SARS or safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, finding and developing novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority task for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is also no proven vaccine for MERS.
When MERS became more dominant, it was believed that ongoing SARS research would provide a useful model for finding vaccines and medications for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, phase I clinical trials of one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine had been completed in humans, and work was underway on the other three vaccines, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-Gamvac), and one MVA-vectored (MVAS-V).
The post on social media has triggered speculation that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and the vaccine is already available.
The patents, which have emerged as evidence from various posts on social media, refer to the genetic sequence and existing patents for other coronavirus-type vaccines like the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.
Other symptoms can be fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing and abdominal pain.
The duration of symptoms is usually five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
Most of the patients show mild symptoms, while some of the patients have increased disease, resulting in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As on 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and landslides, of which 153,000 died.
More than 5,68,000 people have recovered from the disease, mainly through direct contact with people, often through coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
When exhaled, these veins are thrown out and fall to the ground or to the surface, they do not carry the infection over a long distance.
People can also get infected by touching their eyes, nose and mouth by touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus lives on any surface for 72 hours.
The first three days after symptoms begin to appear are highly infectious, but can also be transmitted before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The real-time reverse transcription of nasopharyngeal fluid is a standard method of diagnosing polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Those suspected of being infected with the virus are advised to wear masks.
The general public is given different advice on using masks, some officials oppose the use of masks, while some advise to use it and some say it is necessary to use it.
There is currently no specific anti-virus treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.
The WHO has reported that the majority of countries in all six regions have been infected with the disease.
Patients infected with the virus sometimes have no symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Contingency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or stress in the chest, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and nausea on the face and lips; it is advisable to go to the hospital immediately if these symptoms are detected.
Mild symptoms can include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nose rash or sore throat.
In some patients, symptoms of anaemia were less frequent, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
In some patients in China, early symptoms of chest pain and heart palpitations were observed.
In some patients, pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death have been reported.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some people it can be two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of the patients who developed symptoms appeared 11.5 days after infection. Reports show that not all infected patients develop symptoms.
The role of non-symptomatic carriers in the transmission is not yet clear; however, they are said to be involved in the transmission of the disease at an early stage.
While the number of infected patients who did not show symptoms is not yet known and the study is underway, 20% of the confirmed cases from the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) have not been reported to the hospital till now.
China's National Health Commission began inclusion of non-symptomatic patients in daily cases from April 1; out of 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of diagnosis.
Both red and red have a lot of viruses.
It's more common to speak out than to speak out loud.
According to a study conducted in Singapore, the tushar can travel up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) away due to uncovered mouth.
Although the virus does not originate from the air, the National Academy of Sciences has predicted its bioaerosol transmission and found positive virus RNA in samples taken from gas collectors located outside people's homes.
Some medical procedures, such as the insertion of a tube into the body and resumption of blood vessel activity, can cause the discharge to fly through the respiratory tract and thus spread through the air.
When there is a concern about the spread of the virus by the fetus, the risk is considered low, and people who have symptoms are most likely to be infected with the virus.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, but it can infect two to three people from one person.
The virus has been found on the surface of plastic and steel (AISI 304) for three days and on the surface of 99% copper for four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the environment and varies accordingly.
Proper use of soaps and detergents can be effective; soap products degrade the thick protective layer of the virus, inactivate it and distinguish it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other remedies, such as benzacconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a type of surgical sterilization) are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, redness samples were taken within two days after hospitalization.
Of the six patients, five were found to have the highest number of pathogens in the first sample and the sixth were found to have the highest number of pathogens in the second day of the trial.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus with hypertensive respiratory symptoms. It was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory disease center in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are reflected in the coronavirus associated with it in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soaps that form our protected bubble. The origin of the virus is closely related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs, as the virus is transmitted through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to the original cells, which are abundant in the second type of cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called 'spike' to be attached to ACE2 and enter the original cells.
12% of hospitalized patients in China, Wuhan, have acute heart disease and are frequently found in serious illnesses.
The symptoms of acute heart injury are largely due to the inflammatory response of the body system during the spread of the disease and a loss of immunity, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with the receptors of ACE2 in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Examples of blood clotting (31%) and blood clotting in the veins (25 percent) have been found in severe cases of COVID-19. They may have been associated with untreated pathogens. Their lungs have been found to be decomposed (defeated ulcer damage) from the autopsy of patients who died of COVID-19 and lung infections.
Although SARS-COVID-2 has a tendency to infect cells with ACE2, there are signs of hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 patients.
In particular, the appointment of inflammatory IL-6-discharge monocytes in the pathogen GM-CSF-discharged T-cells was found to be associated with the acute lung disease.
The autopsy also revealed the intrusion of white cells.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of guidelines for testing the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is a recognized method of testing.
The respiratory tract samples obtained by the throat females are generally tested; however, respiratory tract discharge or spitting samples can also be used for this.
Test results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but this requires two samples of blood done at intervals of two weeks, and the immediate value of its results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the species of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequencing, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that identify the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose current infections and can also tell if a person has had the infection before) were developed, but they were not widely used.
In China, the accuracy of the tests is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point of care test for use at the end of that month on March 21, 2020. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital have suggested methods for identifying infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of the disease.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass ambiguity with peripheral, asymmetric and background distribution was common in early infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, bizarre paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and concentricity may occur.
There is little information available about the physiognomy and microscopic injuries of COVID-19.
The following are some of the important facts about the pathogens found in the post-mortem:
Things that can be seen by the eyes: inflammation of the lungs, pain in the lungs, inflammation of the lungs and inflammation of the lungs
There are four main types of pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, overgrowth of the lung cells, unrelated large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammation including white cell intrusion, and the formation of versatile large cells
Acute pneumonia: Insufficiency of the lungs and uncontrolled discharge of the lungs
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome) and acute lack of oxygen are the main causes.
Healing Pneumonia: A collection of uncontrolled discharges in the lungs and interstitial fibrosis in the lungs
Blood: internal secretion of the arteries (deceased intravascular coagulation); leukorythroblastic reaction
The measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, avoiding touching of eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends holding a handkerchief in front of the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. If there is no handkerchief, cover the nostrils with the corner of the hand.
It is recommended to wash your hands after sneezing or sneezing.
The CDC has suggested that people without symptoms should wear face coverings while walking in public places to limit the spread of the infection. The aim of social distancing is to reduce contact with large crowds of infected people. That is why schools, offices have been closed, travel restrictions have been imposed and mass gatherings have been banned.
People are advised to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other.
While the vaccine is not expected to be available as early as 2021, a key part of the management of COVID-19 is now to contain the disease, which has been termed as 'flattening the curve'.
The CDC recommends people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear to be damaged, before eating and after touching the nose, as well as after coughing or sneezing.
Further, the CDC recommends that hand sanitizers with alcohol content of at least 60 percent alcohol be used only when soap and water are not available. In areas where there are no commercial products of hand sanitizer, the World Health Organization (WHO) has given two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the antibiotic activity is produced by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to inhibit the growth of microbes in alcohol; it is not an "active substance for hand sterilization."
Glycerin has been added as a preservative.
Patients are managed through supportive care, which includes giving oxygen, fluid treatment and supporting other important organs that have been affected.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspected to be carriers of the virus should wear a simple face mask.
The treatment of oxygen from outside is being used for the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being realised.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in mild symptoms at an early stage of infection.The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for care of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital.
The IBCC is a single open-source system that has been compiled by critically ill patients and lung specialists in the United States who have compiled recommendations for treatment from various agencies.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals recommend the use of paracetamol initially instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the process of creating a trap of physical fluids in the air, such as using a hose or hand ventilation in medical facilities.
The CDC recommends keeping such patients in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) along with general precautions, contact concerns and precautions for health workers who are taking care of COVID-19 patients. The guidelines for use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic have also been outlined by the CDC.
Recommendation of Preventive Equipment for Preparation: PPE Gaon, respirator or facemask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, preference should be given to respirators instead of facemasks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved the use of masks under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air, but, in other uses, cannot guarantee its effect on a particular biological medium.
When masks are not available, face coverings or homemade masks can also be used as a last resort as recommended by the CDC.
Most COVID-19 patients aren't serious enough to require medical ventilation or some other option, but some percent of them are.
The type of medical respiratory facility that patients are getting due to respiratory obstructions due to COVID-19 is being continuously studied for the people in the hospital. The process of inserting a hose into the body can be avoided by the nasal high flow duct or by the bilevel positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether or not one of these two is equally beneficial for patients with severe illness.
Some doctors prefer aggressive mechanical ventilation treatments if available, as this technique limits the spread of airborne pathogens in comparison to overflowing pipes. The incidence of the disease is very high in older people (especially in people over 60 years of age, who are over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries also do not have adequate hospital beds per capita. This may limit the capacity of the healthcare system when dealing with the question of hospitalization of critical COVID-19 patients if there is a sudden increase in the number of cases.
According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of the total cases were admitted to the ICU department, 2.3 per cent of the cases required external ventilation and 1.4 per cent of the deaths.
About 30% of the COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals in China had to be finally admitted to the ICU.
Due to the development of acute respiratory problems (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes complicated and it becomes more and more difficult to provide oxygen.
During the high supply of oxygen to the ventilators and high PEEP, there is a need to reduce the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by the ventilator.
High capacity PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing testing.
Remdesivir seems to be the most reassuring.
Although new drugs will take time until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs that have been tested have been approved for other uses or are undergoing further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers as recommended by the World Health Organization participate in trials to study the impact and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has provisionally approved the treatment of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine if they are effective and safe treatments for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app can show 'near contact' from the information monitored and it can give an idea of the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If possible, the app suggests self-isolation. Not only that, but it also informs local health authorities, big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, all of which are used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to monitor infected patients and those who have come in contact with them.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security departments to check the mobile phone data of people who are likely to be infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose isolation and protect those who could come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom handed over the aggregated data of phone locations to the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to be used to prevent and research the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed a technology to identify the faces of people who break the quarantine.
Italy's regional health commissioner Julio Galleria said he was receiving information on his mobile phone.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 partners.
Meanwhile, Estonia's President Carlsbad has called for a global response to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distressed due to isolation, travel restrictions, adverse effects of treatment or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress, and economic decline are the root causes that threaten people's mental health and well-being."
These diseases may have little or no symptoms at all, which are associated with other respiratory diseases such as colds and coughs.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while severe illness can take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on information from other similar viruses like SARS, MERS, it can be said that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 are at greater risk, but information about COVID-19 is not available.
COVID-19 can develop acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) in people who are severely affected, which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure, etc.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage, etc.
6% of the people admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 have been diagnosed with blood clots, increased prothrombin time, and 4% of these groups have kidney function disorders.
Nearly 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes.
In the same report, it is stated that the period between symptoms of the disease and death was ten days, out of which 5 days were to be admitted in the hospital.
However, the period between the hospitalization of the patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit and their death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the period between death from the onset of symptoms of the disease was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8%, while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
The histopathological test of the post-mortem lung sample shows both the cellular fibromyalgia in the lungs along with the diffuse alveolar damage.
There have been viral cytophatic changes in neurons.
The picture of the lungs is similar to that of Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, 11.8% showed a high level of troponin or heart failure.
According to the March Report of the US, 89% of those admitted to the hospital already had some complaints. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affect the deceased.
Regional differences change the estimate of mortality in this situation, while also due to systemic difficulties.
Reducing the number of mild cases can lead to higher mortality rates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of cases that have come into contact in the past can mean that the current mortality estimate has been reduced.
People who smoke are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers, and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
Officials at the Hong Kong hospital found that there was a 20% - 30% reduction in the lung capacity of some people who had recovered from the disease, and organ damage in the lung scan.
This is likely to lead to post-intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who have recovered from the disease.
Based on the transaction of other coronaviruses, it can be said that immunity is likely to appear, but there are cases in which the coronavirus test has been positive in the next few days after recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that in such cases, there may be a long-term infection rather than re-infection.
This virus is natural and its origin is believed to be an animal and its transmission is due to infection.
Its origins are unknown, but by December 2019, the infection had spread from human to human to human.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January in 'The Lancet' showed that December 1, 2019 was the earliest date for symptoms to appear.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed December 8, 2019 as the start date for the onset of symptoms.
Various measures are generally adopted to calculate the death of the deceased.
These numbers vary from region to region and from time to time and are affected by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, period from the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In the last year of 2019, WHO has provided an emergency ICD-10 code as U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections and a number of clinically or epidemiologically-shared COVID-19 deaths as shown by laboratory-confirmed deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of people diagnosed, who die from a disease, and the 'Infection Mortality Rate (IFR)', which displays the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed), who die from a disease.
These figures do not have a time limit and adopt a specific population of infected by means of the case version.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, 4600,80 (1.7%) people have died so far in a small village called Castiglione d'Adda.
In Gengelt, the disease spread due to the Carnival Festival and spread among young people, leading to a comparatively low mortality rate and perhaps not all COVID-19-infected deaths can be formally classified in this way.
Moreover, the German health system is not burdened enough.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, as reported by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The effect and mortality rates of this pandemic are different for both men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy found that men had a higher mortality rate.
Men in their fifties are most at risk, with the lowest death toll between men and women in their nineties.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of these gender differences is not known, but the cause may be genetic and behavioral.
This could be due to gender-based immunity gaps, low smoking prevalence in women, and co-morbid conditions such as low age hypertension in men as compared to women, all of which could be due to higher mortality rates in men.
57% of infected people in Europe were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had no information on the gender gap between people infected with COVID-19.
The findings found that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the official name for the disease was COVID-19.
WHO chief Tandros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means coronavirus, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of the disease came to light: December 31, 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a particular geographical location (such as, China), animal species, or group of people, which was in line with the international recommendation of naming, and was intended to avoid stigmatizing anyone. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named as the Sivir Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communication, the WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in addition.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were both commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases as interim names for this virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidance against using the site in the name of the disease and virus.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Some digital manufacturers are printing the health surveillance material as nail swabs and ventilator parts due to the capacity limitations in the standard unfilled swabs.
For example, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed in a hospital in Italy and the supplier was unable to complete it on time, a local startup company reverse-engineered and printed 100 valves at night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the disease's roots, magnitude, treatment and other factors led to the creation of conspiracy, misinformation and distorted information and spread rapidly online.
Humans have been able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence that there was a replica of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
The government is conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "solidity trial" to assess the treatment effect of four existing antiviral compounds that are most effective.
While there is no vaccine available at present, various agencies are actively preparing the candidates.
The previous study on SARS-CoV-2 is being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurotransmitters to penetrate human cells.
So far, three vaccines have been developed.
First, the goal of the researchers is to create a complete virus vaccine.
The purpose of the use of such a virus, whether it is inactivated or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the human body's immediate immune response.
Another strategy is the sub-unit vaccine, which aims to produce a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to a specific sub-unit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-Spike proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme neuron.
A third strategy is about a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, an innovative technology to produce vaccines).
All these three strategies require testing for safety and efficacy of any experimental vaccine. On 16th March, 2020, clinical trials of one vaccine along with four volunteers were started in Seattle.
This vaccine has a risk-free genetic code, replicated from viruses that cause the disease. Antibody-dependent enrichment has been suggested as a potential challenge to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active medical tests are being conducted.
Seven tests were evaluated from already approved treatments for malaria, including four researches on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese research involves multi-purpose antiviral drugs, according to a report submitted at the end of April that includes nine tests on stage III occurring on remdesivir in many countries.
As per the April 2020 report, a dynamic review of medical developments for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is in attendance. Several existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritanovir and Lopinavir/Ritanovir with interferon beta.
As per the March 2020 report, there is provisional evidence for the effect by remdesivir.
The patients treated with remdesivir showed a medical improvement.
Phase-III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a need for a collective review.
Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending one gram of his daily dose, noted that his double dose is very dangerous and could even lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese Seventh Edition Guide also includes interferon, ribavirine or umiphenovhear for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data show that the test requires high doses of ribavirin to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further testing following the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is an early-speech protein for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE-2 technique.
There are major difficulties in the studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin that prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and found no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be complicated in the next phases of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guide by China’s National Health Commission after a short study.
In Italy, non-random tests of Phase 2 are being conducted at the national level, with positive results in people with severe illness.
Combining serum ferritin with a blood test to identify the cytokine storm, it means resisting the development, which has been considered the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved Interleukin-6 nerve antagonist for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome for a different cause called CAR T cell treatment.
There is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Research is underway as a non-vaccinated method of inactivating the transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
This strategy was used for SARS, but did not yield any specific results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action, through which passive antibodies can be treated against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are under development, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which contains the blood-liquid protein of the recovered patients, and which contains antibodies that are specific to this virus, can be increased for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
