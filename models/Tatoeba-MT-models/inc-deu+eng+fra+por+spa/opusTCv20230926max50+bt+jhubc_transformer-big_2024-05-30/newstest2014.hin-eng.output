Black box in your car.
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to repair the demolished highway system, many are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car’s dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driver and transmits that information to authorities, has now become a controversial issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore the outdated system to finance major U.S. roads.
In general, boring work like highway planning has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and lively alliances.
Keeping details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive – and then using this information to prepare a tax bill – have met with Libertarian environmental groups to raise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is amazing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned by raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to proceed further, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can get into such a system over the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a really important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether or not we choose," says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the South California Government Association, who plans to start tracking every mile fixed by motorists in California by the year 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country’s highway trust fund has almost gone bankrupt, financed by paying taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
Now the car in a gallon of gas runs more miles than ever before.
There has been no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians refrain from raising even a penny in taxes.
“Gas tax is absolutely not sustainable,” says transport policy expert Lee Munich at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
"In the long run it will serve as the most rational option," he says.
This is called a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seems good to urban liberals, because it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars drive, which can help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are keen on this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (AA-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favor of paying per mile by driver.
"It's not just doing what's going into a blind well," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been backed by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had graced the Congress to move towards per-mile payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million trial project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to get to work or to the city every day, the House leadership ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
It has the most willing Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in that direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement the change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 volunteers a short time ago, drivers were too impatient to think that the government could monitor every step they take.
"Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation, says, ""There was a major concern about Big Brother and other similar things."
It’s not what people wanted.
As the test progressed, ACLU, Nevada, warned on its website: “It will be quite easy to convert these devices to full tracking devices.”
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology infrastructure, which has to be inevitably disseminated to keep a record of every person’s daily commute.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles the car is running every day, but not where and at what time.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The discovery of this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The firm was originally not in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, with drivers having to pay based on their mileage.
But the device that it is testing is good for highway planners as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modems at a certain time interval.
"If you don't track people's pace and their location, they'll be more inclined to adopt this method," said Rayon Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-interference ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options for drivers.
They can choose a GPS device with or without GPS.
Or again no one can choose not to take the device, but rather to pay the fixed fee based on the average miles to be determined by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience instead of less in the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meter fees, provide "payment according to your drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists will be able to use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, “Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it due to the benefits it will get from it.”
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payments per mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can easily tackle the problem of insolvency highway trust fund by increasing the gas tax.
An additional one-time or annual fee may also be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use a lot of gas to pay their fair share.
"What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work," said Randy Rentscheler, the Commission's legislative and public affairs director.
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
However, his friend has been taken into custody by the police on the charge of concealing the belongings of the deceased.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation in the court.
On August 26, the police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum.
His family members had accused his friends of killing him as his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, police said the deceased's phone and SIM were examined and found that her phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
During interrogation, the woman said that the phone was given to her by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhiel also lives in the Padshahi Garden and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail had gone to Jhelum to bathe with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid took off his clothes and kept all the belongings on the side, while Ruhil went to the other side to smoke a cigarette.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhiel searched for Zahid, but he could not find him.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his use.
He didn't tell anyone that he had drowned.
Police told the court that Zahid died due to drowning and the post-mortem was also confirmed.
However, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 to conceal the facts and the belongings of the deceased.

MRF honoured with JD Power Award for the 10th time in a row
Chandigarh: MRF, India's largest tyre manufacturer and one of the top 15 global tyre companies, has been awarded the JD Power Award for the tenth time in a row.
The award is widely regarded by peers in the automotive sector as the equivalent of Oscar and is the most recognized in the industry.
Very few companies have received this award continuously for so many years.
MRF has increased the range of performance radial tyres called MRF JLO for high-end vehicles.
Low-profile tyres of 40, 45 and 55 categories are now available for vehicles ranging from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar to many others. The 13 size range now includes more than 70 premium vehicles models of Indian roads.
The water purifier has been offered by the Dew Guard Company for clean drinking water at the Lord Valmiki temple in Naya Nangal.
Receiving the water purifier offered to the temple by company representatives JK Kaushik and Khushbu Kaushik, temple president Virendra Adiya said this work of social service is commendable as now devotees coming to the temple will be able to use clean drinking water.
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old woman in a highly secretive manner.
This was revealed by his family friend, Martel Polanco.
According to him, three-time Prime Minister Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francisco Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a teen activist at the Forza Italia party.
It is here that Francesca, whose relationship was said to be just a pretense of her relationship with Balruskoni.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl, Martel Polanco, has revealed that she too was invited to the secret wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
When Polanco was asked about what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place in a private chapel at the residence of the former prime minister.
Nothing else can be said.
However, he did not attend the wedding.
He sent his congratulatory message to the newlyweds.
The couple got married three weeks ago on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, a 28-year-old woman, 50 years younger than her, got engaged to Francesca Pascal.
Berlusconi had laid the groundwork for the loneliness behind his decision to avoid Kirkiri.
In the low-lying areas, the rain continued intermittently between the eyes of the sun.
With this, cold wave has started in the entire plaintiff.
The minimum temperature in Srinagar was recorded at 4.8 degrees Celsius, Gulmarg minus -0.2 degrees Celsius and Leh minus 1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coldest in the state.
Meanwhile, the Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed for traffic due to heavy rains and snowfall.
There was heavy snowfall on the Jojila pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activism of the western disturbance, the snowfall in the higher hills of the plaintiff and the rains in the lower areas started early in the morning, which continued till late in the evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People had to stay at home to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was also disrupted in many areas.
Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
Meanwhile, the cold wave intensified in Jammu and Kashmir following heavy rains in the morning.
Jammu recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the western disturbance has started to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Srinagar-based Meteorological Department director Sonam Lotes, the weather in the plains is likely to be dry from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who is lodged in jail on sexual harassment charges, was again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being offered as a children's blood drinker Dracula, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order restraining the media from reporting on Asaram, saying he has seen every word reported in the media and sees no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and others?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer had accused the media of spreading rumours about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they have other options.
Earlier, the court had refused to stay the media coverage of the case.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The group director of the mall deducted the TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions but did not pay it in the state exchequer.
In doing so, the TDS kept depositing the money with itself.
On October 17, an investigation team from Mumbai had taken action in collaboration with the Jaipur investigation team.
During the investigation, it was found that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had started the Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, a group of mall operators was raided and surveyed.
Angry over the action, the businessman has made it clear to the Income Tax department officials that he is not ready to pay the TDS amount to the Income Tax department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking action.
The officials, who are probing the case, have clarified that in case of non-payment, the account will be sealed and recovery action will be taken.
In view of Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
With this in mind, the sale of cheap and fake maize is increasing.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more glossy, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized Rs 70,000 mawa from Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5,000 from Quetta colony.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for low-fat maize from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information about the garbage dumped in the garbage from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The train is being diverted from Nagpur to Mangalore.
The department seized the mave, which was priced at Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not entitle anyone to the mavericks.
The department treated it as an unclaimed property and destroyed it.
The department raided Jeetendra Caterers in Quetta Colony and recovered around 5,000 tablespoons of liquor.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to brighten and last longer.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S S Deshmukh, Joint Commissioner, Department of Chemicals, said the search operation for chemical sweets and cheap and counterfeit maves would continue.
In the next few days, the department has been informed about the expedition.
These sweets can also be poisonous.
The department asked the sweet traders to make sweets from good milk, mave.
The department has appealed to the people to beware of fake sweets and maves.
He was received at the airport by 42 senior BJP leaders.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a visit to Bihar for a condolence visit organised by the BJP.
The condolence yatra is being organised by the BJP to mark the funeral procession of the families of those killed in the Patna blasts.
A total of seven blasts took place in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were killed and there was an atmosphere of panic in the state.
The militants did not succeed, but six people were killed in the blasts.
The BJP has declared them martyrs.
The leaders of the party had left their village on Thursday.
On November 5, all their ashes will be flown together in the Ganga in Patna.
A relaxing trip is part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday to meet their families.
During this visit, they will also provide a cheque of Rs 5 each to the kin of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial aid.
India will take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODIs washed out due to rain, India had to win the series in any case and its batsmen gave it a record victory with a blast, leading the team to a 2-2 victory in the series.
Team India have achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again it will be the responsibility of the batsmen to cross the line.
The Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the biggest target is also proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have a lot of hopes.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got such an opening pair that is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a great opening partnership and gave Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
Virat Kohli is considered as the future of the Indian cricket team by Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many cricket pundits have called him even better than Sachin.
Virat Kohli, who turns 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India have won 16.
Chasing the target, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but too much dependence on them can be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj failed miserably in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings 'lifeline' can work for him in Bangalore One Day.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performances.
They are also demanding that he be taken to the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen till number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voggs and James Faulkner have also batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch did not leave any impact in the opening.
The lack of Mitchell Johnson in the bowling could be a huge blow to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashes series.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said Pakistan was working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of "showing peace".
Quoting intelligence agencies reports, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan was pushing the heel peak to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more divided after the separatists failed to plan to aggravate the situation on a large scale by instigating people in Kashmir.
Referring to the separatists' visit to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheer ul Islam, LeT, Hizb chief Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be ignited in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba and Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolishing the privileges of the army in such a situation as deadly, the BJP leader said it was also anti-people to say such things until there was lasting peace in the state.
This has led to anti-national elements.
He stressed that the statements of the leaders, the army and the security forces should be curbed.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. watchdog
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence informant, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the parliament in German if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been given asylum, to talk about testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted by Mr Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "Although the results of my efforts are fairly positive, my government considers dissent as a party-changer, and provides no defences that attempt to criminalize political speech with accusations of hooliganism."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed international community support could persuade the U.S. government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department include theft of intelligence and government assets.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit online: “Mr. Snowden has been willing to talk to German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure after the NSA claimed that it had bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Operman, the MP who chairs the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without completely ruining relations with the United States and putting them in danger," then it should also be taken.
Mr. Strobe Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on Twitter feed.
He was on a trip to Russia with two German journalists.
According to the former NSA contractor lawyer, Snowden is not able to return to Russia if he leaves Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany he would be "safe" there which assurances would be needed, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that "he had to face a terrible and persistent campaign" and that he was forced to leave home.
He, however, said the world was "happy and overwhelmed by the widespread responses" to its work of political expression.
World citizens, as well as high officials, including the United States, have underestimated the revelation of an irresponsible system of widespread surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines Carry - On-Bagage Charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to carry luggage for passengers on board its aircraft - on-storage.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday revealed that passengers can keep the entire box.
New Carry - On Charge is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 if the passenger would wait to make the payment as long as they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be earned to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
The airline started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid fees are filling up as much as they can carry - on baggage that is stashed in the overhead compartment, which means this compartment often has less space.
There is a way to bring down the fees for passengers on board.
O'Malley said that this new charge is not really about raising money.
It has become increasingly difficult to find the place of that overhead bin for the most loyal customers about Frontier.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate can get a bag free.
O'Malley said the frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fees won't start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline prefers them.
They argue that it costs money to handle the baggage, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as an indication that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them don't even touch the carry-on bag fee though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched Carry-on Charge for the first time three years ago, and partner discounter Allegiant Air later.
The other airline is Hungary's Wizz Air, which tracks add-on fees, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen.
He said Spirit's carry-on charge brings in $50 million a year, which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official of Midwest Airlines, recently flew in Spirit and wondered if passengers had to face carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was seamless," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he climbed it lyckety-split."
The frontier is also following a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The frontier said that the traveler who will take soda, or juice, can keep the whole box, and will give it free coffee only for once.
It will still provide water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but seven months after the passengers complained they withdrew and followed up after no other main airline was there.
If Frontier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline then this move by Frontier to charge a charge on carry-on is their latest attempt to drive customers towards their own website.
The airline pays the online travel vendor such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
The frontier, however, has moved ahead in this area.
Many frequent flight miles in September began to deliver half of those customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 mile frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows single passengers to choose their seat in advance when they purchase directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenues fell by 9 percent and its flight capacity fell by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republicans are trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
NSA Charges “Internal Error” Instead of Hackers for Website Crashes
The mysterious national security agency said on Friday that our website had been shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiencies, not because of hackers as claimed by some people online.
“NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight, due to an internal error that occurred during a pre-determined update,” the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
The claim is not true that this obstruction, was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the website of the NSA was closed for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still not accessible.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network had "not been compromised at all."
The spokesperson said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the NSA's website by a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that so much traffic is sent to the target website until the site is closed due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly mystical NSA, which was once called "no agency", has become a subject of debate and bitter criticism among the common people over the past months due to the large number of incidents of foreign and domestic espionage programs - which were collectively disbanded by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and secret NSA files from the secret NSA.
Due to the growing controversy about the agency, there was speculation after the incident tonight that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
A beautiful expression similar to the plot of 'Another Dronacharya', which shows harmony between the Dwapar era and today 's circumstances.
It was shown in today's context in which chains a guru is bound to walk on the wrong path.
The function was inaugurated by Chief Guest Prabhudayal Valmiki, Cantonment Council vice-president Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The play depicted the similarity of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and the circumstances of present-day Professor Arvind.
Directed by Anil Sharma, the play featured Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Becharan, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vinod Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, among others.
Jitendra C. Raj, a youth painter, and Hemant Kumar, who designed the set.
On the occasion, various cultural and literary awards were given away to the winners.
Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, head of Urdu department of Charan Singh Vivi, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and activist Jitendra C Raj were also present on the occasion.
The function was presided over by Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi, among others.
Bombardier's profits decline as aircraft delivers, orders fall
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and less than that on contract issues as pressured by aircraft orders and deliveries.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on issues its brand new CSeries aircraft will release any flight test data or complete its ambitious program of the aircraft going into commercial service from next September.
About a month and a half ago after the first flight of the test plane, it has been flown just three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell below the forecast and the stock has sent for more than 8 percent sliding to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsey, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating for "area performance" from "mother" stocks are limited to the next one or two quarters up.
"Weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive the new order for Bombardier Cseries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, the market will be skeptical of the program.
The Bombardier hopes that the aircraft family can now cut it off at the lower end of the Boeing and Airbus dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
Potential buyers wait for the test results of the flight to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but as confirmed for the CSeries, the order is moderated to 177.
With 15 customers and operators of 403 complete orders and commitments are available.
CEO Pierre Boudoin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time the first jets were put into commercial use.
The officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was running as per schedule.
"The test plane was on land longer than expected," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that it was determined during the intersection of the land test and software update aircraft.
Each manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We have decided to make a first flight and do an update period and said what we have done.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts believe customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said it will evaluate the service (EIS) schedule in admission and provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reaffirms our view that the service will be pushed into Q1/15 at the entrance," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
The fixed income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped modestly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenues of 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the division, the world's largest train manufacturer, had a revenue growth of about 11 percent for $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backlogs of about $32.6 billion as of September 30, slightly above December 31.
Some large contracts in the margins of the transport division were also affected by the execution issues.
The new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter, the executives said.
The shares of Bombardier, which announced the inclusion of Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Pichett Board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 even in mid-afternoon trades on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest rival to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work in the morning with complete honesty and dedication.
You don't lie to anyone and you don't think of it as stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our minds change and we start walking against the rule by putting aside the ideal.
Researchers at Harvard University and David Eccles School of Business in Utah have given a number of interesting facts.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values without stress at work in the morning, but honesty decreases in the evening due to fatigue or excessive pressure.
The researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point was higher on the left or right side.
The participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
In this experiment, it was observed that those who were tested between 8 and 12 am did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
While conducting experiments on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in check.
This enabled the researchers to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morals.
The study was published in the journal Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the miscreants fled from the spot.
The injured have been admitted to a hospital in serious condition.
Sundar son of Sohanveer, a resident of Madhi village, recently retired from the power department as a minor engineer.

When Sundar resisted, the miscreants shot him in the abdomen, injuring him.
On receiving the information, the family members of the deceased rushed him to a hospital in Meerut.
No case was registered till the filing of the report.
Three days ago, Jasveer, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot dead by two bike-borne miscreants while returning home from the same bank.
The police have not been able to trace any other case.
SHO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents would be revealed soon.
When the hotel staff protested, they started beating up.
A drunk MP's son, RK Singh, along with his younger brother RK Singh, who had come to the beach to rescue the hotel owner, started a scuffle.
In the meantime, a lot of people came.
When he tried to catch the youth, he fired from the revolver.
The firing spread panic in the area.
The hotel staff caught hold of him and informed the police.
The hotel owner, Munna Singh, has lodged a complaint against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, who hails from Koirana in Bhadohi district.
The police arrested Anand and seized the revolver.
According to inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, runs a hotel called Rag Darbar on the National Highway.

The inspector said the hotel is located near Bhti village and adjacent to Bhadohi district.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer jailed for giving secret information to Mr. Big about police investigation
Basharat Ditta, 42, reported the infamous criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people could find out about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The top defence lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid people would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
After concluding the deal due to his cocaine addiction, the 42-year-old Brashath Ditta provided sensitive confidential information to the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash," and who was praised as "Top Brief" by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
The 32-year-old Scarborough was seen holding three bags of cocaine in his lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for a Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After discovering the particles of cocaine in Ditta's hair, his wallet, and his credit card, the investigation found that Ditta was a "regular user" of the drug category.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of Scarborough and two of his associates.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merced, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others, who were jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million during multiple raids, and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, used to provide information to criminals because she feared that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a state law firm in Blackburnd, was today facing failure in Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty in two cases of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted about having cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time for the lawyer began when police found out that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two spies chased the suspect and found him coming to Ditta's house and carrying more than 60 percent purity drug under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta over the phone after the drug was placed, who went out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that narcotics were kept there and there were nine conversations between them.
The court heard that Ditta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial after finding A-category drug clues on her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and that his discussions were a matter of "legitimate privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by removing his wallet, but they were seized, and his hair was sampled.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run offices from his workplace as well as from his home, and his clients used to call at his house for legal matters.
After being informed by the main persons arrested as to what the detectives knew about him, the court said in the hearing that Ditta used to call the key persons of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier submitted the case.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecution, said: "The criminal lawyer should know best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, engaging too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a normal drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal, no doubt, since he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits of lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting it.
He made a lot of intimacy with certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement to be negotiated with his freedom.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halsted said: "Mr. Ditta converted himself from a criminal lawyer to a criminal at the time when he began receiving drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction caused him to compromise too much and become too weak for the purposes of leading members of organized crime groups who used him to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standards of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape under the guise of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire investigated Mr. Ditta, who was also found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a death penalty client in the US, a dinner guest for Muhammad Ali and an inspiration for her work on inequality.
Kenya's press is outraged by the controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying that "it is a frightening place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there in the future to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary?"
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM, said: "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said the new media tribunal would "always be partisan, because it is part of the government" and said the ban on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to them to reject this bill and send it back to the MPs," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will give the government "strict control of the media", while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya were "serious shocks" and described the bill as brutal.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an Islamic gunman attacked the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media broadcast security camera footage of the squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them looting the mall purposefully, causing officials to be angry with the Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and a mediaperson for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after the media raised a ruckus.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and 1 million Kenyan shillings and the additional risk of "removal" or non-recognition of the official press will be different.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the violator if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single sentence is sufficient to shake the foundations of most FM stations."
It also said that these measures could have devastating effects on what is described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By shutting down the media, politicians know they can do their own will.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew describes Kenyan media as the main source of control and balance in public life, writing "Nobody will ever know."
"If left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and take us back to the era of hunting and accumulating," he wrote.
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the anger of the people.
In May, he voted in favour of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and reinstated about 532,000 shillings per month, a tax-free bodybuilder salary, considered one of the highest in the world.
World's richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's wife's birthday is on November 1, but as the clocks ticked on the night of October 30, the entire Jodhpur started echoing from Nita Ambani's birthday.
Earlier, the atmosphere of celebration was completely created by the performance of AR Rahman's team.
In this musical night, which started at 8 pm, Rahman performed his signature songs.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage to showcase her dance moves.
Nearly 32 charterers arrived in Jodhpur to attend Nita Ambani's birthday celebrations.
Due to reduced parking space at Jodhpur Airport, the charters were parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 Luxury cars, including BMW and JugR, have been ordered.
Sood said that the sanitation system, street lights in the city have completely failed.
No action is being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that Panchkula be completely removed from the house.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said the city has got new councillors and mayors after the municipal elections but they do not have the power to do the work.
As a result, the councillors of the city have become a dummy and officials are doing their own thing.
He said the municipal corporation has crores of rupees in it but all the money is being deposited in banks in the form of FDs and interest is being collected.
But no steps are being taken to put money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of duping ground is the most serious.
Residents living in Ghaggar cross-sectors have been forced to live in hell for the past several years due to the construction of a doping ground in Sector 23.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the doping ground in village Jhuriwala for the past several years, but people in the area of Barwala are already suffering from a serious fly problem.
He said the health services and education system in the villages had deteriorated.
No work has been started so far to provide facilities to the people in the rural areas.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is about to begin work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the MDD that ended in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” just ahead of the Sustainable Development Summit that began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to "rise above national interests."
“I am very happy that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for setting the Universal Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do everything possible to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to achieve our far-reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns escalate as powerful figures clash
With a statue of Mozambique founder President Samora, who was staring down at them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, CEO of an investment company.
Frightened about the future of her country, she changed her corporate dress from a "We demand security" printed t-shirt in Portuguese and joined a mob in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
Clashes between government forces and Ray Namo have been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after a peace deal.
Re Namo was initially a notorious rebel of the white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid movement backed by the South African government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown struggle, but recent developments have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy.The vast offshore gas reserves of the northwest and coal reserves discovered by some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Eni could bring in investments of more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Re Namo says the government launched the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Re Namo bastion,
Attacks on former insurgents and then escalating, government forces attacked Renmo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the leader of the group, Fernando Mhang, a spokesman for Ray Namo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing the soldiers of attacking them.
President Armando Zebuzhan has called for an end to concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhan told AFP, French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" "whatever his forces continue to try to prove that he can enforce his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mjang was quoted saying that the 1992 peace agreement was cancelled by Ray Namo but has since become a matter of concern.
He told the FT that that agreement is not being honored by the free limo
Our vision is to return to the negotiating table, but seriously," Mr. Mojang said.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease tensions of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men fighting together (Jibuzhan and Dhaka)," said Joseph Han, a lecturer at London Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt to win concessions from the government and a morbid movement to loot the economy.
Ray Namo's share in the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), hopes to improve its performance in elections.
Mr. Mazhang says Mr. Jibuzhanko, who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to give up the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mr. Mazhang said.
It is not clear what kind of capacity Ray Namo has, but it has made it a major hit-and-run visit to police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes are in Sofa La province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with host Beira ports that rely on exporting coal to miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week after it threatened to attack the Ray Namo line.
When asked whether Ray Namo would be able to replicate this threat, Mr. Majangavinit was almost certain.
"Things weren't going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community, Mr. Mojang said.
The government of instability has exacerbated the frustrations, says Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent floods of kidnappings.
"The people who are responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and think he must be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need sustainability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught "as models for a way of life writer",myths and legends.
Thor's stories could show "There is no match for all the subtle tricks in brute force," while Arturian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths also teach that "it would not be appropriate to be taught in the wild and in some cases even in obscene and schooling," said Cross Lee Holland, advocating a "careful selection" of age-appropriate tasks.
"I think it's amazing, in America, myths and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I've been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called the authors and teachers "more informative" and this is "a new turn" for children, with messages being "represented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon with Norwegian myths and penguins of British folklore, said: “You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer writing for a child and an adult writer writing for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything has to come to a simplified or a happy end, because it is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than revealed through a story than has been said.
It doesn't show the old base.
MUMBAI: Head Constable Om Prakash retired after serving 32 years in the police department in Ghumarvin.
On the occasion, police officers and employees of the police department were present.
Om Prakash is a resident of village Bhaparal in village Bani Bhaparal.
He served better during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue about the fact that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago comedian Frank Fey, who served as a master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling jokes directly to people sitting in the crowd the way they interacted.
Faye's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute called Caroline Hirsch, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners appeared in carolines, and became huge successes, up to a level where they became big enough to be played in the club,” says Hirsch.
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual musical and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which featured other artists including Bruce Springsteen, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike coming to small networks.
Nick Kroll, zealously from the Deep-Cable sitcom (FXX's Ronchi Fantasy-Football-themed "The League"), reached the leading position, and now has his own comedy Central Sketch Show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall the Shell with Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate (Anthony Gelsenick, satirical, ethnically focused W. Kamau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the most prominent attractions of the celebration will be an interview: David Steinberg’s talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted the show "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry’s works,” Steinberg said.
He was telling me that, when he was here, sometimes he would go to the street between two buildings and think in himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, with a report showing concern over more supplies offset where China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel in Europe until late morning in electronic trading on the US crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 5.8 percent for the month of October, down 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But an increase in the activity suggested by strong demand showed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came on Friday.
This shows that growth could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a low of 7.8 per cent in the previous quarter in a two-decade to third quarter.
Brent crude also a benchmark for international crude used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
The court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's break and sports policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked changes that required a judge's order for the New York Police Department's pause and play program and removed the judge from the case.
Judge Shira Shindellar, of the US Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & 2, said the judge's decision will depend on the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city had ruled in August that it violated the Constitution in the way people were stopped and made out of their programme of interrogation.
The city police department has appealed its findings and its remedial orders, including its decision to allocate a surveillance to help change its policy and associated training programs.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request travel on Tuesday.
The appellate court has said that because it entered into the requirement agreements for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and misrepresented the Code of Ethics for US judges by the public, he should be removed from the judge's case, the statements should be answered publicly to criticize the court.
The judge ruled that police officers had wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pamphlet and sports program.
It has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program to test body-wearing cameras in some campuses where most stops occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the Nagar is scheduled for some time after being March 14, 2014.
The cease and desist device has been criticised with civil rights advocates.
Pause and sports policy has been around for decades in some form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, 684330 to an all-time high in 2011 has been recorded under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg to prevents growth dramatically.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by all four men's minorities and became a class action case.
Supporters of the NYPD's pause and change in the sports program have said that inappropriate behavior will end up moulding a more credible and effective police force and may affect other police departments using the policy.
Opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but will solve a broader problem of a police force under the pressure of crime, wasting money and not shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.
The judge noted that the suspension and cessation for the sport was not constitutional, but had improved the implementation of NYPD stops.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were briefed on various subjects, including tent pitching, flag poll, etc.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are sharing the spirit of unity by joining the prayers of all religions.
The camp principal, Vipin Kumar, is providing his special assistance to the state education commissioner.
Colson uses phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Colson, a former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to verify a so-called secret information about his affair with Charles Clarke when he was home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Polby's voicemail and "keep a watch" on the male, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
“Prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of the NOTW, is not known to stand outside the house and keep an eye on the people, but he keeps articles in front of the people, to see how people react to it,” Addis said.
He said the NOTW used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one included the editors themselves.
He knew the other way around, and he knew the other way around.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
The rumor about Clark's romance affair was first introduced by AOTW's feature desk when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
From Mulcare in August 2006, the tape of voicemail was seized from Ms. Polby's phone at least three times.
The investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer, which were named "Project" to Ms. Polby and her sister.
The period during which she was being examined, an anonymous call was made to Ms. Polby's grandparents and information was sought about her.
During the visit, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup monitored the visit of Ms. Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him via a voicemail to him: “I’ve got a story that we’re planning to run tomorrow, which I’d definitely like to talk to Charles.”
Mr. Addis said Colson's involvement in the case is in parson with other important individuals, such as former home secretary David Blanchett.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr Blanche about his affair with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to sign a contract with other people for hacking phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and WeatherUp have accepted phone hacking.
Promotion of corporate fear by NSA disclosures about state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter stormed the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
German media asked BfV to hope to identify the presence of Lissing Antennas and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. national intelligence, stressed that the U.S. should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal trade secrets from foreign companies and allow U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or to downsize their bottom line."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has built a whistleblower, began revealing his secrets to U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer certain that the director has not followed his word.
The US National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo, expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing that came to mind was that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful individuals can be targeted, then certainly business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy of German companies, the U.S. has almost become a big risk now, such as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that the U.S. has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the EU's lack of internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its reliance on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
Hasso Plattner, the president of the German business software company SAP, said "It's not a way out."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he wouldn’t have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is discounted in Germany, from coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about US technological sophistication and espionage access have proven to be a shock to some companies that previously believed the biggest surveillance threat is China.
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business entity, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabay, SAP’s co-CEO, says: “We saw a new question that customers didn’t come up a year ago – is that – is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will remain physically within that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and data and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
It has always been so.
“It’s been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussions, nothing has changed,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels, and we do, because it is in the national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defence system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it's too late to record a message whether it's foolish to leave a business from home by taking a usb stick, or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car makers Audi, says it's a one-year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to risk on overseas tours.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown away.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it is the top of many companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access to personnel and financial resources," BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned of economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
In February, the U.S. national intelligence was named in a second tier of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence that was behind China with Russia and Israel, according to France's The Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, a former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: “Services know very well that even if they join non-terrorist fights, they spy on their allies.”
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels, and we do, because it is in the national interest to protect our businesses.
No one is stupid.
The parents of the Georgia teenager who was killed in the "unique accident" believe his son was murdered
A Georgian teenager whose body was found wrapped in a resting mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, G.A., was found trapped in a matte directly behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators at the Landes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in a "unique accident," but the 17-year-old's family denied it.
Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that he "absolutely believes his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in the way the sheriff told them to die.
"They believe that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and common sense," Krump said.
They feel that this conclusion, is an excuse for the safety of the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mueller said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murree said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will abide by the facts, they will take us wherever we are.
My goal is to bring out the truth.
“I am of the view that environmental reasons exist for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told the reporter that initial autopsy showed signs that Johnson died as a result of "situational respiratory impairment."
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death."
"There are a lot of questions that should be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore also said he would ask the FBI to do so if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the Lundz County Sheriff's office.
On Wednesday, the Judge of Southern Georgia ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some clues as to how he died.
CDC issues children's allergic guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in 20 children in the U.S. has food allergies.
The CDC found that there was an 18% increase in cases of food allergies in children between 1997 and 2007.
This guideline informs schools how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and how to handle any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to stock up on epinephrine to cope with potentially fatal acute atrophy (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the epipen brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to keep stock of overdose of epinephrine easily.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is piercing in my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling in my tongue.”
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their Children’s ‘Gender Undefined’
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for babies born with unspecified genitals.
Now newborn babies will not be orthodoxly assigned male or female.
According to the new law, parents are not required to declare gender for such children, the law allows them to declare gender ‘undefined’ or ‘unspecified’ on a child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who may be in a hurry to make gender-specific surgical decisions for newborns, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, "I'm neither a man, nor a woman."
I will continue to be a stained, wound made by doctors.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under investigation for disorders of sexual development, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed penis.
It may be that Wallis Simpson has been intersex.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify the gender when there may be no gender determination and observe the psychological and physical development of the child before undergoing surgery if such a condition occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-identity cases, said Germany’s new law “appears to be a good thing.”
Intersex children create moral confusion.
“Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but this is not the case with most children,” he said.
You can specify the gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a penis will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle as to why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described as distinct from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not related to gender, but to their biological composition, which is neither explicitly male nor female, but is either a joint form of either or both, and neither of them is clearly defined.
These characteristics may exhibit secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as the crimes of harassment, violence and favouritism.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Welby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.
According to the interior ministry, the German passport will have a third specification in the form of an X for intersex persons in addition to the M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender-related issues are still controversial in neighbouring France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, saying, “While the world is going through a phase where gender itself is the choice, but not sexual activity, we are taking the two other pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would love to see babies being gender-specified at birth.
On the website, he said, “Raising without additional limitations is very stressful, especially if you don’t know what your child’s gender is.”
Children need stability and security.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (bisexual), named after the beautiful Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered penis as slate that could be erased and then written.
But now that so many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that gender-identity is a complicated task, and can sometimes be mistaken by physicians who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
Drescher says "in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a "psychological emergency."
When these babies were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered penis erectile dysfunction.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether he or she should be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had been accidentally sexed during the circusestion, to completely bond the child and remove his testicles and raise him like a girl.
"Money presented that case as a successful case of stagnation, but that didn't happen," Drescher said.
At the age of 15, the child turned himself into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, individuals undergoing these penis surgery began to come to the fore “not happy with the result”.
A similar case was with Montana's 36-year-old author Jim Bruce, who was born with an X-Y male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Physicians did not clearly understand that his penis was small, or that his clitoris was large, but they were sure that he could never live a “satisfying life” as a man.
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised like a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, he was about to have a vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and feeling something wrong, she demanded medical records.
It showed him the terrible truth.
I was taken captive at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he turned back to the man, he took testosterone supplements and removed his breasts.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people to normalize their perceptions about intersex individuals in an organization called Interface Project.
But, Anne Tamer-Mattis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chippies and stigma."
“A lot of activists feel that Germany’s law will drive parents to make quick decisions and specify the child as “undefined,” she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying the male or female gender is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be identified in third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender,” he said.
The law in Germany deals with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Dr Erlin Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who supports hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany’s law would “power both parents and children.”
Baratzi's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since she had a defect in the androgen receptor, female features developed in Katy.
There is a vagina in her body but there is no uterus or ovaries.
Katy, now 29, is married and is a resident at the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“This law allows parents not to make any hasty decisions on their own,” Baratz said.
It gives them proper understanding and time by some test before writing, ‘man’ or ‘woman’.
In this way, you live well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and have fun with it.
We don’t need to have surgery in a hurry that can’t be reversed.
“It brings children into the decision-making process and frees them from anxiety that motivates parents because they don’t believe they are doing well.”
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he or she is more comfortable with -- and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was organised by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Ramnagar, under the chairmanship of Ramnagar sub-judge Sandeep Kaur.
The students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for the economically backward.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj and Sarpanch were present on the occasion.
A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Report: Considering the Biden Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton's replacement for the vice president's ticket for 2012.
The most notable blast in the revelation is the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome by Mark Halperin and John Helmman, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "comprehensive group-session and polling in late 2011" to find out whether dumping can help Biden in the hopes of Obama's re-election fall.
According to The Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book details the efforts of the chief executives in the campaign and the former White House chief of staff for the name of the White House, to find out what effect the former state secretary Clinton's shift from vice president to vice president has on the polls.
The potential switch was a very secure secret within the Chicago campaign’s infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlord and David Palauffey – knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal synergy before finally making a decision when his information was telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said looking at the whole scene, and one of them, it was," Dale told the newspaper.
Do you remember, when the presidency was in jeopardy, we were in a situation like this, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dale described the research as "precautionary," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments in finding out how much the claim would pay dividends when the poll was conducted.
"The campaigns don't spend on voting and focused groups like money unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on the AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for a change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss was aware of a possible reshuffle.
While Dale said he "doesn't think the president was aware of a possible change", the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew it.
"Double Down" definitive: Will not answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk? Martin added.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the Biden dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Glow-in-the-dark likes ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the marine animals to develop the best breakfast.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical gloss to re-polish proteins.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of protein by reacting with the tongue and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream is ignited by the heat of the mouth, that is, the more you lick, the more it will ignite.
Charlie, founder of the Lick Me in Delicias ice cream company, said: “It’s an incredible thing but early-day production will get about 2 grams of stuff from <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The proteins we use in ice cream will react with a neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been experimenting for the past few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween because it gives a wonderful glowing effect.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've made because the glow of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, the taste of iska is very good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its aromatic unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next project is going to be even more ambitious.
He said: “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It's naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make refraction over ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the usefulness of fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire Rani Bagh market was flooded with customers.
People had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy pots.
It was located in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
Similar sightings were also seen at shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar and Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver ornaments and coins.
Due to this, other markets, including the outer ring road, were also closed.
However, those who left the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.
Today, I'm more than a fan.
I didn't even sign in to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and maybe not even this year.
But the data suggests that there is a black sheep when Halloween arrives.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually spending $158 million this time celebrating Halloween. $6.9 billion will be spent on candy and costumes and decorations.
One of the things that I've always seen is every... Halloween trends.
According to the NRF, out of $6.9 billion total cost, the cost of the costume is estimated at $1.2 billion.
This year, the whole world is angry at the sexist inanimate objects.
Women don't have to be obese, because they're sexist, like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
I hope a lot of zombies for the men, and thanks to the dead, will make our Instagram feeds for the space men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes will be Zombies, Batman, Thieves and Thieves.
I don't think there's anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we wore a dog and we were not alone.
According to the NRF, the American people will literally spend $330 million for pet costumes.
That's why there are so many dog breeds.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Heresy Bars, Lollipops, Milk Dads, Twislers and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it is good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are taking part in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we, and what's funny is that we're going to buy a <0xC2><0xA3>90 million chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we will not use candycorn during Halloween, but it will also sell around 35 million pounds.
That's the personal knot of Mecca about 9 billion.
It's a mystery. To solve yet
There's nothing more magical than the Halloween spirited homes.
They have the best names, "The Terror Behind the Wall" (which, in fact, is a prison), "Chik-o-Chik" and "House of Shock."
In fact, according to the American authority, there are 1200 officially approved ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenues. And the terrible good photos that your friend puts on Facebook and the guy who likes you and comments nice face.
Lastly, let's talk about the kebab.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not staying with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins.
The Jack-o-Murzanewala lanterns on its front porch probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you’re looking for additional debt, try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin, phone Tim and Susan Matsudas in Napa, Calif., and above.
"""It was decided to issue a postage stamp containing Sachin's photograph during the pre-match presentation,"" the MCA said in a statement."
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
Apart from this, a special coin will be used for the toss which will be handled by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page brochure containing articles related to Tendulkar and statements of people from business, sports and journalistic circles about him.
The association said the limited number of brochures and coins will be distributed to members of the MCA and BCCI.
He said that 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 hats will be distributed every day, which will have pictures of Sachin.

The dream of the firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area has not come true.
The firecrackers have been trapped in the condominium after the high court order.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary firecracker market built in Ranjit Avenue nor have they been issued licences for doing business in the transport area.
The Punjab and Haryana High Court-appointed commission declared the Ranjit Avenue temporary firecracker market unsafe during its visit.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs 10 lakh for lack of proper management there.
The high court, in its order, has slammed the Amritsar administration officials, saying what kind of work has been done by an administration that has not been able to solve even a single problem of firecrackers for nine years.
They could not find a suitable place in the city.
Following this, the firecrackers were asked to issue licences for trading in the market located at Naveengarh.
The firecrackers were happy after the order, but on their happiness, the police diverted the water on Friday.
The police team of the Asalha licensed branch reached the firecracker market and sold the form by putting counters there.
It was impossible to complete the conditions which were then communicated to them in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Asalha license branch in-charge Anoop Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the spot.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by firecracker traders.
Therefore, licences were not issued to firecracker traders.
Diwali is just one day away.
As a result, firecrackers are in distress.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecrackers Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said they would file a claim against the district administration if they lost crores of rupees.
Angry firecrackers marched from Naveengarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
After this, trading at the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue was also stopped.
A fire brigade was called in to rescue a lost pappy at the mouth of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after hitting a small road.
He was seen by a dog walker trapped in the mine three days later.
Firefighters lowered the front part of the cliff from the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After Papi somehow got stuck at the mouth of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground, the call of firefighters gave him a lucky life.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away on Sunday afternoon after a road collision and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Danholm, were in the Flappit mine in Paschimchi Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and he has thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away after a small accident, he searched for his lost dog like crazy, and an appeal was posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, at a height of 50 feet above ground, on the mountain.
A technical rescue team from Kleckheaton Fire Station arrived at the scene and took Ruby down by rope to rescue him and used a belly tube to bring him down from the rock.
Expert technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
She did not do a single act during the rescue, she remained a stone.
But now he is fine.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
Seeing a dog is unbelievable.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby survived in a fortunate manner."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
At first, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It's amazing to have him back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell down, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What he has done is indeed very courageous.
We admired him and he was the best of us all.
Mr. Alderson from Keegli also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firefighters did a fantastic job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry didn't hit her when she was 18
During an interview with Australian radio show this week, Pon Starr said he had sung backing vocals for Jaeger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and when I was 18, he hit me.
"This thing gets old, and he treats me well," he said.
The 70-year-old Jaeger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perhaps Parry, speaking about them in another person's misunderstanding"
Parry was one of the singers who appeared as guests on Rolling Stone's Tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
George Kerevan: Europe's disintegration gives Scots a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone throughout Europe as a condition for membership of the EU.
Passport controls on Barwick and indicate stories about the boundary of barbed wire on Hadrian's walls.
True, the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
Neither did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as per their requirement.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen area, Brussels will be an affordable discount for permanent non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has frozen. At first I heard the baseless news of “freedom means passport control” about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should independent Scotland expect to bid for Europe anyway?
Why is London's yoke being bought and sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the European crisis, the project is officially dead.
Throughout the EU, dedicated parties are gaining strength to oppose the EU or to close the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptil Alternative for Germany party - founded this year itself - suddenly came and garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thus effectively knocking out the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be radically transformative.
In addition to the stringent rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the odds imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency are causing many to think that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro did not play a very large role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized its members' currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a position with an inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public spending — which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity morbidity beyond the current budget and currency problems.
In order to provide discounts to French and German energy firms on consumer spending - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a paralysing cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even freezing all the wages in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be saved from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a way to keep Germany under control, and to provide Paris with billing equivalent to the Vaughan in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to slump.
Result: Marine Lee Penn's right-wing, the anti-EU National Front, has won by pushing the ruling socialist to third place in the recent by-elections.
At this time the front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it's a timely warning for British labor that they can't walk away assuming that disintegration for the left, will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his newly found fame in the midst of the French whites, the working class?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU, anti-money laundering faction in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then this type of faction can influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-monopoly sentiment in Europe will put an end to the euro.
The euro will not be completely eliminated, but it will return to retail in some form like "Europe of (sovereign) nations" supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its sustaining economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I hope that the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing its closeness with the U.S.
However, Vanshigton’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What's next for Scotland?
We can choose to remain the territory of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to leave at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in loose European order, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-EU countries to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic independence while walking the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful anti-economy political campaign in Europe, winning a surprising majority in 2011 based on the (and implemented) cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling and then the Tory-Lib Dam coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the rules of frugality imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: Growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls attain puberty at a younger age than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of puberty at a young age
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys.
Pat Ethridge, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist on children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
This week at the American Academy of Pediatrics' annual conference in Orlando, Florida, Pediatric Endocrinologist Dr Paul Kaplanwitz made it clear that these initial physiological changes are common among American girls, reflecting these new trends.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — that in general it doesn’t reflect rapid progress toward full puberty,” says Caplovitz.
Direct signs of growth such as breast sprouts, genital and eye hair and body odor are seen in girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first menstrual period).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in the year 1970.
“When the breasts begin to develop, the first rheumatism takes at least two to three years,” explains Caplovitz, who is also the author of “The Guide to Premature Puberty in Girls: The Necessary to Deal with This Common Problem.”
The most accurate test of youth development is the time.
There is debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when there is growth with breast development before the age of 8 years, the two call it "child-adult."
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop – which can be closely monitored by a hair doctor.
In the event of a more rapid progression, an endocrinologist may be required to examine the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments for delaying premature menstruation and other consequences: premature ageing of the bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and declining stature as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, “Preventing youth can exacerbate behavioral issues, and girls may feel different from their peers.”
The second big problem can be understood: parents simply don’t want their younger daughter to have menstrual periods.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene,” said Caplovitz.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, recalls, “It was a shock.”
Although there were signs of this and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She returned to her school scared and troubled that she had started menstruation first among her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexually transmitted messages in the media can be charged.
Boys - just like girls - are gaining pre-mature puberty.
Caplovitz sets the rule that the main reason for this is an outbreak of obesity.
She assisted in conducting the study on girls aged 6 to 9 in the year 2001, which combines body fat with the time of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get puberty before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty seems to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to weather and jeans.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of full puberty is not as clear as that of girls.
Other physicians who attended the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginnings of puberty,” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gouryb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician to get an opinion on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean negotiating ahead of the expected time," advised Caplovitz.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls with premature development need to be assured that even if this is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
On Thursday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 3.1 degrees Celsius.
The cold and rainy weather on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Thursday, people wore sweaters and marched towards the markets and their destinations.
After the first rains of the winter, people have also taken out their quilts.
In the morning, people also enjoyed the sunshine.
As the weather changes, there will be a lot of relief from the disease, but after that, the sun continued to shine due to cloudy weather.
The children also wore their school uniforms.
According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
It received 7.8 mm of rain.
According to the meteorological department, the sky will remain cloudy in the coming days.
Large orders of jet manufacturers at stake from dispute for seat width.
Settling the rhythm for the fight for this month's Dubai Aerospace, there has been an uproar among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-distance flights.
The controversy centers on the width of the economy class seat in long-haul flights, not always as given by airlines but whose assigned location efficiency has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company to be key.
Airbus expects an industry standard to be at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by airlines, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute between the aircraft makers comes after a large version of the twin-engine long-range aircraft was forced to be sold out of the order that was likely recorded after the 17-21 incident.
How has the rear section of the aircraft been designed - especially whether the seating is 9 or 10 equal to the design of the mini jumbo jets, taking into account the claim of greater capacity?
Boeing says it has created a "777 X" that will house 406 people in a 17-inch wide and 10 in a row economic department.
According to Airbus, it will take 350 people to a nine-equivalent seat left 18-inch.
Aircraft giants often strike on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai, such an appeal to the public is going ahead.
Recently it has been seen that there has been a beginning of the Vigilance War, showing this to Finnsero that all three together in a restaurant together, would you accept it?
Airbus sales chief John Leigh said "Boeing is also offering long-distance flights in narrows from regional turbos."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way the aircraft is sitting has not changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 Jumbo was defined as a modern long-term trip, and at the end of the century the average 40-49-year-old American male gained 10 percent of his weight.
According to U.S. health statistics, the waist of the average American male in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the average perimeter of the new name "Jet Set" was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional inch of seat width to improve sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing has disputed Airbus seat measurement data, saying it is not up to the makers to decide how airlines strike a balance between fares and facilities.
It also says that research shows that the width of a seat over depends on the experience of the cabin.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Kraver said: “It really helps airlines to be resilient and to believe in the things they need to do to succeed.”
"They don't want to tell us what they're worth."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's about elbow room, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
Trade is estimated to be worth at least $700 billion behind the controversy, with aircraft order competition enough in the coming decades to tip the scales of American and European exports.
Reuters reported that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is really a fight between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed to have a 20 per cent performance per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Er in their new twin-engine design.
Boeing's performance claims are based on a 10-inch 777 X One compared to the original 9-inch 777 design.
10 equals with gains in unit cost is now used to compare.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility, says "Boeing's doing it to occupy more seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products."
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin suggests for the existing 777 S that many passengers favor the denser layout, which can go along with cheap fares as well.
"The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for travelers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of a 777," said the cabin interior expert, Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for airlines.
Jet sellers around the world should also take careful measures to check on this layouts competition.
While more relaxed, all builders are also offering high-density layouts for low-cost airlines of jets and regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10-equivalent A350 but says it is not yet sold.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on broader cabin seats on some of its jets to require more cabin facilities.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard, without the support of another manufacturer, but it can distract from the wave of 777 X sales.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine may end the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is needed before trials on humans can begin, which may take years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weille Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs were positive.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine, much more powerful than these existing methods,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus designed to deliver genetic information for the purpose of producing anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent the smoker from asking for nicotine inside the brain by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the vaccinated rats, who were later given nicotine, continued to perform their normal activities.
But the rat who was not given the vaccine "looked good", the researchers say, was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be dosed at regular intervals to keep the antibodies level, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, as the liver will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the temptation to try cigarettes, to protect them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again they won't get any enjoyment from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists called the result interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the post-mortem, the exact cause of the death of the tiger could not be ascertained.
The forest department is responding to Golmol saying that the death of the tiger is prima facie natural.
On Thursday night, forest officials of Ramnagar forest division found the body of a tiger near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain.
All the organs of the body of the tiger were safe and there were no wounds or injury marks etc. on him.
On Friday, the body of the deceased was sent for post-mortem examination in the presence of Forest Conservator Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kahkasha Naseem, SDO GS Karki and CTR Veterinary Doctor Bharat Rathore.
According to sources, the body of the tiger is said to be damaged during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of the death could not be ascertained.
Officials of the department continued to give a befitting reply to the tiger's death.
However, the internal organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for a topological examination to confirm the poison.
The death of the tiger can be termed as natural, said forest conservation officer Vivek Pandey.
No signs of poisoning were found from the body.
However, a probe has been launched into the matter and the surrounding area has been sent to Bira for confirmation of the poison.
Tripods deny us being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by the State Corruption Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to refute the policy on maritime leases at the request of his political guru Eddie O'Brien, a former New South Wales patron of Eddie O'Brien, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the investigation into whether Mr. Obaid violated the circulars of the Lobbying Lease Policy from several State Ministers where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid were renewed without tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Lynn Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff after Thursday's evidence that Mr. Tripodi knew Mr. Obaid's hidden motives for the allegation, is now under investigation.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressed for the introduction of public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against this and they wanted more time.
Circular enterprises for leases in 2009, making Obide $25 million a year, were renewed without lease tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the public tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr.Obaid, Mr.Tripodi had requested for a change in the Government Leasing Policy
A transcript in a phone call to the ICAC in August and September 2007, Mr.Obid and Mr.Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr.Obid after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the matter,?"
"No," said Mr. Tripoli.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. O'Brien.
Officials say that Israeli fighter jets fired in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed Fox News.
The official did not say what the motive was, but there was at least one motive.
The Associated Press reports that the target Russian missiles were SA-125.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas can pass the "Authenticity" test.
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to extend a drastic process.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent the use of 457 to fill unqualified positions in Australia or to be delivered to family and friends in a disguised manner.
A government discussion paper was released today, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McCain said today that it could anger Australia's neighboring countries.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreigners are arriving at the end of the queue" and the "strong rhetoric about Australians getting jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labour market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been given protection - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area had seen the resonance of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about people smuggling, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "Authenticity" standard is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined as to whether "the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is the relative or personal partner of the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or of the person sponsoring the visa."
Businessmen may need to keep a count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack this week after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The man's nine-year-old son had come with him to Australia on a trip, and after his father's death on Wednesday, one of his adult cousins, who was on the same ship, has been tied up.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kremer said the project "would make Britain one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very "enthusiastic" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include the new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of the second stage, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transportation, directed HS2 Ltd to consider the possibility of further improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of three hours or less the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Baroness Kramer: “Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.”
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be much greater.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland’s “clear” return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “High-speed rail is likely to have huge economic benefits for Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all, and explore options to meet the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the British government ministers next year and taking a joint decision on further action.
Aircraft electric appliances rules will remain in effect in Australia
In line with the move to ease equipment regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left U.S. aviation service companies with options open to changing their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their equipment during important stages of flight, provided they are in "aviation" mode.
Passengers can do this on many flights right now, but many people do not like to fly and are unable to access their e-books, etc. while landing.
Australian aviation service companies are considering the decision, according to which U.S. airlines will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still effective at critical stages of flight in Australia.
"Currently, the CASA does not have any specific regulation regulating the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, "the issue falls under the regulations, according to which the airline operations companies have to ensure that the safety system is always fully maintained, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members."
Virgin, who is already in talks with the CASA about extending the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but asked to take further action on the regulator's directive.
"We will welcome the review by the CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes," the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would follow the current rules.
"According to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during flight and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change it," it said.
FAA decisions apply to American Allerlins.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travellers and we will definitely consider the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each US airline service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aviation service companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio personalization from mobile devices, as well as make amendments in their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and briefings to passengers.
"After verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by airlines, it will allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing the plane.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely kept under the seat or in the upper compartments while flying and landing the aircraft.
Ponbrokers' silver in Singapore due to difficulty felt by the middle class
Janani Amirthalinga, who works at a Pony Shop at Bendemir Shopping Center in Singapore, is taking cash with her gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it," said Mrs. Ameerthalinga.
She says, though she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia — where domestic debt is rising — ValueMax became the third Ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Mortgage is not the only way to get cash – in the case of Ms. Amirathlinga’s 1,300 Singapore dollars – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
In Singapore, Ponbroker generally charges interest at 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people are turning to Ponshops in the region due to the increasing cost of living by families and the increasing domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle-income families are turning to Ponshop to meet their needs due to the slowdown of their economy.
This week, the ratings agency, Standards and Poor's, described rising domestic gains, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Asia has the highest domestic debt in terms of GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the tech recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a steady export slowdown and a decrease in consumer demand.
"The decisive point is that with rising prices, those coming from the middle to the lower class [of the income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way," said Song Seng Wun, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to mortgage personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family's jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the mortgaged items in the city-state's 200 pound outlets are gold.
People are saying, "The gold is looking good, let's mortgage the grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest Ponshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the mortgage business that outlet operators Valuemax in Bendimir and 15 others like it in Singapore, not only in their neighborhood, are planning to expand to Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yahya Lee Ching, executive director of Valuemax.
The company will finance it by using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received in the listing this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While there have been criticisms of some discount lenders due to higher interest rates, Ms Yah says that mortgages not only get a cheaper rate compared to other lenders, but it also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage items that they already have, and capitalizing on personal assets does not increase domestic debt," she says.
The social acceptance of Ponbroking is increasing for obtaining short-term and secure financial assistance.
It is not that Ponbrokers are only used by financially weak people.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax outlet, they mortgage gold bars or Rolex watches to get up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all sections of society.
“These include wealthy individuals who need short term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements,” says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani says wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organised a large party on the occasion.
Several big Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party. In the late evening of October 31, several big stars were seen catching a flight to Jodhpur at the Mumbai airport.
Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and their wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapur, Rajkumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, among others.
You can imagine how big it will be when such a big name joins the party.
$325 million rescue package for Taji's health
The Union government has stressed that there are also stringent conditions associated with the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's sickening health system, which will ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic diseases, and limitations of the system.
The funding decision to be made over the course of four years was made after consultation with the government with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges faced by the state.
The $325 million package also includes an optional surgery plan of $31 million.
More than 2,600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous accumulated cases.
This includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lawnsstation, better care after leaving the hospital, training of medical specialists, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health records system in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the best practices I’ve been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania’s health system,” Ms. Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report each month on where additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be constituted to ensure that service is rendered by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean too much, “unless real reforms are made to take Tasmania’s public health system to a more sustainable level.”
Yet, he praised the government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.”
“I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful in the direction of segregating the state-run public health system from the crisis-affected list,” said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will largely undo the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today’s announcement is “the band-aid solution.”
He told ABC TV, "We are here for the reason that the Labour State Government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You can’t take the state government’s nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth’s 300 million dollars as a day of good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should give a guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation of Dennis Diderot's novel by Giloom Nicklaus details the best production design and time period, but it has exceeded what it should have been.
The novel, dated to the 1760s in France, tells the tragic story of the young nobleman named Suzanne, whom his family members send to the Convent.
When she rebels, she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluntarily oppressed Mother Superior, and becomes an object of erotic attraction to the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation – and that’s the problem.
Due to the strong gravity of narration, there is also the risk of becoming a boring film for the audience.
CSA Vice-Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to levy entry fee in the garden due to the dirt in the garden.
At the same time, an ultimatum of 15 days has been given to repair the deteriorating condition of the departments.
The Vice-Chancellor, along with the garden department, conducted a surprise inspection of seed and field and director research at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including directors, absent from his seat.
After being reprimanded, he warned of pay cuts if he was found absent the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 will be required for a month-long walk.
People will be able to visit the garden at a fee of Rs 1 per day.
Work will be done from the system: Files coming in front of the Vice-Chancellor related to various functions will be accessed under one system.
Every employee will not have the right to take his file and enter the Vice-Chancellor’s office.
The officers concerned will reach out to their final vice-chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed critical equipment to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas warfare materials, while a fierce conflict erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to where toxic agents are believed to be stationed.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian movement said nearly 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the Syrian civil war that began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) comes a day before the last date of November 1
The Hague-based organization had designated Damascus to destroy or "improve" all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and machinery used to fill war materials.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in this ambitious development that aims to destroy all of Damascus’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came at a time when conflict escalated in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The group, which details the death toll through the network of the movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
The government said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 are fighters in favour of the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
About 20 million people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's army fought the insurgents in Safira for weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties from both sides, but did not explicitly say anything.
It reflects the threat faced by inspectors of war, chemical weapons, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war, in a very short time frame.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team is "still satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen - all of Syria's declared significant production and mixing/filling equipment destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors had said they had visited 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus and completed the first phase of the verification.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit the two centres due to security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centres have been "abandoned and ... chemical weapons products kept there were delivered to other declared centres, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira is one of the two centres where the inspectors of OPCW were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the persistence and courage shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,"" said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Group in a statement issued by the OPCW."
The civil war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly between Assad's government and its security forces, including members of the Shiite sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
Among other developments, the head of the Observatory Rami Abdurrahman said a powerful explosion at the Air Defense Center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia occurred on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered fake registry, forged seals, laptops and photocopies of forged registry from the possession of the accused.
The police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjeet Singh Gill said the accused have been identified as Rajeev Aggarwal alias Binttu of Chandra Nagar, Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gagi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with Balbir Singh, clerk and record keeper of the office of the registrar, used to take out the papers from the records of the vacant and old lands and then procure new stamp papers and prepare a fake registry on them.
And then, after a while, the book was revealed to the world.
Thereafter, the accused used to sell the land on fake papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land continued to be hit by the police and administration.
The accused, who were preparing the fake registry, were keeping a close watch on the lands of NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easier to prepare and sell the fake registry of those lands.
During interrogation, the accused said they have prepared around 150 fake registries so far.
According to the police, there have been previous cases of cheating and theft registered against Rajeev.
Convicted of plotting bomb blast in Bali
In 2002, the families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb blasts expressed their displeasure over the punishment given to the perpetrator of the bomb blast, saying Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who ran for nearly 10 years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted individuals, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blasts.
He can be released after 15 years on parole.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of church bombings in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could also demand the death penalty for this man, notorious as a "devastating person" as the master who made the bomb.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of the Perth-based woman, June Cortine, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other dreaded terrorists.
"She should be put before the firing team," Ms. Cortin told AAP.
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the club was demolished after a bomb exploded in a van parked outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the pedigree bar at the time of the explosion exactly 20 seconds before the bagpack filled with explosives by the suicide bombers.
They went into a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and "death" three times while on life-saving equipment.
Mr Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment as three other members of the Jemmah Islamia terrorist group - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding countless people, 20 years of imprisonment is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of one of the Bali bomb blasts.
He survived being captured for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"She did not surrender," says Ms. Cortin.
Even today, the pain of hurting so many people is not really there.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears flowing this year," Ms. Cortin said.
Patek could still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use the gadgets in the aircraft (but cannot make calls from cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from entering the gate to reading, working, playing games, watching movies, listening to music - but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - this is in line with the highly-predicted new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Huarta said how quickly these changes are implemented will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meets the new guidelines, and how they are updating the training manuals of their crew members and the rules for collection of devices to show the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Based on the plan's position, we can very quickly approve the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane's door is closed.
They are expected to reach an altitude of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and not turn on them until allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane lands, and do not turn it on until the plane is fully landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruptions may allow their passengers to use the device during flight, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can access WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work closely with airline companies to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Gliding said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are fed up of feeling like "hall monitors."
However, surfing, e-mailing, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet will still be banned.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversations with friends, an online scrabble-like game that is famously associated with the fact that when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while parked at the doorway in 2011, American Airlines dropped him off when he refused to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. will still have to be stored as their jumping will cause other person to get hurt in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board's Mark Rosenkan, a CBS News national transport safety expert, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not just because they can potentially disrupt navigation-related devices, but also because they can disrupt cell phone towers when they are in the air," Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee, set up by the FAA to examine the issue, recommended last month that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA to reduce restrictions on their use has been increasing.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, have said there is no legitimate security reason for the prohibition.
These restrictions are becoming more and more difficult to enforce because the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when reports of disruption to navigation and communication devices were received by passengers carrying FM radio and high-tech gadgets at the time.
The new airline companies are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
For many years, airlines have been proposing to passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes.
The aircraft modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to disruption.
Huarta said most airline companies should meet eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less power than the previous generation of electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a nominal transmission during page reversal.
But transmissions are stronger when the device downloads or sends data.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favored reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into the airlines and flew them to test the problems, but no such problems were found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Aviation Passenger Association, said he believes the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the disruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order the passengers to switch off the device at the time of landing the aircraft in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and described them as a common-sense facility for people travelling in the latest phases of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said: "We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that the passenger traveling with pleasure is not incompatible with safety and security.
Learning from the serial bomb blasts in Patna, the UT Police has geared up for a quick reaction during Diwali celebrations and emergency situations in view of security.
A total of 1,800 constables, including vehicles and pedestrians, will be patrolling at all major points of the city, crowded markets and other places to ensure smooth movement of traffic, prevention of incidents of stampede, teaching of manhandls and other incidents.
These personnel will include women police personnel including PCR, traffic unit.
Police personnel and commandos will also conduct vigilance checks at hotels, guest houses and PG locations in the city.
The SHO has been directed to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the case.
The DSP has also been entrusted with the responsibility of conducting investigations in markets, malls and other places, including in the VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the high officials have also fixed additional police personnel duties in the police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police, along with the fire brigade and PGI directors, the principal directors and DHS, the staff of the Sector 16 GMSH and the Sector 32 GMCH management, were asked to be on high alert during the emergency.
To teach the manchals a lesson, the departmental authorities have now appointed women police personnel, among others, as 'anti-gunda staff' under the leadership of NGOs.
The police personnel of the Anti-Gunda Staff Team, dressed in plain clothes, will be on standby at crowded places including markets.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to install 44 nakas in the interiors of the city.
Police personnel will also be deployed at 38 naka points on the city's borders.
The bird was released back into the forest by air transport for protection from the North Sea rig
The bird found dead on the North Sea oil rig has been released back into the forest from the coast by air transport.
The bird, named Water Rail, was sent to Aberdeen by helicopter before being recovered by the Scottish SPCA back to their rescue centre in Eloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon reported: “This water train was probably the winter migrant bird of northern Europe, hit by strong winds over the North Sea.”
The bird seemed to be tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He further explained that: “It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help.”
Before leaving, the water rail had become healthy and fit.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring business together and determine what changes we want to see in our relationship with the UK's employment and prosperity maker EU.
For this, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought about the UK business with the EU.
U-Gov took the idea of 1000 business leaders representing the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large portion of businessmen now want to export outside of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritise new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than being involved in the long-term and arduous process of reform of the EU's secret institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas, ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say the price of Brussels' regulation far exceeds the benefits of being part of Europe's trading sector - even 40 percent of the huge businessmen who traditionally favored European companies agreed.
Finally and most frankly, our survey of business leaders found that, for the most part, the UK clearly wants to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change, rather than politics with the EU.
The findings, which were seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen were driving a "substantial change" that would give the UK its lost power back.
It has a very high price - the issue of a treaty change for Britain and a better deal led to a 16 percent change in the vote-collection in favor of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this survey shows that UK businessmen support his plan to hold talks on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also demonstrated that businessmen expect to renegotiate while making a meaningful change to favour the current power balance in the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly mandatory, as the eurozone, the associated economy, and the fiscal union move forward.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show, for businessmen, this means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the regulation of Brussels.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new phase
The head of Gazprom said the start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today is a historic event: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said a dispute over a contract between Gazprom’s Counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where Russia’s gas supplies to Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant an end to "forever" the gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
After the completion of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
Two YMCA NSW employees have been charged with child sex crimes before they were charged with caring for child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in its statement before the Commission, it said it had "never reported a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the Commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which the YMCA Caringbah Gym Instructor was charged with child sexual abuse against children who were in her care in 1991.
Mr Hare, from the commission's assisted advocate Gail Farnese, said he was aware of the case earlier but was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that YMCA's statement before the Commission that "YMCA has been externally examined and they have found YMCA at the forefront of child protection" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified, and it secured the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is 21 years old with the YMCA, admitted that the management "including myself" had failed due to Lord's appointment, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations relating to reporting child protection policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during his two-year tenure at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years imprisonment.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in YMCA, due to which the staff did not report a child safety violation by the Lord.
The staff looked at the violations, including Lord's spending time alone with children, getting them to be babysitting in private, sitting on their lap, telling them that he loved them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and she had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about her behavior, testified that YMCA Caringbah Child Service Manager Jackie Barnat, who supervised Lord was "very intimidating and hard to find most of the time."
The CEO stated that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
He said that rather, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW Mandal that the text from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not giving information to the organization."
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees immediately after the allegations surfaced was made by Child Services Manager of YMCA, Liam Whiteley.
He said that the purpose was to avoid the mixing of evidence, but it was "exaggerated" and not executed correctly.
Stephen Smallbone, special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's work between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the appointment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like to have the chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes a return is unlikely.
In an interview conducted last night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, the 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, Mr. Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and peacekeepers of the Middle East group.
When asked if he would like to return to the office, Mr. Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts performing the horse for the best horse of the year gathered in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school and a few months away from taking his first step, the little boy and his Palot Shetland pony Taffy easily completed the three stages and won the top prize - he overtook his 30 adult competitors.
At the annual competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudry, near Cardiff, the unbreakable pair - which is the same length - was highly praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, he slanted his flat hat at a rough angle and put his two-year-old toffee around the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control, which is far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March, and he has practiced with this pony from Shetland daily since then.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are fantastic pairings."
He faced a challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most different in this playground, he seemed so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take a photo with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantiglo near Ab Well, South Wales, has been following the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was cheering and clapping."
He was running on sand throughout the landscape, and despite his small appearance, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a madman of animals - he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two hens he cares for.
The way he's started, he'll be at the best horse show of the year a long time ago - and I'm sure he'll do very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his pony.”
They are very good couples.
The decision-makers gave points considering the manner in which Fenton and Toffee performed and the manner in which they performed in the show ring.
He saw good team work between the pony and his rider - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring in this case.
I'm pretty sure Fenton's cute clothes have helped him, he really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be a "revitalization" of the
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
The newspaper New Express in Guangzhou had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write fake news about a state-owned company.
The regulator said that now New Express has to go through "full improvement."
The order of "correction" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company Zoomlion in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was disorderly."
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative punishment by revoking the license of the reporter of Chen Yongzhou."
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the New Express, recommending that the New Express investigate those responsible for it and immediately revise the New Express leadership team."
Mr. Chen wrote in New Express many articles blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, saying he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came on state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
"In this case, I have harmed Joomla, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr Chen's apology, the New Express issued a homepage apology, saying it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have confessed to TV broadcasting.
Experts say that from time to time, forcibly acquittals are made, despite a law in the latter part of this year prohibiting authorities from forcing a person to plead guilty.

He lauded the efforts of the Shri Hindu Nyaya Bench to connect children with the culture of the eternal.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is necessary to impart religious education to children, including worldly education.
A U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel has found its own railway.
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot-tall three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is approximately the same length as the six football pitches, which connect Tijuana, a warehouse near Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being drug-filled.
Officials said it was closed before a drug was passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three persons, who were reported to have been working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in jail.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered since Central Mexico's marijuana crop in October, which poses a challenge to drug mafia groups capable of delivering the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found a route of about 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks, that stretched from the reservoir of a house in Tijuana to the San Diego warehouses.
Congress candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat has filed his nomination papers for the Lok Sabha elections.
A total of seven candidates, including the BJP and the Congress, filed their nominations on Thursday, including one and two Independents from the National People's Party.

The British police have sent a notice to the
The British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, as well as said that he would himself be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences, and his options under British law expire when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the U.S., he requested asylum at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokeswoman said Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to be present at the police station on the date and time we chose."
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges, due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-secret website called WikiLeaks.
A fine of <0xC2><0xA3>1000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph with a hot drink between legs
The driver has been fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by keeping a hot drink between the legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes-Benz at A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink on their feet.
In the Colchester Magistrates Court, Howe pleaded guilty to negligent driving.
Seven points were added to his license, as a result of which he was banned from driving for six months.
He was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>90) and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>100).
Taxes on foreign property owners will put an end to London's artificial state of affairs
The Finance Department has compiled the CGT measures provisionally, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent in the 2012 budget for homes valued at more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, and individuals who prefer to own a house in a company rather than a separate individual.
In the tax year 2012/13, the stamp duty on residential properties in the towns of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea stood at <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, more than the combined sum of North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr Cook pointed out: “After the increase in the stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that higher-value property has less than fair taxation, which has nothing to do with the impact of the old council tax system.
"But this move could silence some foreign investors in buying properties in London and make them reluctant to sell to current owners," he added.
The prime property, the top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market by value in the wealthiest south-west London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8 per cent last year.
According to Saviles' research, central London's prices continued to rise by 5.6 percent each year, but seemed a little lower than the growing "domestic market" as the city's Southwest, North (7.4 percent) and East (6.5 percent) saw a surge.
Scientists have further highlighted what is the relationship between the movements of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while restless dogs move their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and react to it.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
Georgia Vellartigara, neuroscientist professor from the University of Trento, said: “In humans it’s all well-known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved differently in the stimulation that produces positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that even in dogs like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-hand movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to one-sided sneezing by other dogs, researchers tracked animals watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take much time to understand why their chin sometimes moves on one side and on the other.
Prof. Vellartigara pointed out: “We introduced dogs with dogs movies – in a realistic version or in a photo-picture to deal with other issues that were confusing, and we could see the tail movements and present the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw an emotionless dog moving its tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail shifting to the left (from the dog's point of view) mainly to the left, their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigara, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these acts.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned this from their experience about what movements they should be concerned about and not on.
He said: “If you’ve met other dogs several times, and if they constantly shake their tails to one side it’s related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
Researchers say these findings may provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with a better understanding of the animal's feelings.
John Bradshaw, a visitor to the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he pointed out: “In contrast to the Italian study – when the robot dog’s tail was moved to the left rather than to the right, dogs were more likely to approach it than to be restless.”
He said the difference was because in different studies dogs were not fully understanding animals or robot dogs in films.
He explained that this could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be found - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably won’t take much time to understand why their dum sometimes moves on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow Gig due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock bank Arctic Monkeys has postponed the gig in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered a lung injury.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But the illness of his lead singer Alex Turner forced him to re-determine the date of the show.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were obliged to postpone the gig in a similar manner at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone the show tonight at the LG Arena in Birmingham after receiving medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on November 1, Friday."
"Alex Turner was found to have had a lung disease in the investigation, and he is sadly not able to perform."
The show will now take place at LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, and at Glasgow Hydro on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for this event.

Pope Francis to announce first cardinal's name in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
The Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergymen in the Catholic Church, their ranks are only below that of the Pope, and they are the ones who choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his personalities, which will eventually help in choosing his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope's election - it falls into the group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony for the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, known as the pope-sabha.
“Pope Francis has decided to pre-empt his decision to hold the February Pope-Council, so as to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said that in general, the cardinals are as low as 120, the cardinals as many as they wish, and the cardinals over 80 years of age as they wish.
Valero said the next year's pope's meeting would be crucial as it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope, as well as the Cardinals from the rest of the world, are nominated to restore balance," he said.
There are forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their numbers in the Cardinals are very low.
The Cardinals Council - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to find ways to reform the church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis has been appointed.
Before that, the pope had to decide everything on his own.
“Right now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's totally new.
Valero said that usually the Pope gives the post of cardinal to the bishops of large places, but Francis was "totally going to be surprised - so we don't know whose names they would announce."
GM recalls pickup trucks in U.S. to correct seatback
General Motors, its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks have recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a hand-drawn seatback, according to a report by U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.
Some trucks may have a deficiency in front seat rotating system.
As a result, the seatback failed to comply with the Union Auto Safety Standards regarding the head restructuring.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is stuck behind, it is possible that the head restraint may not properly protect the driver, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began to be shipped in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, it marks the most important wagon launch for the top U.S. automaker.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The NSTMA could not review the notification letter due to a 16-day government shutdown, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had gained 1.4 per cent.
The Disappointment of Obama's Electorate
"I voted for Obama twice, rather than for a change.
He says Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the GOP's policy of blocking
Obamacare website's troubles, drone attacks can't be excused
Obama's memoir of the 2008 campaign reminds me of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading a lot of sad books today.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during the second year of medical school and give me a ray of hope.
It's called "The Courage to Win," and it's a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I find leisure from my patient’s beds at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved unilateral, and news speakers took a pause to reflect the historical significance of the time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A group of young visionaries were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 percent.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh reality, like coming back from a dream world.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a tragic memory of lost opportunities.
What really changed after I went to vote for the first time.
To put it simply, I could not have imagined any of it.
I owe Obama a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask" and until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of partisan opposition has hampered many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public alternatives to healthcare, closure of bases at Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But the countless times in which I took myself to the side of the Obama administration in front of colleagues and colleagues, I have an answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republican opposition's policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens nor can respond to prosecutions of people who expose the wrongful acts of the government.
It cannot explain the murder of US citizen Anwar El Awlaki without trial, nor the reduction in public funds and expenditure limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot respond to the findings of the report, which says the White House's efforts to silence the media "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration."
And more recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed into law by the Affordable Care Act.
I don’t know if I expected that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a predictable path, as opposition political parties and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet all the examples I have given above seem to have been chosen by the administration for the most part.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and indefinite alternative that did not seem to dictate his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama’s approval rating is below 45 percent this week, it has become much harder to return to the year 2008 through that book.
When I look at him, I remember his lost words.
I was reading a portion of the book this week, describing how Obama in the Pennsylvania primary did not cause much damage to Clinton.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they need to get back on track, and remain loyal to their objectives.
"I want to get my mojo back," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that PM Tony Abbott's interest in paternity leave plan is conflicted
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the paternity leave plan is in conflict as his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in determining whether carbon and mining taxes are lowered.
But Mr Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have conflict of interest, and said Mr Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"In the case of paid paternity leave, they may have a significant interest conflict, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest whether they get a leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after he fell again.
Mr. Palmer called for the restoration of the election count in order to speed up the process.
Tony Aout's daughters François and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we have voted?
"We should have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which we can enter our description on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
That's because if someone doesn't like it, they can delete it.
In today's time, it seems absurd to use a pencil.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint deliberations with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he takes his new work "very seriously."
Public office is for public service.
“We don’t need any other award other than the history award that we can serve the community at this critical time,” he said.
This caused inconvenience to the complainants.
Addressing the gathering, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anger over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said the growing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that criminals have become fearless.
They have no fear of the police or the administration.
Referring to such incidents in different places in the recent past, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily ascertained.
RBS Suspended Two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, receiving this information from two experts from the case, another indication that the global scrutiny carried out by regulators in the suspected manipulation of the currency market is moving at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, with $5.3 trillion in exchanges each day.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the investigations into the Libor interbank loan manipulation case appears to be a recurring one.
The bank has declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
"Our investigation into this case is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, case-sensitive people said RBS had sent emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to the former trader.
The trader, Richard Eusher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been fired from his current position as the European Head of Forex Spot Trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramachandani, head of European spot trading in City, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts from the case said Mr. Youshar's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after it was informed by Swiss regulator Finma that it was investigating the suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority VECO, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of bankers being compromised for their favourable volatility in the currency market.
Those familiar with the matter said that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks have been scrutinizing instant messages and emails for years in search of clues to a wrong activity.
The news about the investigation has created a stir among traders in the sector who have been among the top earners in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing a challenge this year as opportunities for speculators have declined due to low volatility in currencies.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks despite the extremely large volume of forex buying and selling means that "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced the trader would be disqualified this week from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London, which lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe that the trader acted alone, and has been controlled," said Credit Suisse.
Students studying technical and management courses, including those running on campus, will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Vice-Chancellor has written a letter to the Governor seeking permission to hold elections.
With the admission process in the university, there was a demand for holding student union elections.
He had also launched a signature campaign on the selection of his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
About two dozen courses, including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Sciences, will be selected this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will get the opportunity to exercise franchise for the first time.
The Vice-Chancellor, Prof Ashok Kumar, said that he has sought permission from the Governor to hold elections in the university.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as the permission is given.
"""It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many colleges do not want the management to have student union elections on their campus.
At the same time, due to lack of unity among the students, elections are also not being held.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the elections.
Akash Jaiswal, department coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, the district administration will ask for permission to hold elections in the colleges.
There are also problems with the lack of clarity of the views of the colleges on the students union election.
In Dhanteras, people have made huge purchases of gold and silver from utensils in the capital.
Such purchases have increased by 20-30 per cent compared to the previous year
In Shimla, a large number of people thronged jewellery shops.
There was also a large crowd in the pot shops, which were decorated from the lower market to the Mall Road.
This year, however, there has been an increase in the prices of such products, but people have not been able to make any purchases.
The auspicious day for Friday shopping was from 7:52 a.m. to 10:12 p.m. and from 1:56 a.m. to 3:37 p.m. and from 6:17 p.m. to 8:12 p.m.
At the time of the said three Muhurats, more crowds of people flocked to the suburbs including Shimla for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Market, people did not find a place to stage their feet.
The same goes for every small shop.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, the festival of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month, which is celebrated as Triyodashi Dhanteras, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
In a 5-4 vote, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which required citizens to buy or punish health insurance before the year 2014 as it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Roberts supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thomas, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also supported the remaining 2,700-page articles of the law, and said that the condition of the healthcare law that states should increase Medicaid eligibility or that all federal Medicaid funding would be lost is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NCB) to curb the law.
The law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates during the early 2012 season, including projectile nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that our work cannot be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to assume it all.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the auspicious day of Krishna Triyodashi in the month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshipped as Kubera, the god of wealth, and Yamaraj, the god of death.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
We have a bad feeling about money.
There is nothing more valuable than the wealth which has served the welfare of humanity, but the wealth which has caused egoism has no meaning.
Let us earn money for holy purposes and spend it for holy purposes only.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to accumulate uncounted wealth or earn yen - ken destroys our conscience and personality.
The spirit of charity should always remain in the mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also become the basis of one's life.
Many people in society are living in dire shortcomings, for which we should all think.
In fact, in the Puranas of life, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance.
Everyone wants wealth and success, and according to their merit, they also get wealth and success.
It is the same wealth that is sustainable with which respect is attached.
No matter how rich a criminal is, he can neither consume it properly nor benefit anyone else.
Don't give money to someone else if you have money.
True wealth is the one who makes the way to flow into the infinite hands of wealth.
There can be no greater use of money than the creation of employment for others.
One more thing, money is not just money.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Make sure you are the owner of this property.

Special Judge Isis Mehta, after hearing the closed-door case, accepted the NIA plea and sent Ahmed to 14-day remand.
While presenting Uzair Ahmed before the court, the NIA said Uzair Ahmed was mainly involved in the incident along with Imtiyaz Ansari and Haider, a member of the Indian Mujahideen, the prime accused in the Patna serial blasts.
Ahmed had introduced several other terrorists to Ansari.
The NIA also wants to arrest the other accused in the case through questioning of Ahmed.
In this case, the search for the bomb-making material and the terrorists who made it is still underway.
For this, he has to take Ahmed to Bihar, Jharkhand and several states, for which he needs to be remanded.
The NIA had arrested Uzair Ahmed on October 30 from Ranchi in connection with the Patna serial blasts case.
The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed that the PMT of 2012 was fake.
The STF has found the roll number of 700 students in the probe to be faulty.
As many as 125 students took admission in medical colleges.
These students can now be removed.
Following the disclosures of the STF, the medical education department has started brainstorming to cancel the admissions of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting to meet the list of all these suspected students from the STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam to revoke the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also asking for legal advice in this regard.
The departmental officials said that since the students who took admission in 2012 have completed one year, it is important to seek legal advice in this regard.
As the case is currently limited to STF investigation, the officials of the Medical Education Department are not in a position to say anything.
Vyapam director Tarun Pithore said if the STF submits a list of suspects along with evidence, their admissions will be cancelled immediately.
Director Medical Education Dr Nirbhay Srivastava said that the students have not even refused to cancel their admission if they are found to be fake.
According to the STF officials, the fake students involved in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After the investigation, the list of suspects will be handed over to Vyapam.
It may be recalled that Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 suspected students who appeared for the PMT examination in 2013.
Out of these 345, the Medical Education Department has so far cancelled 84 admissions.
Aijaz Jan, MLA from Poonch Assembly constituency, inaugurated the water cooler at the Gurudwara complex.
The MLA said a large number of people used to come and go at the gurdwara but due to lack of proper drinking water supply, the water cooler has been installed here.
This will allow people to get cold water on hot days.
During the winter, clean water will be available.
This will solve the problem of drinking water for the devotees.
Members of the Gurudwara Committee were also present on the occasion.
If the new government continues its policy to discontinue the sale of kerosene through rations after the general elections, kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where kerosene has been discontinued include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, the sale of kerosene is also set to be stopped in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states.
According to sources in the petroleum ministry, it will be decided to discontinue the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
The first is the rapid construction of electricity connections in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made elaborate arrangements in this regard.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota has been significantly reduced for Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota in Punjab has been reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to 1 lakh kg.
In Uttarakhand, kerosene quota was reduced by 70 per cent, while in Haryana, kerosene quota was reduced by 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of kerosene deficiency from these states.
The ministry is acknowledging that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
At present, there is a difference of Rs 37 between the price of PDS kerosene and diesel.
This encourages people to mix.
In states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 a litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore in 2013-14
The accused used to forger in the name of buying and selling shares by opening investor accounts by referring to the trading firm.
This is perhaps the first time such a revelation has come to the fore in the state.
Police have not been able to identify who is the leader of the gang, but seven people, including the accused, have been detained in the state.
The gang operated a fake commodity market called MetaTrader 5.
The companys creditors used to take cash from investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
This allowed the accused to see the shares bought by the investors when they were trading.
It was also known at what price the shares were bought.
In fact, no shares were bought or transacted, as no demat account of investors was opened and the shares on this fake software were shown as false.
Police suspect that hundreds of people were involved in the attack.
Every investor was allowed to invest between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh in the name of profit.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur while six of his associates have been arrested from Indore.
According to the ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohere, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
After that, the company can trade the shares through its investors.
Then the demat account of the investor is opened so that the shares can be bought and sold for it, but this company named MetaTrader 5 was neither associated with any exchange nor used to conduct stock trading.
The company had purchased the server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been cheated in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight Indore-based traders have filed complaints in the cyber cell.
Even after selling his purchased shares in profits, his money was not transferred to his account.
In this, he started asking for profits from the company's operators.
Investors are even saying that on the fake IDs given to them, the price of their purchased shares was always lower.
The accused used to fix the price at their level.
The company has appointed CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The agent advised people to join the company by luring them with more profits.
After this, Rs 2 lakh was deposited from someone and up to Rs 5 lakh was deposited from someone.
On the day of the Tests, the players of this team keep setting new records and now even in the ODIs, their status is gradually increasing.
A good example of this was seen on Thursday when the well-known New Zealand team beat Bangladesh by an unbeaten lead in the ODI series.
Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

BJP`s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune on Friday to inaugurate a part of the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, attacked the Congress.
"Modi said, ""Sometimes a coalition government was formed in several states and at the Centre, sometimes a Congress-communist government, sometimes a BJP government."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What the team did.
If this comes to fruition, then there will be no question before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever there is a BJP government, efforts have been made to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the low inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had two meals a day.
But when the Congress or its backing government was formed, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader has been responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become arrogance.
They don't even respond to the media.
Elections are for the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
Modi is being asked questions on this day. When people will bless BJP in 2014, then every year they will present their work to the people, Modi said, while attacking Congress leader Kapil Sibal.
In a democracy, there is no ruler in Delhi, the servant should sit.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Friends of the Congress are leaving the balloons on the day they arrive.
Friends, we have given the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people take the test.
Google, Samsung and Huawei have been accused of patent infringement.
The group, owned by thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed several patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it overtook in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, an association that bought Noretel patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents also include technology that combines search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, which is a key part of Google's search business, the prosecution said.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely contested by Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google eventually offered $4.4 billion, increasing bids several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons for which Motorola had to have a long list of patents.
"Google has violated, and continues to violate, despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suit in the auction," the lawsuit said.
Rockstar has sought increased compensation against Google, as it claims that the patent infringement by Google is arbitrary.
Believed in the first independently elected president in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his victory day hardly brought an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi, 16 months ago, promised "new Egypt" while taking the oath of office as the country's first independently elected president to replace removed Hosni Mubarak.
On its formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first independently elected Islamic president of the Arab world, and the fifth president of Egypt after the monarchy was ousted nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on his chair in front of 18 judges of the court wearing black robes, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic,"" Morsi said at a formal ceremony broadcast live on national television."
The radical Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an unlawful organization since its inception, and which has been targeted by previous governments, said Morsi, a 60-year-old U.S.-trained engineer of the party, "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and arrived in small convoys of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, the traffic was also stopped for a while, so that his motor convoy would be diverted from a generally busy road linking the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal prestige, ridiculed as a non-Karishmai "empty tyre" of the Brotherhood, rose sharply after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for all those who want to complete the 2011 revolution against the dictator Mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden paneled chamber, saying that "Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern nation."
He then moved to Morsi Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by the military band playing the national tune while they stood in the posture of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people in the lecture room at the main university there were greeted with the slogan "Army and people are one hand".
Established in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Teheran Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and took an oath to withdraw the military council's powers taken from his position by the leader who was ousted last year.
But by traditionally agreeing to take an official oath before the Court instead of taking the competent oath of Parliament, they bow to the will of the Army, which is an indication that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in the Tehreek Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Meanwhile, a key U.S. Senate committee has approved a bill restricting surveillance activities by the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its objective is to make surveillance more transparent and to restore the trust among the people who have been hurt by the widespread phone tapes being exposed.
Six US companies, including Google and Yahoo, have welcomed the Senate move.
The NSA has also breached data centers of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on Friday by 4 votes, 11 against the NSA.
The bill mentions several restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapes under the U.S. Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, the use of unauthorised data will be treated as a crime and a 10-year jail term is provided for.
The bill will become a law after both the Houses of Congress and the Senate have passed it.
"""The NSA's phone recording programme is in accordance with law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the country's security,"" said the committee's chairman and Senator Diane Festin."
But there is still more to be done.
The safety of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill, angered by the NSA's Internet surveillance program being revealed.
In a letter to the senators, the companies said, "We welcome the proposal of the NSA's lawmakers to curb large-scale phone recording.

So you looked like a travel agent in the last century, say thank you to the internet?
The flight center is taking this trend forward.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full-year pre-tax underlying profits to be between $325 million and $340 million, while in the previous forecast it reported between $305 million and $315 million.
If the target is achieved as per current guidance, it will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase in the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said the flight center has made a profit of 8 per cent in the first half, and has made a good start in its second half, especially in non-commercial travel to Australia and the UK.
“As of now, 10 of our countries are in profit, and many countries are on track to record full-year income before interest and tax contributions,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually our most profitable centres.
The leisure business in Australia has regained momentum in the second half, meeting the shortfall of the slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.

The U.S. business had seasonally weakened its ghats in its first half, and is expected to yield a third consecutive full year profit.
Shares of the flight center were trading at $38.20 yesterday, up 3 cents.
A recent media report said that the NSA used data from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was named Muscular, which it carried out in association with its British counter-part-GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data from the huge fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top-secret document dated January 9, 2013, as saying that more than 180 million documents were collected in just three days of the start of the program.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
The program ran outside the US and an anonymous telecommunication provider helped the NSA access this information, according to the Washington Post.
According to the newspaper, it was much easier for the NSA to run the program outside the US as there are court orders required for such operations in the US.
The NSA chief, General Keith Alexander, denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I am aware, this has never happened.
The NSA has always kept all the information within the purview of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the US administration has assured that its communications system will not be monitored.

Schools want to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British story from 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage greater reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be completed.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSEs in the language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow – both of which will be the first subjects to undergo a revolutionary change.
It will also change the other main topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam regulator will display changes in the structure of the GCSE with formal, new grading system, and less syllabus.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove had said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to improve our examination system to restore people's trust", adding that "GCSE will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics — 116 hours a year or 3 hours less a week during a session than in most countries.
According to the comparison, Australian schools offer students an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that combining broader mathematics with more weight with subjects in the GCSE-League table was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems" including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it cannot ask the media not to report on information received from the police or any other source.

There is a guideline for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many other treatments that you can use.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular that make him more troublesome.
These people are damming their image and reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to restrain the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Pawan Bansal, who was surrounded by questions from the opposition at the railway gate, put the opposition in a position by saying that he had not seen a woman in 15 years.
After that, everyone was surprised at where the woman came from.
Perhaps Bansals point was to the domestic relations of a big BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter over, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had planned to lodge a complaint with a woman behind her during the last parliamentary elections, which did not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI had questioned him in connection with the railway bribery case.
If they were to be witnesses, what would they do if they were to be brought to trial?
Bansal said he must have written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam he is talking about.
If they do, they will be punished for their sins.
He said though the corporation had no constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, it asked the opposition to speak on it.
As far as development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a 15-year list of development works, he said.
The way Chandigarh is being developed or is going to be, they cannot even think about it.
The two exchanged greetings at the Cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh lauded the Chief Minister for his retaliatory remarks against Narendra Modi at the Chintan Camp.
He also said about his speech that there is no other emotion in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be tackled.
There was also a feeling on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech in a positive manner.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to pay respect to the workers at the Chintan camp and save them from the alleged harassment of officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to be sacked from the cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, there is a possibility of fresh consideration in the matter of appointing workers to government posts after the opinion emerged in the Chintan Camp.
At the camp, state JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the appointment of workers in the 20-point committees would be announced soon.
They also indicated that the list was almost ready.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is expected to review the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If necessary, the list will be extensively revised to accommodate old and committed workers.
The common allegation of the MLAs and MPs is that they were not taken into consideration in making the nomination list.
The names of those who came from other parties have been included in the list, while many important workers have been neglected since the days of Samata Party.
Some people are born with a silver spoon, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person also has the name of Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani was born on December 28, 1932, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, a teacher at a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was number three among the five siblings.
The family has five children, Ramanikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumi.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of school only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the family financially when he was a child.

In 1949, at the age of 17, Dhirubhai arrived in the Yemeni city of Aden on a ship called Kabota.
Here, his elder brother Ramanikalal had made all arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai’s mind.
So in 1954 they returned to the Vatan.
In 1955, he tried to reach Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket.
This is where his business journey began.
From here Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name was not only popular in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At that time, he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
At present, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of the Sultanate.
Like his father, today the names of these two brothers are also among international businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Srinagar: The security of former minister Ghulam Hasan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party, has been reportedly withdrawn by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security has been removed for political reasons.
Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the 2002 election on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was in his cabinet while Mufti Muhammad Sayeed was the chief minister.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said that I have got security cover since 1996.
I live in what is called a "terrorist camp."
At my house, a security team of CRPF was stationed under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
I also have bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Veeravar.
When the security team was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he said he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted, Kashmir IGP Abdul Gani Mir denied the information, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will personally investigate how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been taken away.
State Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz told PTI that there was no such thing in my knowledge.
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and will be coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, in the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Contrary to Modi's claims, during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as the Prime Minister of the NDA (between 1999 and 2004), there was a period when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-metre-high Statue of Unity at Kevadiya in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, Earlier, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
The DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements of Sardar Patel
When asked about Modi's claims, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's prime ministerial candidate does not talk on facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in the year 2008.
This, he said, was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of Nehru-Gandhi family members every year.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about the difference, Manish Tewari said, It should not be seen from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in a rally in Patna last Sunday.

Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well is delivering free healthcare in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
West African countries don’t have too many physicians; there’s only one physician for 5,000 people
Give your vote here or via mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or for anyone in the other top 10 to make the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father coming to his senses and becoming unconscious, going to the hospital, who was not properly equipped to help him.
Jamel Well was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital, Yunnde, in 1981.
Initially only his hand was broken, but an infection spread to his brain, and he developed hemorrhoids, which affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," says Georges Well.
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vell continued to visit his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals and get all the treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," said Well.
You leave home at 5 a.m. in the hope that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that doesn’t happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people may be waiting in the face of death.
The situation hasn't changed much since Well's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If compared, there is a physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many Cameroon residents can’t afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the private sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of healthcare spending in the country.
"Their only problem is poverty," says Well.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Well decided to solve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have conducted 700 free surgeries last year.
He also became a doctor himself, and began working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yunnde.
And he started the non-profit organization Eskomyum, which goes to rural areas on the weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in vans, tie medical supplies to the rooftops and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to move the vehicle more than once by pushing it from the rivers and the soil.
But when they arrive, they really get the honor of heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.
The free medical services in these villages are indeed a cause for celebration, and the well – with its great smile and endless energy – is happily involved.
The next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people on each trip," said Well.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All of these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get a baguette, donated glasses or free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed at a school building, town hall, or home; after the procedure, the patient moves to a place of recovery, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator lights up the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work early in the morning on Sundays.
It's a waist-breaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They play drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work," said Well.
His team returns to the city on Sunday, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, which includes Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, underwent 700 free surgeries last year, and they know their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said that due to free hernia surgery, she will be able to go back to work.
The man said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Well also works at private medical clinics around the yawn at night.
He explained that this is his second job that finances 60% of his nonprofit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
“I don’t know when they sleep,” said Katy O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer at Well’s group.
They’re always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity that they can never get in their own country.
“We have been able to gain experimental experience in the surgeries we use to help Dr. Well capture tools or clean blood spots,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S. you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students typically spend from their own to arrive in Cameroon, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after the Yande arrives, they come and go, and the cost of the instructions is well worth it.
"There's no doubt they're heroes," O'Malley says.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the Cameroon people is never going to end.
For the well, almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling their promise to their father, these are things that give them a lot of joy.
"I'm very happy doing this work," says Well.
And I think of my father.
I hope they see what I am doing.
I’m doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

Obama's health care reform bill has been repealed.
Amid a shower of criticism, President Obama withdrew his often repeated misleading promise yesterday that “you can continue with your health plan if you like it.”
With millions of people receiving revocation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent times.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
"A lot of people who have health insurance, and that's useful, can continue it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Addressing what he calls a "blast of news" about the revocation, Obama has graced the purchase of new coverage in the market from U.S. citizens receiving these information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, as much money or even a comprehensive health care plan cheaper than the proposed one.
"You'll get a better deal," he said.
It should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage is not in line with the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I tell these American citizens directly, you deserve better."
Sebelius, who has been taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market has been "unfortunate" since October.
"I'm just as disappointed and angry as everyone else."
I want to gain your trust again.
With a colleague sitting behind him at the House hearing yesterday after a heated argument with Republicans, Sebelius said the sentence in anger, which was caught by a Mike. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In a hearing lasting more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which he is now selling to millions of Americans.

In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage "has gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S.’s protective attitude to his surveillance program by admitting that sometimes its espionage “goes too far inappropriately.”
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty along with Barack Obama of being on an "automatic pilot" as a rebellious disclosure to informant Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities unfolding.
This mysticism has brought the U.S. government to a diplomatic realm in its relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr Kerry said: “There is no question that the President, me, and others in the government were really aware of some of the things that happen to an automatic pilot, because looking back at World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, it had its potential in 9/11.”
They have become the first high-class members of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has crossed their borders, but have insisted that no one's rights were abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is currently conducting a thorough review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that the NSA, however, was striving for good cause, and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
He further pointed out: “We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We've actually saved the plane from crashing, demolishing buildings, and killing people because we've been able to learn about others' plans in advance.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said U.S. lawmakers would go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and would try to convince European countries of the need to continue jointly anti-corruption efforts with the U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats from the National Security Agency to stop their participation in anti-terrorist organisations because of their frustration over surveillance.
"It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that European countries be with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts,"" Murphy, first-ever elected of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview to Washington."
European countries need to make it clear that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have led to bitterness in relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said the reports were not entirely accurate, and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the United Nations by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top leaders in the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the espionage of allied countries as necessary and said it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was making arrangements for a Congress visit, which is likely to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers will be released in the coming days.
He said the work on the project is still going on.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some "impractical relationships" would also have to be abandoned.
European leaders will also have to be honest with their people, with their espionage programs used for years.
“Although we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying,” Murphy said.

A new policy to change the board in municipalities has been initiated.
The Trinamool was recently converted to the board of the Congress-led councillors in the Sanithiya municipality of Virbhum district.
The change was due to the fact that most of the Congress councillors, including the municipal chairman, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of CPI(M), CPI(M) and Forward Bloc have also resorted to the suppression of Trinamool.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy termed it as a good sign for the party.
10 Congress councillors, including Sanithiya municipal chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool Congress, he said.
Some councillors of the Left Front, including the CPI(M), have also taken up the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and as per the number of forces, the Sanithiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that all are in agreement with the plan of development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, CPI(M), CPI(M) and the Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Welcoming worthy leaders of any party to the Trinamool.
Ahead of the November 22 municipal elections in five municipalities, the Trinamool is seen as key in the political circles as the party has shifted to the civic body due to the change of party councillors in the Sanithia municipality.
Earlier, in Left Front-ruled Haldia and Nadia, the Congress-ruled municipal board was also an example of the TMC's takeover.
When the TMC takes over the municipal board in the districts due to change of party, those joining the party receive a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited about the leaders joining the Trinamool by splitting from other parties.
He said that those who have defected from any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
He claims that people's faith is growing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, as a result of which people want to join the TMC.
However, the main opposition party CPI(M) has said that low-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People who are afraid of the terror of the Trinamool Congress are joining it.
The CPI(M) is treating the change in the board of elected local bodies as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to raise its base, but the justification for changing the vote in power has to be questioned.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Thai Prison Period
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, she has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, a Phuket provincial court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of falsely accusing the Thai police of attempting to stop him along with two other men on Sunday morning.
But later, CCTV footage revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after separation from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket admitted to narrating the story when the police questioned Bamfort for two days.
He was remanded in judicial custody before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's care and wanted to bring her back to Australia.
"Obviously it has been a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the sentence order, and has been granted bail on 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the report said she was vacationing in a crabby vacation spot in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being contested by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in a court order extending his sentence to two years and forcing him to stay in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand could also be guilty of trying to improve its poor tourist image.
