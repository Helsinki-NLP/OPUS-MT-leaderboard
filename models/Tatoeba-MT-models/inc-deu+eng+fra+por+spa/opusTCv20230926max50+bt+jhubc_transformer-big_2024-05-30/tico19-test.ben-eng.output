Rapid increase in cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK from 1st January to 15th March 2020
The rising cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show similar trends between the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK, which ensures that while at varying levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving fast in all countries.
Based on the knowledge available from Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units will have to step up preparations for the rapid growth of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a contagious pneumonia case was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus as a functional ingredient is now being referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the disease was named after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
As of today, 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more serious disease that creates a need for hospitalization, while 6% of the infected suffer from serious illnesses that require intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this survey, we are reviewing the trends of COVID-19 cases in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the UK (UK) and comparing them with the Hubei province of China.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the number of cases in the UK with the number of cases in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and the EU
China's COVID-19 has spread more geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently being followed by this country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue on March 5, Spitrey and his colleagues reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by the WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan in Hubei province of China were reported by France on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to the date mentioned, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.
Recovering the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of cases
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only reports the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide from government sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities, and WHO, which are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we counted the 14-day short-circuited cases of COVID-19, thus considering the natural trajectory of COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We have also presented the cumulative number of registered cases in each country as on 15th March 2020 till 8:00 AM and it has been compared with the cases in Italy for the period 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the UK and the EU
The 14-day short-run increase in cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the UK followed the trend in Hubei Province (China) in general (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the number of COVID-19 cases began to increase around February 21 and then sharply increased around February 28, 2020.
This was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in the number of reported cases (complementary materials).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of Italy's numbers with the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
As of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported a comparable total of cases in Italy in just 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the number of cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is progressing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite countries at different stages, despite the varying national public health responses, and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the infected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or an intensive care unit is currently available in only 6% and 1% of cases at the EU/EEA level respectively (data is not shown).
However, these should be systematically collected to cater to the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in Germany in the format of 4.2 beds per 100,000 population from 29.2 to Portugal in 2010–11 showed a large-scale difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (in 2010-11, 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people).
With the prevalence of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, saturated health care capacity modeling conditions have shown that there is a >90% risk of overcrowding of intensive care bed capacity, which is provided in the sixth update to the ECDC's Quick Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
Since the events so far have been in clusters in EU/EEA countries and in some areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically provide a specific regional service to the user population, it is advisable to make available information about the affected and intensive care beds in the method of naming the regional units for the statistical 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is making rapid progress in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the need for health care and especially intensive care, such as those in the affected areas of Italy, to increase the number of COVID-19 patients.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a quick, pre-emptive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection is essential, with a change in approach from suppression to mitigation, since if not implemented in a timely manner, the expected rapid increase in the number of incidents can be attributed to the decision-makers and hospitals who are not able to understand, accept and respond accordingly.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity that countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If it fails, there is a possibility that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused by the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has killed more than 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world and infected more than 80,000 people, bringing a disaster on humanity.
SARS-CoV is similar to its homogeneous virus, which in 2003 caused SARS in thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 can also infect bats and cause the same symptoms through the same procedure.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is less than that of SARS, but it is much more infectious and attacks older men and women than young men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the subject of rapidly developing research.
We will cover the basics about epidemiology of the disease, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, disease speed indicators, and prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the alarming disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were asked to stay indoors for the entire duration of the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly symmetrical to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its associated disease was named COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to more than 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which more than 40,000 patients have been released and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""people's number 1 enemy"" and perhaps more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 articles on COVID-19, including viruses, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published in less than two months from the first report on 7 January 2020 that determined the sequence of viruses isolated from multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in new and rapidly developing subjects.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coV-causing disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, the pandemic in 2012).
We also discussed what we know so far about disease prevention and forecasting and some of the remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered to be non-lethal pathogens in humans that primarily cause about 15% of the 4 common colds.
Of course, in this century, we have encountered twice the highly pathogenic bacterial human CoV, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which began an epidemic in 2003 in China and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and which soon spread to many other countries with severe symptoms and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, the sources of the clusters of pneumonia that were unknown were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal incident in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, health care providers were informed of the infection, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down and all its public transport was shut down.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 said that out of 41 confirmed patients, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood (Seafood) market, which is considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation escalates rapidly, the final magnitude and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric survey of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has mainly been found in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 of the infected persons were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 outbreak in and around Hubei has spread to other parts of the world.
From the onset of COVID-19 to the diagnosis, it takes an average of 5 (2-9) days.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the onset of the disease to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial fertility number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the coordinated R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the mass transit period before the Chinese Spring Festival, increased rapidly.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the cumulative mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subspecies of large and wrapped viruses containing a single formula of RNA.
They can be divided into four groups, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among which alpha and beta-coV are known to infect people.
The wrapping wedge for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, binds to its cellular consumer angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4), and then membrane adhesion.
Viral RNA is released into the genome cytoplasm; after replicating the viral genome, genomic RNA with envelop glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then mix with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identities among the 10 sequenced samples collected from the Wuhan marine food market in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than MES-CoV.
Through an electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultrafine part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
It was reported that human ACE2 was a receptor in the case of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are relatively weakly bound to human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, which is conclusive in the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms a fancy small protein encoded by orf3b and can also form proteins encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in the ability to cause viral diseases and inhibit the release of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not have any known functional fields or patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in mixed ingredients, including the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixed material with open and closed adaptation was combined as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixed material could bind two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and transmission of CoV.
In order to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing.
Original and Intermediate Dresser
It has been reported that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and have spread to humans through civet cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing a phylogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other coVs, bats were considered to be the natural host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% equivalent to two SARS-like viruses derived from bats called bats-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which of the intermediate host viruses helped to overcome the barriers of the species to infect humans, and the pathway of infection remains to be explained in detail.
Ji and others that presented the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that is associated with homologous recombination in S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that the potential intermediate of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology in 99% of the pangolin, amphibian mammals—which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine—discovered between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a big difference; that's why conclusive results are still awaited for firm evidence (Figure.33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in a dry environment outside the body and up to 5 days in low temperatures of 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes in heat; disinfectant containing ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine, paracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore they are at risk of being infected with the novel virus.
There is currently no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only see previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
Usually, after entering a virus pose, it is first identified by the receptors of pattern detection. These receptors include C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors, and RIG-like receptors.
Through a variety of pathways, the virus induces the manifestation of inflammatory substances, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the transmission of viruses and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from immune system reactions.
Soon, adaptive immune responses also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in resistance.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T-Helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the action of T cells by inducing the death of T cells.
The body's immune system, along with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients prevent MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive sensitivity to the immune system creates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario, multi-organ alterations can even lead to death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections characterized by congestive heart disease are more likely to harm older people and pregnant women with pre-diseases.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have a weakened immune system are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days.
However, studies on 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period of the disease was 3 days on average and the duration was 0 to 24 days.
The most recent study, as described above, showed that the exposure period of 8,866 patients based on the population was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the exposure period of the most accurate pathogens, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected but symptomatic people to others.
As a general rule, people infected or exposed to the virus are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
In almost all cases, fever is the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, drowsiness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhemia, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the onset of the disease, some patients felt dyspnea (breathing) and/or hypoxemia.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation.
Patients with fever and/or shortness of breath and severe fever do not even have pulmonary imaging abnormalities but need to be tested for the virus in early diagnosis.
A demographic survey in late December 2019 found that 98% of the percentage of symptoms had a fever, 76% had a dry cough, 55% had dyspnea, and 3% had diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies reported similar findings in a class of clots (family clusters) and a clot (clusters) caused by infections from a symptomatic person.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 found that MERS-CoV patients had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which is much higher than COVID-19 patients and is consistent with MERS's higher ventilation capacity than COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
Among SARS patients, it was proved that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat pain (13)-25%) were the main symptoms and around 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
As of February 14, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while the confirmed cases reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS had a mortality rate as of November 2002, with 8,096 confirmed cases at 10%.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
A previous study reported that 95% of 5.71-7.23s were higher than SARS-CoV-2's R0 at 6.47, including the Confidence Interval (CI), where R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 is presented in Table 1.1 in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The numbers above indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, controlling the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
The disease often begins in the same family or in the same gathering or in vehicles such as ships at sea.
Patients often have a history of coming in contact with the infected person or patient in the last two weeks of traveling or living or showing symptoms in Wuhan or other infected places.
However, the report found that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovered patients released from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or less.
For example, the number of white blood cells including lymphocytes in 1,099 COVID-19 patients <0x3C>1 <0xC3><0x97> 109 /L <0x3C>4 <0xC3><0x97> 109 /L. The number of lymphocytes in lymphocytes and increased aspirin aminotransferase levels in lymphocytes and viremia was found.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and pancreas stimulants and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients had increased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte in the blood.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, which is a fibrin corrosive product present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are characterized by a lateral uneven shadow or opacity of frosted glass in the lungs.
Patients are often seen with symptomatic pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid retention, and progressive fibrosis seriously endanger the gas exchange.
The abnormal action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface-tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung weakening.
Therefore, the worst types of chest radiographic searches are often seen in the most serious cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed multinucleated synsytial cells in pneumocytosis, hyalin membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the lungs of a deceased person with the disease, which are also compatible with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the extremely high error-negative rates, which could accelerate the pandemic, in China, from February 13, 2020, clinical or diagnostic manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation exists in the case of SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the connection of disease history, diagnostic displays, laboratory tests and radiological investigations are necessary and necessary for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHERLOCK) strategy to determine SARS-CoV-2, which uses dipstic in less than one hour without the need for expanded materials. Determining 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 ml/L in RNA-particles at 10 microliters per input.
It is expected that the new strategy can dramatically increase sensitivity and usefulness if the diagnostic sample is verified.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoV, doctors may provide primary supportive care to COVID-19 patients, as well as prior use for the treatment of other coV-types such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus-causing diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immune response suppression, steroids, recovered patients plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support current and potential treatments.
It was also suggested to use plasma from patients who have recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and also possibly attacks other organs in low doses that release ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Yet, respiratory insufficiency and dysfunction are the main threats and the leading cause of death in patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to mitigate symptoms and it saves lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, ventilation that does not have to be crushed, and mechanical ventilation that has to be crushed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used in the treatment of lethal cardiac or respiratory disorders.
It is also essential to balance electrolytes in SARS-CoV-2 patients, to prevent and treat indirect infections and septic shock, and to protect the functioning of vital organs.
It has been reported that an excessive response to the immune system in SARS and MERS patients results in a cytokine catastrophe.
The cytokine disaster is a form of inflammatory response to the cytokine present through the release of classes of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines release a large number of free radicals through immune cells, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Prevention response to treatment of cytokine disaster is essential, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, which are an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine dysfunction.
Other immune responses to the cytokine disaster include correction of T cell-directed immune responses; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF inhibitor; JAK mitigation; blanitumobab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC mitigators.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
Although high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which dramatically affects the chance of healing.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be used discreetly for patients with severe COVID-19.
No effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed at the time of writing.
However, the intravenous application of Remdesivir, including nucleotide analogues, has proven to be effective in favor of a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Gillid to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed possible resistance to RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gillead provided the compound to China to run a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly expected.
Baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after treatment combined with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
It has a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from falling prey to the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies in terms of pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against germs and other extraterrestrial objects, and they detect and mitigate pathogens' distinct molecules directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected in 10 patients who were seriously ill.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it the inflammation and viral load decreased and oxygen saturation in the blood was improved.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed, and verification and clarification are necessary to propose a method for mass use before that.
Also, in terms of the medical effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can exacerbate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially deadly toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce antibodies at a specific stage in the fight against the global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and fruitful to identify genetic codes to isolate B cells from recovered patients and monitor effective antibodies against the virus's essential proteins or to encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects depend on a large amount of a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most of the effective components are unknown or unclear, since such components or optimal combinations of them are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, in the absence of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients returning from severe stages.
For example, it was known that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
Many states in China, where TCM is used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, have the highest recovery rate in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where TCM was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the lowest recovery rate was (13%).
However, this is a fairly gross comparison because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing WM and TCM combined treatments with Western medicine (WM) treatments.
They found that the body temperature was significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than it was in the WM<0x2B>TCM group only for the time required to return to normal, relieve symptoms, and hospitalization.
Most interestingly, the latency decline rate (light to severe) was significantly lower than that of the WM team only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the death rate of the WM<0x2B>TCM team was lower than that of the WM team only (8.8% versus 39%).
Despite this, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is awaited at greater levels and even more centres for more well-regulated testing.
It will also be interesting to identify the work process and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatment or their combinations.
Most of the patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are highly infectious and even have a fear of dying, and people in quarantine also experience loneliness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough, and adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to more anxiety and stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, various types of Psychiatric symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor exacerbations, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, compulsive contact tracing and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt about the impact of infections, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and people who have come in contact with them as well as people who need it.
Psychic support should include the formation of mental health teams from multiple branches of medical science, regular and accurate updates about the outbreak and medical planning of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the chain of infection from animal reservoirs and infected people to sensitive pets, and are often supplemented with antiviral treatments to control the epidemic caused by these revealing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and strong immune antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
However, prior to starting a medical study, the effectiveness of these immunocompromised candidates in older people and in the lethal-challenge model has not yet been determined, and their protection against virus infections transmitted from animal sources to humans.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the contrary, disseminated incidents and MERS convulsions continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the existence of zoonotic sources in the affected areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Preparing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-infectious people is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the need for a long time (average 18 months) for vaccine development and the dynamic changes in CoVs.
As a novel disease, the entire diagnostic course of COVID-19 has just begun to mature for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly, except for the pre-existing condition.
But similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a much higher illness and mortality rate in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is essential for health-care agencies, especially in areas with limited resources, to create a prevalence model of the disease to prioritise their services.
Based on clinical studies so far reported, the following factors may influence or be associated with patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the outcome of SARS disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a survey of 8,866 cases described above, COVID-19 mainly occurred in 30-65 years of age, including 47.7% of patients who were above 50.
Patients who were in need of intensive care were also more likely to have other illnesses and complications at the same time and were significantly older than others (66 years of middle age vs. 51 years of middle age) indicating age as a factor in the pace of the disease for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: Men have had SARS-CoV-2 infections more than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
The existence and complexity of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart attack and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It has also been reported that the ACE2-positive colangiocyte may also bind to SARS-CoV-2, which may result in defective liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It should be borne in mind that age and underlying diseases are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Unusual information found in the laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to the tissues and have been suggested as a subject of disease, therapy response, and the speed of possible disease for final healing.
The correlation between the severity and predictability of COVID-19 with the CRP level was also proposed.
In addition, raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine caninease (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely released in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are excreted during cell damage.
Therefore, these are traditional markers for heart failure or liver failure.
Major Diagnostic Symptoms: Periodic progression of chest radiography and diagnostic symptoms must be considered together with other problems for predicting the complexity and consequences of COVID-19.
Usage of steroids: As described above, to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an accessory treatment for infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with long-term disability and low standard of living.
So, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic often endured long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and were under unusual psychological stress as they saw patients fall in the face of death from close family members and others.
It is essential to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help these patients get rid of stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seem to be different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating at the bottom of the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate at the top of the respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, which is similar to other CoVs that are responsible for common cold.
Thus, patients who suffer from early stage or during the outbreak of the disease can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily work, which makes it very difficult to control the pandemic.
However, SARS-CoV infections were considered to occur when patients became seriously ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, great efforts are being made in China, including the lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities in hopes of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the quarantining of almost the entire population.
While these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown of the pandemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the downward phase of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others speculated that COVID-19, which is proven to be more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbine and throat redness in patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital two weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus would become the same cycle phase as the influenza.
However, there are optimistic indications in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may continue to work.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause one million cases, including half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been kept under control.
It is also possible that just like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become weakened in the case of infection and eventually destroy or become a relatively less infectious virus in co-existing with humans.
Below is a comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible even by coughing or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with contaminated substances by the virus.
The virus was also found in malls that highlighted new possibilities for mal-to-mouth infections.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of the cases were likely caused by nasocomial infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, it is necessary to take adequate precautions to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even those close to patients or affected people.
Wearing a mask can be used as the first stage of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23> 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
A surgical face mask prevents small droplets of liquid from a potentially infected person from being airborne or trapped on the surface of an object, from which they can be spread to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23> 1860s) masks can protect against inhalation of small viruses such as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virus is able to fully penetrate; the SARS-CoV-2 size is equal to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can even enter through five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come in direct contact with patients must wear a N95 (Series <0x23> 1860s) mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit, in order to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus was likely to enter his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear a transparent face covering or goggles while working with patients.
In the case of people in affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and at higher doses to limit exposure to potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate for a person to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus in the human world, China should have taken high precautions based on a deeper memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV according to a report on 7 January 2020.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Centers for Disease Control in Wuhan comforted the citizens by saying that the novel virus is less infectious and has limited reproductive capacity from human to human and there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message significantly eased the public's fears, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and wasted significant time in Wuhan to curb the disease to a minimum.
China's disease control agencies can take this rigorous education and make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations need to be more careful when making (1) public announcements because every word will be taken into consideration by citizens and it may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) doctors or officials must be more sensitive and responsive to unsolicited information received from clinics without waiting for a formal report; (3) to be more effective in responding to the feedback and testing of the public at an early stage rather than trying to console the public; and (4) to be more vigilant in preventing the potential pandemic; and more often.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and at the time of writing this report, it has spread to about 50 more countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and similar to the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of return for SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary for epidemic prevention and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than in young people.
The SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even in symptomatic conditions, on the other hand, SARS patients usually do so in critically ill conditions, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This is partly explaining why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more extensively than SARS-CoV-2.
Regular RNA assessments for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can again be positive in terms of the virus.
These discoveries dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Considering the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be addressed as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-Nya CoVs, we have not yet come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, such as bats to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we will not be able to effectively reduce the spread of infection and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cell and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also block the ACE2-containing cells of other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus spread genetically in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, a SARS-like death, or a flu-like re-epidation at some point in time?
It's important, but it takes time to find answers to the above and many more questions.
But whatever the price it demands, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animals are the source of human coronaviruses
Conversions and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of their hosts, including the coronavirus (CoV) and humanity, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown its reverse back to reveal how devastating and deadly an HCoV infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought CoVs back to the forefront of negotiation, and it surprised us by showing higher transmissibility and lower pathogenicity compared to her sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-borne disease and can help us understand the zoonotic source of HCoV.
Most of the HCoVs have emerged from bats where they are less infectious.
Some HCoVs have also been reported to be the intermediate Aadhar shelters.
The identification of animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating the exchange of CoV-residents in animals can also provide important insights into the coV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we give an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as their animal source and interrelated infections.
Importantly, we compare and compare different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome reconnection.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, the need for successful shelter change and the effects of the virus' evolution in the severity of the disease are also noted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the coronavirus family, consisting of a group of wrapped, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses sheltering the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes of RNA viruses were called ""CoVs"" due to crown-national organelles beneath the electron microscope."
Structurally, CoVs have an integral genome that belongs to the same organization.
About two-thirds of the GNOME has two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are processed to produce another 16 non-infrastructured proteins, which have been named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for constructive proteins, which include kelp (S), wrap (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four groups (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), most of which are HCoVs in the beta-CoV group and are divided into four groups (A, B, C and D).
Ethnic evidence has shown that rats and mice act as gene sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main basis for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently surpassed interspecies barriers and have emerged as some of the major human pathogens.
To date, seven human coVs (HCOVs) have been reported.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common flu and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute respiratory tract infections in more patients with a higher probability of exposure outside the lungs (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome, ARDS) and acute lower respiratory tract infections.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from nasal discharges in patients with common flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the idea was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak that the transmission of HCoVs was generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and the crude death rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East's Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak continued to plague the Arabian Peninsula and spread scattered throughout the rest of the world.
The 2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the effective agent of the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 infections as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world needs to be prepared for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoVs has an animal source from rats, mice, or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary source of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well-adapted and show a great genetic diversity but not pathogenic.
The COVID-19 pandemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The search for an HCoV-animal source provides a framework for understanding the reasons for the natural history, driving power, and the limitations of moving from species to species (species jumping).
It can guide or manage the search for the Aadhaar, intermediate and amplifier animal shelter(s) of SARS-CoV-2, along with important factors involved in preventing future spillovers.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal sources of HCoVs, inter-racial infections and pathogenesis.
In particular, we would like to highlight this general context and discuss that the guardian viruses of HCoVs are usually incurable among their natural hosts but are pathogenic after the new host has entered the body.
We also review the evolutionary trends of HCoV where the pathogenesis often decreases as the infectivity increases.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
CoVs have been known to animals since the late 1930s.
A variety of CoVs were collected in different infectious animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, before patients with common cold first collected the B814 of the HCoV-229E strain from the nasal discharge.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been detected.
A summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract in 1966 in patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently adapted to grow in the line of WI-38 lung cells.
HCoV-229E showed symptoms of common cold, including headaches, sneezing, feeling ill, and sore throat, and fever and cough in 10-20% of patients infected with HCoV.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from organ culture and later from the recurring growth of the virus in the brains of lactating rats.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to the symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomaticly isolated from the infection of other respiratory pathogens such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread globally and are mainly infectious in winter climates during the winter season.
Usually, the outbreak of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A human volunteer study found that healthy people with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients were found to have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
"SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first love-documented HCoV-caused epidemic in human history and was the causal representative of SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV."
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong, China.
The SARS pandemic has reported 8,096 cases across many countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could have an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the 10th day of the illness, show the final signs of viral load as well as increase about two ancillary cases.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, initially muscle aches, headaches, fever, unpleasant feeling and shortness of breath, coughing, and shortness of breath after colds are seen as delayed symptoms.
Lymphopania, deformed liver function tests and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Loss of alveolar alveolar diffused in SARS patients, proliferation of substrate cells, and growth of macrophages were also observed.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later stage.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, can be infectious in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine disorders that can be especially fatal in patients with immune system disorders.
The virus was first collected from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an index patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially prevalent in young children, the elderly and patients with respiratory illnesses whose immunity was low.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in coriza, eyesight, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described a collection of the same virus from nasal samples of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and most of them occur in summer, spring, and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma disease.
HCoV-HKU1 similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four group-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause high pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as rare cases of highly harmful subtypes of HCoV-NL63 that have recently been reported to have acute infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit and maintain themselves in humans, they also become less harmful or infectious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and respiration failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases have originated in the Middle East, cases have been reported from outside, including a second-degree spread in sometimes close contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, another second-stage outbreak occurred in South Korea, where 186 confirmed cases were found.
Characterized by progressive acute pneumonia, the diagnostic manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also had acute renal dysfunction, which is unique in terms of MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach ailments such as diarrhea and nausea.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 labs have confirmed cases with a fatality rate of more than 34.4%, resulting in MERS-CoV being one of the deadliest viruses for the human body.
From mid-December 2019 to late-December 2019, classes of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, as being linked to the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, with a fatality rate of 3.4%, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
Notably, Hubei's case fatality rate in China is 4.2%, on the other hand 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and acute respiratory distress can quickly progress to syndrome.
Although 82% of high nucleotide sequences are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to homology, they are grouped into different branches of the ethnic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as a symptomatic case and can play a role in its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs is of great interest.
First, the duration of the pathogen's release period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 comes between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs infected in public (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit features that are commonly seen during community-acquired HCoV infections with nonspecific, mild or even symptomatic presentations.
On the other hand, symptoms of SARS-CoV infection are also seen in a small part of the severe cases of COVID-19, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection group shows interesting characteristic patterns of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are at least as high as group-acceptable HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission rate of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans decreases after passage, as well as in SARS-CoV-2.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in mole samples.
At least in some circumstances, it remains to be clarified by future studies whether malignant cavity transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in cases such as SARS-CoV.
It is of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2, like community-acquired HCoVs, exhibit seasonal dependence.
Yet, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenesis and sustainable spread, will be influential in the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four groups of mild symptom-causing HCoVs have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it can also be true that people have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be survivors of the old HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who have developed serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs will have to replicate among humans in sufficient quantities in order to freeze adaptive mutations that fight the causes of shelter restrictions.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and the more people infected with it, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its infection in the human body by quarantine or other measures of infection control.
For many years, four group-acquired CoVs have been spreading to the human population, and causing common colds among patients with general immunity.
These viruses do not require any animal Aadhaar.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and cannot sustain infections in humans.
These need to be retained and expanded in the zoonotic bases and perhaps seek an opportunity to spread to the receptive human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifier wearers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least until now, it is highly transmissible just like the community-acquired HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than group-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoVs or MERS-CoVs.
It has to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and whether animals continue to spread among humans without any adhaar or intermediate animal feeders.
Before we discuss the animal source of HCoVs, we will benefit from discussing the definitions and characteristics of the hosts of the evolutionary, natural, adharma, intermediate and amplifier of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary fosterer of HCoV if it shelters the closely related predator by sharing higher homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The aneurysm usually adapts well to the body of this host and is non-infectious.
In the same way, an aadhaar shelter gives shelter to HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or just around people, it does not fit well with the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection, and can play an amplifier host to replicate the virus temporarily and then widen the level of human infection through it to the human body.
If HCoV cannot continue the infection in the intermediate host, the infection can be prevented.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also be adapted to the intermediate host and start long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the intermediate dresser becomes the wearer of the natural adhaar.
Epidemiological data revealed in the eventuality that the animal had a history of contact with the SARS-indicated event.
The subsequent seroprevalence findings indicated that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG was higher among animal traders than in the general public.
A raccoon dog was first identified in the markets of gonorrhea (Paguma larvata) and livestock to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that was almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the data that no further SARS cases were reported after all the odors were killed in the markets.
But it has been reported that wild or farm-faced palm civets without exposure to the live animal market were largely negative for SARS CoV, which indicates that masked palm odors will only act as intermediate amplifier shelters but not as a natural residue for SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of different types of animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as an intermediate amplifier of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these are considered to be unidirectional paediatrics of SARS-CoV.
The next discovery of the natural animal feeder of SARS-CoV has revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese Horseshoe Bat. The next discovery has revealed a closely related bat CoV, SARS-Sump.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have formed the basis for the new notion that bats provide shelter to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be collected as a living virus.
Human angiotensin convertor enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV.
It was shown to use bats, civets, and human ACE2 as receptors for entering the WIV1 cells obtained from bat mall samples.
Curiously, serums in patients with SARS who are recovering were able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which share 95% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high level of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a SARS-CoV instantaneous parental virus and that bats are not an immediate host of SARS-CoV.
Physiogenic analyses classify MERS-CoV into the same class as BAT CoV-HKU4 and BAT CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipotidyl peptides 4 (DPP4), to penetrate the virus.
RNA-dependent MERS-CoV's RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically close to replications of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be an immediate receptacle for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle East studies have found that one-knee camels are seroppositive to MERS-CoV specific mitigating antibodies, just like camels from the Middle East source in multiple African countries.
The organism MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was collected from the nose swab of a wrinkled camel, which further indicates that the camel acts as an actual base for MERS-CoV.
It's also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV usually have mild symptoms, but there have been plenty of virus shadings.
Notably, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory system, but also through the rectum-oral pathway, which is also the main way to spread the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before symptoms began, possibly from human to human infection or from an unknown animal species that shelters MERS-CoV from the infection pathway involved.
The bat CoV RaTG13 collected from rhinolophos affinis bats has 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequencing divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also very much in favor of determining parental relationships.
This means that bats may not be a direct adhering to SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the near future.
Perhaps, the animal shelterer between SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals that are sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with many of the earliest cases associated with COVID-19, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
A number of recent studies, based on metagenomic sequencing, have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as bonerui (Manis Javanika) may also carry the hereditary beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This is a replica of 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology SARS-CoV-2 of the Novel Benarui CoV genomes.
However, with about 90% uniformity in the level of nucleotide sequencing, they are equally involved with RaTG13.
They grouped into two sub-tribes of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in an ethnic tree, one of which shared a similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence identification with SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are further decreasing, although sequencing homology genome-wide is of a higher degree.
A previous study on sick bunnies also reported the detection of a continuous sequence of viruses from lung samples, which have been proven to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
Various assembly methods and manual presentations were adopted in this study to create a partial genome sequence with about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the most intermediate animal breeders of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct source of SARS-CoV-2, due to sequence segregation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is much lower than those related to SARS-CoV-2 and Benarooi SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been established.
While most sequencing homology between SARS-CoV-2 and RBD in Bonnaroo has been found, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the most genome-compliant sequencing homology.
It is highly hypothetical that the high similarity between beta-CoVs associated with RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated vascular evolution.
A counter-proposal favors a recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 among the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, the reconnection between beta-CoVs is widespread.
There is still no information about the direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylagenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were derived from bat CoVs, although the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rats.
It has been reported that HCoV-NL63 has demonstrated close ties to a bat called ARCoV.2 (Apalachean Ridge CoV) detected in three colored bats in North America.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV known as Hipposideros/Ghanakowm/19/2008, although comelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the animal source of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of CoV-infection events in the history of the species.
By 1890, when HCoV-OC43 had infected humans from domesticated animals, a respiratory disease was seen.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is alpha-alpha.
A number of evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in a shared ecological environment, bats may be in contact with humans but not with alpacas.
Instead, people have close contact with the alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are varied and non-infectious in alpha-CoV-like bats, while alpha-CoV causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-coV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas receive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, bats act as a gene pool of alpha-CoV-all HCoV-229E, but alpacas and one-knee camels can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of the spread of interspecies transmission from bats to bats and from a bat to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV from bats is known in early detection and is further strengthened by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interracial exchange of genetic fragments and interracial transmission.
Longevity, sparsely filled colonies, close social exchanges, and strong flying skills are the ideal conditions for bats to become 'virus spreaders'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has come into contact with a wrinkled camel a few decades ago.
It fits well with these camels that have evolved from an intermediate shelter to a stable and natural shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases and maintains a relatively low rate of arousal among these animals.
Its spread in humans is an accident and humans remain the latest host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV infection, the role of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 infection is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic among pangolins.
They may be the latest host for SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs similar to gonorrhea in the case of SARS-CoV.
The various possibilities of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from interspecies animals to humans may be included in future studies or may have to be canceled.
First, bats can be the host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share environmental niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, bunkers may be one of the intermediate amplifier shelters where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected with the virus by cutting and eating the meat of the victim.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are unprotected by SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domesticated and wild animals for antibodies has been confirmed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
In addition to a variety of animal shelters, the three main causes of the viral side are also important in helping CoVs overcome interracial barriers.
First of all, they have a relatively high conversion rate in the form of RNA.
"Compared to other single-sourced (stranded) RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered as ""moderate"" to ""high"" depending on the stage of the novel pose's CoV adaptation, and the average replacement rate is <0x7E>10-4 replacements per site per year."
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, which results in excessively high variability and vulnerability or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, this exoribonuclease of the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir and the suppression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are known to form CoV replicas.
Remdesivir is one of the most likely anti-SARS-CoV-2 components tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the conversion rate is often higher when CoVs can't adapt well to the wearer.
Compared to the SARS-CoV with a higher conversion rate, the conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, which is an indication of more easily adapting to humans.
Perhaps it has already adapted to another refugee close to the people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also applicable to MERS-CoV, which fits well with a curly camel.
In theory, the genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoV uses additional flexibility in genome mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the probability of evolution, including interconnection, which makes it more convenient for the emergence of CoVs when the situation becomes more favorable.
It is supported by a lot of unique encoded open reading frames and protein functions on the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> edges of the genome.
"Thirdly, CoVs change templates when replicating RNA through a random and often unique ""copy-likes"" process."
In the shelter that serves as a mixing pot, the strand switching often occurs during the CoV RNA replication.
High homogeneous full-length and subgenosome RNAs can reconnect to create new coVs.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal cov-types such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interaction between viruses relating to infection
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral exchange with the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Among these, the recombination of SARS-CoV was taken as an ideal example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between the collection of human and odorless SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be able to adapt quickly to the RBD mutation of S proteins, especially among different receptors.
RBD usually interacts with the cellular receptor in the S protein of a CoV and is strongly selected by the response of the host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD contains 318th to 510th amino acids in the S1 piece that bind to human ACE2 as well as its choreographers for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats, and raccoon dogs, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only the residues of 6 amino acids in humans and RBD have been found to be different from odorless viral isolates, and 4 of them are located in the customer-binding design to interact with the ACE2 customer.
SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T mutations, which can increase the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be serious for virus-related adaptation in humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are cellular receptors.
The 30% difference between the S1 unit of SARS-CoV-2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV indicates that the tendency of humans to bind to its S protein with ACE2 may vary.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher bonding trend than what is trending in human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine if any other co- recipient may be needed for the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Worryingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a separate part of S.
There are many other HCoV customers, such as aminopotidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated cialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be considered as a reason for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after they have been infected with the endogenous species from their animal host.
In addition to cellular receptors, the results of interracial transmission of HCoVs are also driven by factors of dependence and limitations on other hosts.
The division of these host proteins between humans and HCoV-like natural hosts such as bats, a wrinkled camel, and rats can hinder interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to take into account the reasons for sheltering reliance for a successful interspecies transmission and destroy the reasons for sheltering restrictions.
In this case, the molecular determinants are yet to be identified and described in this important case of virus-assistant exchanges.
Using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR, a neutral genome-wide screening of shelter dependence and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful.
The Rise of Novel HCoV: Return to Where It Began
The variety of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, the bat acts as a gene pool of coV-bombs HCoV-bombs.
Also, rapid mutation and genetic recombination drives the evolution of HCoV and serves as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition of new protein-coding genes or the loss of viral phenotypes has the potential to be fatally modified.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in adapting to humans because SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but they were found to encode the exposed ORF8 proteins.
The feature of removing a 29-nucleotide from SARS-CoV-bombs has been found in strains collected at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it seems to be an adaptive adaptation that encourages a change of shelter.
Also, there is a history of possible recombination of SARS-CoV with alpha- and gamma-CoV-groups, where a large number of small recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Rebalancing positions were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10 and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV went through a reconnection between different tribes, which occurred in the case of a knuckle camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of recombination of other HCoVs have been noted, where HCoVs recombinate with other animal coVs in genes that are not structural.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly as a result of the release of viruses from selective pressures such as the host immune system.
Examples of these effects are the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 HCoV-229E can be seen in related bat and camel viruses, alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide placed inside, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of the novel HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of the selection of their basewear.
When bats were infected with CoV they were symptomatic or they were only detected with mild symptoms, which indicates mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It has been found that bats adapt well to the emergence and physiologically with CoV-bombs.
For example, the defects in activation of the reaction in favor of inflammation in bats effectively reduce the pathology driven by CoVs.
In addition, repressive natural killer cell receptors NKG2/CD94 and the activity of the bat's natural killer cell has been suppressed due to low release levels of major histopotential complex I class molecules.
Moreover, both suppression of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) CoV produced from high metabolic activity of bats and affecting proofreading by exoribonucleases can do this, thus providing the necessary selection pressure to produce the strains of the virus when exposed to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also develop through recombination that leads to the acquisition of a new protein or protein character for host adaptation.
So, it is unlikely that three new HCoVs will emerge in the last two decades.
CoV-bombs cause mild symptoms in non-patients or their Aadhaar patrons such as bats and camels.
They grow vigorously without reacting to the strong resistance of the shelter.
The secret of why there are no symptomatic carriers and what causes serious human infections is contained in it.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of the immune response and the cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of symptomatic carriers, the resistance response has been distinguished from the CoV replica.
The same technique of disconnecting the immune response may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reactions are particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the application of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
With this argument, the inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasomes, including MCC950, can be effective in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common causes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV that exchanges 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, on the other hand, there is a bat-CoV that exchanges 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although odors and other animals found on the market have been reported to have sheltered viruses similar to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate shelters for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Separately similar to SARS-CoV-2, beta-CoVs have been found, indicating that beta-CoVs will act as one of the intermediate hosts or that beta-CoVs may contribute to the gene fragment in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have once again returned to the negotiating table.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the importance of animal sources and animal bases of HCoVs in human infection.
Extensive evidence has shown that there is a bat source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and they are transmitted to humans through intermediate shelters.
Since SARS-CoV infection is derived from exposure between humans and odors in the market, closing the wet market and killing odors there could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, pangolin should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal infection in view of the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin beta-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future investigations into what exactly and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through brothels and other mammals remain to be clarified.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has existed for a long time in a cushioned camel.
These camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local people in addition to being an important means of transportation.
They are spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in China's wild animal market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control systems.
If we are not able to eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may appear.
There are many types of CoVs in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, with animal potential, are very diverse.
These zoonotic CoVs have a lot of potential to expand and reconnect, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or fatal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places of China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the outbreak of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, there should be a plan for better preparedness and response.
Many viruses have been around for a long time.
They remain in their own natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that are in favor of spreading the virus, the chance of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware of being away from them.
For a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is required, which will prove to be effective in preventing human infections from animals and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases in humans is to stay away from the ecological niche of the natural habitat of the animal virus.
Several pieces of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2's parental virus to the bunrui, it is necessary to see under what circumstances the bats and the bunru can share the same environmental niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human infections, it should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, it is necessary to clarify how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether it's bats, pangolins, or any other mammals, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical genus viruses will be identified in its natural habitats in the future.
Continuous investigations in this case will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the criteria for "positive" and "confirmed" diagnosis of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team released a quick consultation guideline for the detection and treatment of the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection and this guideline provided us with experience and made good references to the fight against this pandemic worldwide.
However, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment techniques are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment on our directives and provided a new diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases," in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment instructions issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has been officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick consultation guideline and it was published online at Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has received a great response.
Remember, COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and experiences in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment techniques are also being constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostics and medical instructions issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have been published in a total of seven editions, each with significant changes to some content.
Now Zhou and his colleagues have made a comment about our guidance, suggesting a simple score-setting based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidance and also creates valuable references to the pandemic around the world.
We are appreciating their remarkable work and we thank them.
However, they will also have to update their work on the latest diagnostic and medical guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial VII edition) and recent research.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, a detailed analysis requires two clinical symptoms to be accompanied by one of the epidemiological historical features, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, then three clinical symptoms must be met.
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of the inhabitants of the city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or the history of travel thereto, or other communities where the symptoms have been reported in the last 14 days of the outbreak, such as those in the outbreak of COVID-19; (2) a history of exposure to other cases of SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases, such as those reported in the outbreak of COVID-19; (2) a history of exposure to other cases of SARS-CoV-2; (3) positive cases in the outbreaks in the affected areas of the outbreaks; (3)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging properties of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white blood cell counts at the stage of early onset show normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte counts.
For a confirmed case diagnosis based on a suspected case, there should be any pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the IRS-CoV-enhancing stage is positive in the IRS-enhancing real-time PCR test; (2) antigen sequencing of the virus and obtaining high homegrownness with the known novel coronavirus in the IRS-2SA-serum test; (3)
As we have seen, real-time PCR tests and blood samples have been included in the respiratory tract in the 2nd (18 January 2020) and 3rd (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathological detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continued work of the researchers to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for a quick diagnosis of respiratory tract samples with a blood sample, which increases the availability of different samples, and which helps to bring certain antibody positive results to certain standards.
Moreover, more evidence has been found, which reminds us to be wary of irregularly symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou and his colleagues should update the flow list, as they classify people with no clinical symptoms as "low-risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in subsequent clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that there will be more direct evidence and readers will call for their comments.
In order to diagnose "assumptions" and "confirmed cases," we recommend identifying them and following the most recent guidelines in our country.
Our team will be updated in a timely manner.
Bangladesh reported the highest number of new deaths due to COVID-19.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that the number of registered cases included 114 active cases and 33 recoveries who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two of the victims are over 60 years old, two are between 51 and 60 years old and one is between 41-50 years old.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
One of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait Friendship Hospital, a local news agency said.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will remain closed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods such as medical, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 was recorded between two people who returned to Italy from Bangladesh on March 8 and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million worldwide.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections has exceeded one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The important event took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed that it was one of the few remaining countries free from coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, in the preceding twenty-four hours at 10 Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were recorded, connecting at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted Johns Hopkins University as saying that more than 1,000 people in the United States have died from the coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
All over the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin has announced that payments will continue even if the Russians do not work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; 215 votes in favor, ten not voted and one vote against were passed.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last the whole day; the previous curfew was only effective from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
In Australia, shops have reduced the limit of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australia's retail chain Wolworths and Coles reduced the restrictions on buying toilet paper per transaction in all stores at the national level to two and one package respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also launched a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were posted as messages at checkouts and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Consumers are said to have been stockpiling fears of COVID-19 if people thought they had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths - also restricts the sale of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes follow the four-pack limit for previous transactions that Woolworths and Colls launched on March 4th and 5th, respectively.
"On March 8, Coles Media reported that a four-packet ban had been introduced in various places, but that ""many shops still sell everything within an hour of delivery"", calling the demand ""unprecedented"" and in a Facebook post on ALDI on Tuesday, they described it as ""unprecedented""."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's stores in Canberra were also allowed two packs last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the recurrence rate of supply, Woolworths orders additional stocks, where ALDI makes stocks available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase reserves, but local council restrictions during the time of delivery by truck make the issue difficult.
With suppliers trying to meet demand, he expects production costs to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after leaving the stock earlier, some stores may not be able to handle Wednesday's special sales.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert from Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill their reserves every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy material that leaves very little in its collection and when all is sold, huge shelves are left empty and the feeling of scarcity is reinforced.
"According to ABC News, ""Coles and Woolworths' opinion is that if he has a lot of stuff, and a lot of things like toilet rolls and sanitizers, and he has enough, then this fear is likely to be mitigated,"" said Russell Zimmerman."
Hu Gives A Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that their stock would be exhausted.
According to news.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures cleanex toilet tissue and solaris paper, insists that they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
A real estate site, Domain.com, reported that some property vendors were giving free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, some of which were due to be auctioned off on the long weekend of labor days.
This Thursday's edition of NT News, published daily in Darwin, offers an eight-page additive for cutting pieces and is used as a toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on March 3 said the stores were largely reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for other products is also very high, including masks, sanitizers, dry products, handwashing and flour.
In the same way, every Sunday evening outside Australia, two 12-roll packs of paper used for Andrews toilets in the online British supermarket, Okada, were restricted.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — as a pandemic.
"Although the term ""extremism"" does not refer to how dangerous certain cases are but to how widely any disease has spread, the World Health Organization noted the need for governments to take action:"
"""All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic."
"WHO Secretary-General Adanam Ghebreyesus said if states can identify, ""can test, treat, isolate, identify and coordinate""."
"""We are deeply concerned by both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity."""
"According to Dr. Tom Freaden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the global pandemic is ""unprecedented""."
"In a comment published on CNN in February, he said, ""Except for influenza, no respiratory virus has been continuously tracked since the emergence of the world."
"Gabriels also shares the same view, ""We have never seen a pandemic created by the coronavirus."""
"He continued, ""And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."""
The new status as a global pandemic follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in January.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""The mood is, the situation is going to get worse."""
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide was at least 126,000, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been detected in 210 countries and union territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 36,000 people have recovered.
China's case fatality rate is estimated at 4%, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and assistive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering your face during a seizure, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolating for people suspected to have been infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by shutting down travel controls, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk control and facilities.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruptions, sporting, religious, political and cultural events have been canceled, and shopping due to fear has led to increased supply shortages.
Schools and universities are either nationally or locally closed across 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of alienation and discrimination against Chinese, Eastern and Southeast Asian individuals and others from areas where the virus has been found significantly, depending on their race and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, the levels of air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) in China reported on 31 December 2019 about a cluster of pneumonia infected with unknown causes, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronavirus of bats, the bunruai coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person who was diagnosed with the symptoms, later on on 1 December 2019, was informed that he had fallen ill; and subsequently that the person had no visible connection with the wet market cluster.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases in December 2019.
An unofficial report from the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that finding the source on 17 November 2019 was perhaps the first case, which occurred in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had dropped so-called, but the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea had suddenly increased for the first time in China, and new cases outside China.
The number of cases may be reduced, especially for people with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, there have been relatively few cases among young people, most of them under the age of 19, and 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Valence, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before gaining immunity.
According to the official protocol, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and tested positive.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have formulated formal policies not to test people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China had not been detected and these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official count of infections.
The initial estimates for the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it was probably 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
In those who do not, the death interval from the onset of symptoms is 6 to 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of people in China who are over the age of 60 have died and 75% of them already had heart disease and various diseases including diabetes. Official figures for COVID-19 deaths usually indicate those who were infected with COVID as per the traditional rules.
The death toll as a result of COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - such as at home, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy shows that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic has increased 4-5 times the official COVID death rate.
"A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that ""we know [the reported death toll] is a lower estimate than the actual number"", a statement that was corroborated by reports that the U.S. is not a low-calculated source of information. This type of devaluation occurs most often in the first case of the global pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu in January."
The first death outside of mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside of Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories across all continents, except Antarctica. Several methods have been used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of populations such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of mortality and transmission shows the number of deaths being divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time frame.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death toll and case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the death toll and case ratio have dropped from 17.3% (those who have had symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (those who have had symptoms since 1st February 2020). Other preventive measures include the unreported case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from any disease (ifR).
These statistics are not limited at any time and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have tried to count these numbers for a specific population.
The Oxford University Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the mortality rate for this infection ranges from 0.1% to 0.39% overall.
The calculations on the top of this range are consistent with a statistical study of the effects of the first allopathic test of COVID-19 in Germany and the analysis of the test on CFR hypotheses.
The WHO has claimed that the pandemic can be controlled.
The upper limit and the final time frame of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
"As we go from untested, infectious outbreaks usually dominate, and then when the disease no longer has a host, it begins to degenerate,"" said Mackenzie Bonnie of Penn State University."
However, it is almost impossible to predict when this will happen.
"The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that if all countries could be brought together to follow the World Health Organization's advice to prevent the spread of the virus, ""it could end in June""."
"On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""possibly will continue to spread for a year or two."""
"According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, ""physical distancing and other measures need to be maintained until a vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more)""."
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's quite impossible that this coronavirus - since it gets infected so quickly - will disappear completely"" and that it can become ""a seasonal disease, coming back every year""."
The severity of the return will depend on the animal's immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and people infected may be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Relatively less common symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, muscle and intestinal tract pain, sore throat, headaches, body colds, vomiting, coughing, coughing, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO has stated that about one in six people who fall sick are seriously suffering from it.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, wakefulness, and blunt appearance or lip; it is advisable to seek medical help immediately if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can be caused by severe pneumonia, acute respiratory disorders, cardiovascular syndrome, sepsis,
Some of the infections may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have advised people who have come into contact with infected people to avoid the infection.
Chinese estimates of symptomatic proportions range from a few to 44%.
The range of the stage of general incubation (in the period during which infections and symptoms begin) ranges from one day to 14 days; five days on a regular basis. In the case of uncertainty, the fraction of people with COVID-19 who received the initial odor loss is 30% and the subsequent loss is 15%.
Some details are still being worked out on how the disease spreads.
It is believed that the disease is mainly spread during close contact and by small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact refers to being between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that water particles from an open cough can range from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
According to some, the virus can also be infected by small liquid droplets that can be formed when speaking, which remain in the air for a long time. Breathing disorders can also occur during exhalation, including when speaking, although this virus is not normally airborne.
The water particles can enter the mouth or nose of those close to them or they can enter the lungs by breathing.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to respiratory aerosols and result in airborne transmission.
It can also spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through malls, this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of oral infection from SARS-CoV-2 stools. The virus remains most infectious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can also be infectious before and after symptoms appear.
Many people have tested positive for these symptoms three days before they start, which suggests that it is possible to transmit the disease before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few cases of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have detected asymptomatic infections during contact detection investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person usually infects two to three people. The virus survives on the surface for several hours to several days.
In particular, the virus is found in plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steels for up to three days, in cardboard for one day and in copper for four hours.
It varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as other surfaces that have been touched by infected people do after touching them.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel and novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, this virus is killed by cell soap as it breaks down the virus’s protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a source of animal-borne diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically linked to the genus Betacoronavirus with the strains found in two bats in subgenus Serbecovirus (Line B).
In other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13), the total genome level is 96%.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found in the study that there is only one amino acid difference between the virus contained in Banarasi and the virus contained in the human body in certain parts of the genome sequence.
Compared to the entire genome to date, it has been found that there is a 92% genetic similarity between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the genome served as the host in the middle.
The infection can be diagnosed through the virus depending on the symptoms temporarily, but ultimately confirms the reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected larvae.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many of its features are incompatible with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19""."
The WHO has released a number of RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually seen in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed over a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used. Some laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for long-term use.
In the United States, serological tests made by Chelsea were allowed to use only authorized laboratories in emergencies.
Characteristics of taking photos in the radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of predisposed people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and the absence of Pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of photos from the test of confirmed cases.
In combination with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR has restricted the formation of an image without any confirmation and the detection of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared PCR to CT results and explained that, although the imaging of this infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive which suggests that it should be considered a device for screening in epidemic-hit areas.
Artificial intelligence has been created to create a birth organization that prepares virus features through radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall personal good hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with no washing hands, and sneezing or coughing in tissues, and throwing that tissue into a garbage container.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have advised or controlled against all non-essential movements from countries and territories affected by the outbreak.
The virus has spread to large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in public and some people in the public community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended to use evidence warnings, contact alerts and eye protection for healthcare providers who are in the care of someone who may be infected. It is very important for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and find out people who have come in contact to prevent further infection.
The administration's use of mobile phone location information for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations issued a statement urging such surveillance to be limited.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen experts have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to log in to other users' mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they come in contact with a COVID-19 positive person. There are a number of misconceptions surrounding how to prevent the infection, such as washing the nose and gargleing with a mouthwash.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are working to create one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are apparently dirty; before meals; before coughing, or sneezing.
Since the virus can be killed with domestic soap outside the human body, it can burst the protective bubble of the virus.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available, at least 60% alcohol-containing sanitizers can be used instead.
People are advised not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be contaminated with a few solvents (within a minute of contact with the disinfectant in the case of stainless steel surfaces), which include 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% potassium
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are relatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a place such as an office or daycare, the ATM machine used by offices, bathrooms, common places, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and sick people should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their mouth and nose elbows during coughing or sneezing, or cover them with tissue paper, and immediately drop the tissue properly.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are at risk of infection. Wearing a mask can control the amount of waterborne particles emitted when talking, sneezing or coughing and the extent of spread.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
"According to virologist Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds, ""Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."""
The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also admit that wearing a mask can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, CDC recommends wearing face non-medical masks made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy members of the public, especially when approaching other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
People in Hong Kong are advised to wear a surgical mask while travelling in public transport or in public places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash their face daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to wear a mask or to cover your nose and mouth when you go out.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask while traveling to populated places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has issued an order requiring everyone to wear a face mask when entering the grocery store.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear face masks whenever they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing about a million masks per day since mid-March, requires passengers to wear face masks on trains and interstate buses for travel on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask whenever you go out, and for those who can't afford to buy face masks, they have recommended home-made face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes controlling the spread of infection by slowing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include: being quarantined; limiting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shop-markets.
Individuals can apply methods of social distancing from home, limiting travel, avoiding populated areas, greeting without touching, and maintaining physical distance from each other.
Many governments are now making it mandatory or advising to maintain social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak of the disease.
According to U.S. government authorities and health institutions, the maximum size of gatherings quickly fell from 250 people (if not known to have spread COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people and subsequently 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and people with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, high blood pressure, and other underlying medical conditions, such as the disorders associated with the disease, have been identified by the association of the ""continuing linkage"" between the disease and the prevention of the disease, and the CHODC has been exposed to an increased risk of serious illnesses and complications at home, and in the outbreak areas in society."
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has impacted in such a way that instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others in alternative ways, it has led to total social isolation.
This included advice to have sex only with someone who lives with you, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who have been infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments mandate or advise self-quarantine of all residents living in the affected areas.
The strictest guidelines for self-quarantining have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have come into contact with any person with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread infection have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are prevention and suppression.
Prevention measures are in the early stages of the outbreak, and aim to initiate and vaccinate other measures of infection control, in addition to finding and isolating infected people to stop the spread of the disease in the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease cannot be sustained in any other way, the efforts go to the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken to slow down the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system and society.
At the same time, both containment and mitigation may have to adopt a mixed criteria.
In repression, there is a need to take more extreme measures to reduce the number of primary reproductions to less than 1 to reverse the epidemic cycle. The maximum limit of the epidemic is part of the prevention of an infectious disease, which is known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.
It reduces the risk of health services and provides more time for vaccinations and treatments to be improved.
Other ways in which the outbreak can be controlled include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantining; measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as stricter restrictions on travel, such as school closures and cancellation of public gatherings; other ways such as stricter measures to recognize and participate in public gatherings; also environmental measures, such as environmental measures.
Other countries have also adopted a number of standards aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea launched mass tests and quarantines locally, and issued warnings on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected individuals who quarantined themselves and imposed a large amount of fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and increased the fines for medical fraud. Efforts by Great Britain and the United States have shown that mitigation (slowed but not prevented) and suppression (increased adversely) pose a major challenge.
While the highest reduction policies can reduce healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, health systems are still in turmoil as a result of hundreds of millions of deaths.
Suppression may be the preferred way, but as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), it needs to be maintained, since otherwise the virus infection will return quickly if the measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic lead to social and economic harm.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop, including testing of existing drugs.
Over-the-counter fluoride medications can relieve symptoms by consuming, drinking fluids, and taking rest.
Depending on how severe the disease is, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids (through the veins) and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can lead to even worse results.
Multiple compounds approved for the treatment of other viral diseases in the past are being researched for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also stated that some "common and home remedies" help alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
Acquiring increased capacity and health centers for COVID-19 patients has been described by the WHO as a preventive measure primarily to prevent the outbreak of the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary medical supplies centers to remove sources at multiple levels and which include increasing the applicability to COVID-19 testing, increasing the number of intensive surveillance by isolating and isolationing COVID-19 positive patients and training staff, and the number of available ventilations and beds, etc.
There are various theories as to where the first case (so-called Patient Zero) might have arisen.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was found on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei was gradually increasing.
Most of these were related to the Huanan marine food wholesale market, where living animals were also sold, and according to one theory the virus came from one of such animals; or, in other words, it has an animal source. On December 26, a pneumonia cluster of unknown causes was observed, and Dr. Zhang Xiaan (Zhang Jixian) dated December 27, in Hubei Provincial Hospital.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were taunted by police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, I Feng, was slapped by his high-ranking staff for exposing the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.
Several cases of unknown pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan in early January, which is under investigation. At the initial stage of the outbreak, the number of cases has doubled every seven and a half days.
The virus spread to other parts of China in early and mid-2020, with Chinese New Year migrations and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail junction.
On January 20, China stated that about 140 new cases were found in a single day, two of which were from Beijing and one from Shenzhen.
Further government data shows that as of January 20, 2020, out of 6174 people already had symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has seen the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least one case was reported in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and controlled borders.
The national response includes some repressive measures such as isolation of everyone (known as home quarantine or shelter order or lockdown) and curfew. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million South Africans and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some kind of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was found in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; but according to an uncertain news, the first case was found on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jiejian noticed a cluster of pneumonia on December 26 for unknown reasons, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of the patient's samples on December 27, 2019, indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
It was reported to the WHO on the same day.
"After these notifications were published, police were warning for ""spreading rumours"" about the outbreak of Wuhan's doctors."
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign that later described the Chinese Communist Party's general secretary Xi Jinping as a ""people's war"" to contain the spread of the virus."
"A Cordon Sanitary was declared on January 23 by stopping travel to and from Wuhan, described as ""the largest quarantine in human history"", which was expanded to 15 cities in Hubei and affected a total of 57 million people."
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year (January 25) has been cancelled in many places.
Officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital i.e. Huishanshan Hospital which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built to take care of additional patients after Leishanshan Hospital.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China turned 14 other centers in Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government took measures for tourists to take additional steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including health-related announcements and spring festival holidays.
Schools and universities across the country have also been closed.
Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken various measures, especially in the case of schools and universities.
Work has been carried out in remote areas of China.
Hubei has been placed in control of travel both inside and outside the city.
Public transport systems across China have been changed, and museums have been temporarily closed.
"Control on public movements was applied in many cities and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some sort of out-of-the-way restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being ""imported"" from other countries."
For example, Beijing has made it mandatory for all international travellers entering the city to quarantine for 14 days. Only one case has been reported domestically in mainland China five days ago on March 23. It is found in a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said the spread of internally transmitted cases was largely blocked and the outbreak was controlled in China.
Two months after the lockdown was imposed, control over travel to Hubei was eased on the same day except Wuhan. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry permits for people holding visas or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, and no specific details were given as to when the policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa to the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese administration encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and provided financial stimulus packages for companies. The State Council announced a one-day mourning that began at 10:00 am on April 4 with a three-minute silence across the country, which also coincided with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay homage online while maintaining physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
As of January 20, 2020, it has been confirmed that COVID-19 has spread from China to South Korea.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, primarily responsible for the new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Jewish Shincheonji Church.
Visitors to the Shinkansen church who had come from Wuhan to worship in Daegu were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
On February 22, the church reported 1,261 of the 9,336 followers, or about 13%, symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alerts on February 23, 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected and changed for that reason. South Korea launched a program to test people for the virus and isolate infected people and find and quarantine those they came in contact with, which is considered the world's largest and best-organized program.
Screening methods include reporting symptoms of new international arrivals by mobile apps, driving tests for the virus, which are available the next day, and the ability to test 20,000 people per day needs to be increased.
The program in South Korea has been considered a successful program to prevent the outbreak, despite not fully quarantined cities. South Korean society was first polarized in response to the crisis by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have either signed the petition claiming that the outbreak was officially abused and called for Moon's impeachment or praised his response.
On March 23, South Korea reported the lowest number of single-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks starting April 1.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for testing for the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19, where two people died the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the affected areas in Prokop, and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict travel between different cities were announced in March, although heavy movements continued between cities as Percy stood in front of the New Year Nowruz.
Shia religious places at Com were open until March 16, 2020. Iran became the epicenter of the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the midst of claims that the outbreak levels were suppressed in Iran, more than ten countries found Iran as their source of infection by February 28, indicating that the outbreak levels were much higher than the 388 infections reported by the Iranian government as of that date.
On March 3, 23 of the 290 members of Iran's parliament tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, the human rights watchdog called for the unconditional release of Iranian jail officials who have been detained for peaceful dissent and the provisional release of all eligible prisoners.
It is said that in closed institutions such as prisons, there is a greater risk of the virus spreading, which also lacks appropriate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials have died of the disease as of March 17.
On March 23, Iran reported 50 new cases per hour and a new death every 10 minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of infections reported in Iran could be five times higher.
The U.S. sanctions on Iran may be detrimental to the country's financial capacity to deal with the infectious outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, including Iran, has called for lifting economic sanctions for those countries that have been most affected by the pandemic.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Cases have begun to rise even more sharply, prompting the Italian government to shut down all flights coming from China and declare a state of emergency in the country.
A bunch of unorganized COVID-19 cases were found after 16 confirmed cases were reported in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet issued a new law regarding this outbreak, where, in northern Italy, more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities were isolated from each other.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti said, "The pandemic has shown that entry and exit routes will not be allowed in all places."
"Work has already been disrupted in those areas and sporting events have been suspended. ""On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities at the national level as Italy's death toll reached 100."
Although all major sporting events, including football matches in the Serie A, are scheduled to be held with restrictions until April, on March 9, all sports were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies.

As of April 5, Italy has reported 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 people have recovered, of which these cases are the highest in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report suggests that the combination of Italy's elderly population and the inability to test for the virus to date may be leading to higher mortality.
At first, the UK had the most relaxed response to the virus among the affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British administration had not imposed any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received a lot of criticism for not feeling the magnitude and importance of the disease on people. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all unnecessary travel, social gatherings were prohibited, and he advised everyone to work from home wherever possible, and ordered bars, restaurants and theatres to be avoided.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay up to <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month for 80% of workers to prevent unemployment during this crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced measures to maintain strict social distancing, ban gatherings of more than two people, and restrict travel and outdoor activities only to what is considered extremely necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these controls were enforceable by the police, by issuing fines and removing gatherings.
"While most businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages, were ordered to close, only businesses considered ""essentials"" were an exception."

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, the United States has been testing at a very slow pace, which has led to the actual amount of infections being smoked during the outbreak.
The defective test kits produced by the state government in February and the private test kits (education centers, companies and hospitals) were not approved by the state government until the end of February, and the human-regulated qualifications (since a doctor's order was required) to qualify for a test by the first half of March were hampered.

"On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Goden Galli remarked that ""the WHO certainly did not recommend this"", and that it was ""a very important indication of the commitment of the global outbreak of PHEC in 2009, the first since the outbreak of PHEC, which was declared as the global outbreak of PHEC", and called it ""unprecedented in the history of John's and confirmed cases in other countries""."
"The WHO Director-General said that PHEIC's cause was ""the risk of global spread is higher in low and middle-income countries where there is no better medical care""."
"Responding to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that ""there is no reason for such initiatives that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and business"" and also that ""WHO does not recommend restricting business and activities."""
On February 5, the WHO asked the international community for $675 million in strategic preparations for low-income countries, and referred to providing emergency assistance to countries "who have been exposed to the virus in the region, even if it is inactivated."
"Tedros also declared that ""we are as strong as the weakest formula"" and urged the international community to ""invest today or pay more later""."
"On the same day, Tedros reported that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""was willing to give power to all UN systems in response""."

A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for their efforts to isolate people in the central China region, which clearly showed signs of dissatisfaction with political organizations focusing on the outbreak of the disease in these regions.
Some critics believe the move was to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the public's anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, whose theory of conspiracy on COVID-19 originates in the United States or Italy, denied a previous confession about the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan.
"Donald Trump's administration has described the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"", saying China's ""censorship has overcharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which some critics in response have criticized as racism and ""an attempt to mislead from its administration's failure to prevent the disease""."
"The Daily Beast received a speech about the performance of the U.S. government that outlined a communication strategy with existing sources in the National Security Council, where the strategy was cited as ""everything related to China""."
"We are told to try to spread this message in any possible way, including through press conferences and television appearances. ""Outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to virus-hit countries are part of the campaign for global influence."
"Joseph Borrell, head of the European Union's foreign policy, warned that there was a ""struggle for storytelling and a struggle for influence through a ""policy of liberality""."
"China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner,"" Borrell added."
China has repeatedly urged the United States to stop its donations to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, when it was reported that it was sending aid to the next two countries.

"This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."""
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian army to send military medicine, special disinfectant cars and other medical equipment to Italy.
"Anonymous in Italy's La Stampa newspaper quoted ""high-level political sources"" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was ""insignificant or scarcely usable for Italy""."
"The source blamed Russia for a campaign to please Russia ""geographically, politically and diplomatically""."
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane to the United States with medical supplies.
"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""When it comes to helping U.S. colleagues, [Putin] thinks that when U.S. medical equipment manufacturers get some momentum, they'll be able to pay back as well."""
"The NATO ""Defender 2020"" military practice planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, which is NATO's largest since the end of the Cold War, will be held at reduced levels."
"The General Secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, who is currently a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of Defender 2020, has also been critical of the current regime's handling of the virus, saying: ""In the current public health crisis, it will not only endanger the lives of the citizens of the United States and many other European countries, but also the lives of the participating countries."
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, where he said that the fight against the outbreak is becoming more difficult as the United States continues to impose sanctions against Iran, with its country having little access to the international market. The outbreak has led to calls for universal health care, universal child care, and salaried families like other sub-Saharan countries in the United States.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated during the global pandemic.
"After Japan announced that any South Koreans would be placed in quarantine at the government's designated place for two weeks, South Korea criticised Japan's ""obvious and passive quarantine efforts""."
South Korean society was initially on two opposite poles over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon to be sacked by the government, claiming that the outbreak was wrongly handled by the government, while others praised his response and signed petitions. The global pandemic has given many countries the opportunity to enact emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this may allow the government to reinforce their assertion of power over power.
In Hungary, its parliament issued a decree to Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely, to postpone Parliament or to run the election process, and to punish dignitaries who are spreading misinformation about how the disease is transmitted and how the government is dealing with the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for shortage of supplies, increased global use of equipment needed to fight the pandemic, creating panic and disrupting the operation of factories and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to rising demand for buyers and disruption of suppliers.
Shopping was also seen in several areas due to panic, which led to more people buying essential groceries such as food items, toilet paper and bottled water, which led to a shortage of groceries.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in sending electrical products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
The demand has increased by 20 times the normal price and delayed the delivery of medical supplies by six months.
It created a global shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO warned that it would put health workers at risk.
The pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for retailers to sell their products in China.
The activity resulted in the inadequacy of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high number of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan, ensuring an excessive demand for food items, both areas have been left free from severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against storing essential goods and illegal trade have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that were projected in North America, not just Europe.
Although there has been no significant decline in agricultural output in northern Italy, industry representatives say prices may rise.
When Chinese government officials gave up pork stocks to provide adequate nutrition to the people, even in Wuhan, they were initially faced with empty food shelves.
Italy has a similar national law that asks food producers to store food for such an emergency.
Damage to the global economy has also been felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard by the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5% in the first two months of 2020.
As China's mainland plays a key role in the economy and production, the outbreak of the virus threatens to create a major volatile situation for the world economy.
At the forefront of the Economist Intelligence Unit, Agatha Demarais has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture is revealed above the possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that economic disasters caused by the pandemic could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the world's supply chain has suffered more than $300 billion in losses that could last for up to two years.
"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have ""shut down"" after oil prices fell sharply due to low demand from China."
On February 24, the global stock market collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, multiple U.S. stocks, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest fall since 2008, with Dow wearing 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indexes were up more than 10% at the end of the week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The stock market fell again due to fears of the coronavirus. The biggest decline could be seen on March 16.
Many consider the possibility of an economic downturn.
Economist Muhammad El-Erian praised the central bank and the state's timely emergency measures.
Central banks are dealing with the pace at which the financial crisis of 2008 moved faster than it did.
Tourism is one of the most affected departments due to the government's ban on all public places, including tourist attractions, and any travel around the world.
As a result, multiple airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, canceled flights for relatively low demand, as the British regional airline Flybe crashed.
The impact of climate change on the maritime industry has never been seen before.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The main season of travel to China, called Chunun, began during the Chinese New Year holiday, at which time the epidemic began in China.
Many events where large gatherings can take place, such as the annual New Year celebrations, have been closed by the national and regional governments. Private companies have also closed their own shops and have closed several tourist attractions such as Hong Kong’s Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year festivals and tourist gatherings, including the banned city and traditional temple fairs in Beijing, have been closed to prevent public gatherings.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended New Year's holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response levels to a maximum and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and cancelling New Year’s celebrations. The global retail sales sector has been affected by a decrease in opening hours or temporary closures.
Shop visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have seen a 50-60% decline.
As a result, the number of buyers in shopping centers fell 33–43% in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall managers imposed additional measures, such as increasing health systems, installing thermal scanners to check temperatures of buyers, and canceling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the slowdown caused by the global pandemic could have led to a further 14 to 22 million more people in extreme poverty than it would have been if the global pandemic had not occurred in Latin America.
In the final stages of the pandemic in Wuhan in January and February 2020, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have either been rendered helpless at home in inland areas or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the calculations made by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could cause 47 million people in the United States to lose jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has resulted in millions of Indian migrant workers (about 90,000 of whom have lost their jobs per day) being unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French employees applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for universal credit projects. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their employees to government-subsidized short-term work plans known as Kurtzerbait.
The German Short-Term Work Compensation Scheme has also been adopted by France and Britain.
Performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, which has resulted in global damage to the activities of organizations as well as individuals - both employed and individualized.
Institutions in the arts and culture sectors sought to maintain their (often officially funded) missions to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, to maintain the safety of their staff and people, and to cooperate with artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters and other cultural institutions around the world and at various levels have been closed indefinitely by cancelling or delaying their exhibitions, events, and performances.
In response, intense efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the surge in religious services, major events in sports and other social events such as concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome during the last week of the Christian Lent season.
Many dioceses have advised older Christians to stay at home instead of coming on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming, or television, while others are offering prayers rather than getting out of the car.
With the closure of its churches and chapels by Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome and the emptying of the Christian pilgrimage to St. Peter's Square, other religious congregations have also canceled services and restricted public gatherings at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and later religious places were closed, and Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as residents of the country to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic is the world's biggest sporting disaster since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have either been cancelled or postponed.
"This outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event ""will not happen after the summer of 2021, though rescheduled at any date after 2020""."
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups on gambling sites show that many gamblers have gone online. Various music groups have also been affected by the entertainment industry for suspending or canceling waterslide tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"" so that artists can perform, distribute and promote their work."
Online, the meme of the internet given the theme of the countless coronavirus has spread, which is ridiculous and takes the spotlight away from this uncertain time.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in premonition, unwarranted fears of foreigners and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people in hotspot areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Reports of cases received since February have documented racist attitudes against groups of Chinese people around the world, claiming that they are eligible for the virus or what is being done to them as a fair retaliation.
In some African countries, anti-China sentiment has also increased.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei said they had been discriminated based on regional etymology.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and support for the people in the virus-hit region.
The new hotspots could be the first in Europe to experience the horrors of the COVID-19 outbreak, with people from Italy experiencing doubts and exaggerations. Citizens from countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions/applications to lobby for a ban on Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseJapaneseAssabenna became very popular.
Attacks on Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have been on the rise.
"US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a ""Chinese virus"", as critics consider the term to be racist and anti-Chinese."
Protesters from Ukraine attacked Ukrainian residents and foreign-born buses in Nabi Sanjahari from Wuhan.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in major cities in India have been reported to have been harassed related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and ""that is why God has taken revenge against them."""
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata has strongly criticized the comments in Kolkata and called them "misleading." Genophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have been on the rise during this pandemic, where foreigners have been described as "foreign waste" and identified as "extraction."
There are other newspapers, including Paywall, which have removed them from their partial or full coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have produced science-related works that are available in open access.
Some scientists are inclined to publish their results quickly on some innovative servers, such as BioRX.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods that detect the presence of the virus and detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and is only designed to detect RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (Serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including people who were too negligent to report symptoms or who were symptomless.
The results of these tests can determine an accurate mortality rate of the disease and group immunity among the people.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had credible information on the outbreak of the virus in their populations.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of their population, and there is a huge difference in how many tests have been conducted across different countries.
This difference will likely significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
In addition to nasopharyngeal swabs or spout samples, respiratory samples obtained through various methods can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually seen in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a sore throat is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat, but the number in the lungs can continue to increase.
In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material may be taken from the deep of the respiratory tract by the suction catheter, or the material emitted with a cough (put) may be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at the Charité in Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test between 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical stage PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It explores the common ""E"" gene in all beta-coronaviruses and the characteristic RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to deliver coronavirus-2019 through the National Medical Products Administration of China, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit for prevention and control of the disease in the United States."
Unresolved results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests of older versions of the test kits and one of the barriers to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US business labs began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests on the basis of RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics also made the nationwide COVID-19 test available on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced; samples must be collected and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
The test for COVID-19 in Russia was prepared and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, reports were received that the Mayo Clinic prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in excess of 3.5 hours, thus allowing a 24-hour test to be performed at a time of around 4 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization to Abbott Laboratories (EUA) for an experiment on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar approvals to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for a test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved an experiment that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, this method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to deliver 50,000 tests per day. A test uses a monoclonal antibody, which is precisely bound up with the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus being prepared, and just like a rapid influenza test, it can give results within 15 to 20 minutes.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that ""the importance of breast radiography in the early stages is very low in diagnosis, but the data from CT [computed tomography] may even be present before the onset of symptoms."""
Features of CT include two-sided, multilobar ground-glass opacity, including a marginal, asymmetric and backward distribution.
With the emergence of the disease, subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation appeared.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan, the current epidemiological source, suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many features of taking photos of it coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used for COVID-19 screening tests or as a first-line test for diagnosis""."
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infections in humans from 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine the immunity and to monitor the public. Evaluations can be carried out by Central Laboratories (CLT) and Point-of-Care Testing, PoCT.
Many essential laboratories will be able to perform high-performance automated systems in these asses, but the availability of them will depend on the rate of production for each system.
A single sample of marginal blood for CLT is commonly used, although sequential samples may also be used to follow the immune response.
In general, a single sample of blood is taken by piercing the skin for POCT.
An accumulation step is not required before testing like the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 entities that had provided the agency with the notification as required and now they are therefore able to deliver their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved under an emergency use authorization by the FDA. In late March 2020 Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The capacity of the test is several hundred samples in a few hours, and therefore much faster than the traditional PCR assessment of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK found that any antibody test kits they purchased were not good enough for use.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient"", he will spit in it, send it back and get the test results a little later." The British NHS has announced that they are launching a scheme on a test basis to test the suspects for COVID-19 if they need to be tested at home.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea to conduct the fastest, most comprehensive test of any country. The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that they have the ability to conduct around 12,000 tests per day in a moving setting and 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is performed on the orders of a doctor, the health insurance costs are borne.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive-in tests were offered in many major cities.
The total number of tests conducted in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that a total of 483,295 samples were tested as of 12/2020 calendar week up to 12/2020 and included a total of 3,491 samples in a sample of 10,000 samples per month, including a sample of 12,000 samples per month, which was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2."
The oversight of construction by BGI founder Wang Jian and the modeling of it to be completed within 5 days showed that if the testing capacity had not been increased in time, Hubei's cases would have been 47% higher and the cost associated with tackling quarantine would have doubled.
Huo-Yan Labs quickly followed Wuhan Laboratory in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020 the testing capacity was a total of 50,000 per day. Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Essays have been released that can test a maximum of 1122 patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
In March, the shortage of reagents and insufficient amounts became a limitation for mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This is why some researchers explored the sample preparation protocol where the samples were heated for 5 minutes at 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31 it was announced that the UAE is now testing more people for the coronavirus than other countries and is on the way to increasing the test levels to reach the majority of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-through capacity and a population-scale laboratory purchase from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab in the world to operate outside of China.
Various methods of testing were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The German system of production of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce their own kits was adopted by the World Health Organization.
The German system was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control (US Centers for Disease Control) was not available until 28 January, which delayed the tests available in the US. There was a problem between China and the United States with the reliability of the test kits being incapacitated early in the outbreak of the disease, and what these countries and Australia recommended to meet the demand and the testing by health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that excessive testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
Over the years, the South Korean administration has developed the ability to conduct experiments primarily in private sector labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to the widespread transmission of the virus led to the creation of hundreds of millions of test pending work in private US labs, and the supply of swabs and chemical catalysts is under pressure.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
"There was ""error"" in the test kits produced by the CDC in the United States; then the administration removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were wrong."
The company explained that the wrong result could be a result of not collecting samples or failing to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said they would withdraw the wrong results given the kits, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the wrong results of the test kits that were purchased from China. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> proposed to throw them into the Danube River. Turkish Health Ministry's Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had ""high-rate errors"" and they ""did not use them"". The UK announced that it had purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but first in April 2020.
Quarantine of those who were tested and then tested positive and finding those who had contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people were found to be positive.
In Italy, the first death toll from COVID-19, researchers working in the Italian city of Voe conducted a two-stage test on the entire population of about 3,400 people over a span of ten days.
Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all those who were identified were placed in quarantine.
Controlling traffic in the community has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive detection, inbound travel control, testing and quarantine, but without any extreme controls such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after a holiday break on March 23.
Many other countries have also controlled the global pandemic through aggressive searches, inbound travel controls, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested higher than the number of deaths had a much lower mortality rate, as these countries were also likely able to detect patients with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 should send the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
"The ""percentage of tests positive"" column in the following chart is influenced by the test policy of that country."
In a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the positivity rate will be higher than in a country where everything else is the same, whether the symptoms are visible or not, all citizens are tested.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of cleaning a person's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain ""important moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the mucous membranes."
People can also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash hands before touching eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments of the day when hand washing with soap are important: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's lower back or changing the nappy, before feeding the baby, before and after eating and before and after preparing food or handing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Handwashing can be done with ash if water and soap are not available. The World Health Organization recommends handwashing:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who has used the toilet.
After your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animal feed, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to healthy habits related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep hands clean from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause the disease) and chemicals that may cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who care or work in the medical field, but it is also an important method for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate during childbirth at home.
A 2013 study found that the improved habits of hand washing can lead to shorter improvements in length growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, the death rate of children with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate of this disease by about 50%.
The measures taken to encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to clean water supply in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap has been linked to a 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence. Handwashing with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) is performed as an automated practice in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five. It takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the leading causes of approximately 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, any change in the firm practice of washing hands with soap before and after eating can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reduce the mortality of diarrhoea by about half, and reduce the death from acute respiratory infection by one-quarter.
Handwashing is integrated with other sanitation systems as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing protects against infectious skin disease (impetigo) that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a skin rash known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Very frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five most important times of the day when washing hands with soap are: after using the bathroom (urination, exfoliation), after cleaning the baby's lower back or changing the nappy, before feeding, before eating and before preparing food or before/after handing over to raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent infection of the disease include before and after cutting or wound treatment; after sneezing, coughing, or nasal sneezing; after touching the animal waste or moving the animal; and after touching the rubbish.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is very low.
A survey of 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households are accustomed to hand washing with soap. A 2014 survey found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing in 97 percent of developed countries; the average rate of hand washing in the United States is around 77 percent of children in the developed countries; and the lowest rate of 23 percent in China is determined to do hand washing at a time of crisis. There are now quite a few habits to increase the habit of hand washing with soap in the existing.
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of taking adequate measures to promote children's health and education."
The main purpose of this program is to trim twice a year, as well as wash hands with soap and fluoride and brush your teeth every day.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water increases the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the resistance of the solution and increase the solubility.
Just water is ineffective skin cleanser (skin cleanser) because fats and proteins, which are the components of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is done with a limited amount of water.
Due to its reusable nature, the soap can retain the bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that focused on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer was less likely because the bacteria were washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that ""it is recommended to apply liquid soap that can be controlled without the use of hands""."
There has been a lot of public awareness about antibacterial soaps.
To date, no evidence of antiseptic or disinfectant use has been found for nature's antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which has the ability to resist excessive amounts of organics.
So, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protecting ingredients, the sophisticated preparations include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid) as a pH regulator. Removal of acrylic acids such as acetic acid, acetic acid, and lactic acid.
Hot water is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
But hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water to remove the natural oils that hold the soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microbial weight in the hands.
A non-water-based hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic that is a non-water-based hand-cleaning material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol rubber hand cleaning components (also known as alcohol-based rubber, antiseptic hand rubber, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most of the isopropyl is based on alcohol or ethanol prepared in combination with solids such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) or humectants such as liquids or glycerin in the foam to reduce the ease of use and the effect of alcohol drying.
Adding mixed hydrogen-peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer contains a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol which is efficient in killing germs.
Alcohol RAB sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rab sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (equivalent to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application in the hand, and kills 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria after 1 minute of application in the hand. Hand sanitizers are the most effective against bacteria and are relatively less effective against a few viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. They are almost completely ineffective against viruses of the type Norovirus (or Norwalk). You need to use enough hand antiseptics or alcohol rubbers to squeeze your hands well or to put on the front.
The liquid, foam or gel is frosted on the front and back of both hands and the middle of the fingers and the end of the fingers for about 30 seconds until it is dry.
Fingertips should also be washed very well by rubbing them with two hand palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands well with hand sanitizer, especially if you see dirt in your hands.
The increasing use of these ingredients depends on the simplicity of their use and the rapid dismantling of microscopic organisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing if soap and water are not available.
If the formula does not contain emulsifiers and/or skin moisturizers, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
In medical tests, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softening ingredients caused significantly less sensation and dryness to the skin than soaps or disinfectant detergents.
Hypersensitivity to allergic contacts, dental disorders or additives present in alcohol or alcohol is rarely found in alcohol hand rubs.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, the lower tendency to initiate painful touching dermatitis became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, the waterless material does not clean the organic material of the hand, but only sterilizes the hand.
Since the pathogen remains in the hands, effective hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends more on the ingredients and preparations, and in the past has worked significantly less than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Most recently, benzylconium chloride user preparations have been shown to maintain stable and enlarged antimicrobial activity after application, which is not like alcohol, which has been shown to decrease effectiveness after repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions.
In a low-income society, many people do not have the means to spend money on soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil can be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it produces an alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap.
The correct hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent infection include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Water is recommended because the permanent basin can be contaminated, but the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Raise the soap foam in the hand with enough soap to rub it on the back of the hand, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when using soap instead of just water.
Hold for at least 20 seconds.
There is friction during scrubbing which removes germs from the skin and more germs are removed when it is rubs for a long time.
Wash well with water.
Washing hands in the sink can be contaminated again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily re-contaminated. The places that are most missing are the space between the fingers, the wrists, the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can protect microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended so that the hands do not dry; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of spreading the infection.
"In developing countries where tap tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost alternatives can be made to facilitate hand washing, for example, pouring water from a hanging zirkane or a well with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In limited water supply conditions (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are other water-saving options such as ""TP-tape"" and ""low-costing""."
Tippi-Tap is a simple technology in which a jaggery hanging by rope and a foot-driven lever and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hand.
Hands drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective type of drying in public washrooms.
An increasing amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers seen in many washrooms.
The paper towel industry was developed by the European Tissue Symposium in 2008 to compare hygiene levels offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers, and more modern jet-air hand dryers, and a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London.
After washing hands and drying with the help of a warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the finger and 254% on the palm of the hand.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increases the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on the finger and 15% on the palm of the hand.
After drying hands with paper towels after hand washing, the total bacteria in the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and in the palms of the hands by 77%. Scientists also tested whether there was a possibility of contamination (crush-contamination) spread from place to place by other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying procedure.
The jet-air dryer, which emits air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microbes out of the hands and units and eliminate the potential pollution of the washroom users and the bathroom environment by up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer spreads microscopic organisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of micro-organisms. A 2005 study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes have been observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryer manufacturers exist and hand dryers have been compared with drying with paper towels.
Hand sanitizing wipes are an alternative to hand washing when traveling due to lack of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in the medical field was mandated long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the effectiveness of handwashing (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are some electronic devices that hospital staff give feedback to remind them to forget to wash their hands.
A study has shown that the rate of infection decreases with the use of them.
Medical hand-washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds and each part of the hand is used with sufficient soap and water or gel to remove the abrasive foam.
The fingers should be tied together.
A brush brush can be used to remove it if there is dirt under the nails.
Since germs can remain in hand water, it is important to wash the foam well and remove it by drying it with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water faucet (and open another door to exit if necessary).
This prevents contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in health care environments is to remove pathogens (""microbes"") causing disease and to avoid infection."
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the deficiency of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus causing microbial infections.
One study found that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published the ideal hand-washing and hand-washing paper in the Department of Health Care.
Draft guidelines on hand hygiene by the organization for public comments can also be found on its website.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance verification is required.
"The World Health Organization has ""five moments"" for hand washing:
After coming into contact with blood/body fluid
prior to the release of the virus, and
"After taking care of the patient. Antiseptic chemical additives (""medicated"" or ""antimicrobial"" soap) in soaps provide the ability to destroy hand washing ingredients."
Before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are present, the process of elimination may be inconvenient. It is important to scrub your hands for the operation. It is important to have a call to wash your hands, which can be turned on and off without touching other cleaning apparatus, some chlorhexidine or iodine for washing the hands under the microscope, after washing towels for drying the hands.
All doors must be opened.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub hands for a long time (10 minutes).
During the washing, the water from the wrist to the elbow must be prevented from turning to the palm of the hand again.
After the hand wash is finished, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of a sick person or to use antiseptics.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in the hospital, it was found that the maximum benefit of hand-washing was from the first 20% washing, and when the repetition of hand-washing was increased above 35%, the additional benefit was found to be very little.
Washing with ordinary soap than washing with antibacterial soap causes bacterial infectious diseases in the food at three times the rate. Hand-washing with antibacterial soap for a period of about 30 seconds compared with hand-washing with alcohol-based infusions. The reduction in hand-washing showed that 26% more alcohol than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water/water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rabs to reduce the virus and clostridium-difficil seedlings in H1N1 influenza A from hand. Hand wash, alcohol-based hand rabs in health care environments to improve hand hygiene. The staff may have written and verbal reminders about the availability of hand sanitizers.
More research is needed to determine which of these improvements are most effective in a variety of health care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, vital way to achieve health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools, and workplaces poses a challenge for achieving universal hand washing habits.
For example, although there are cheaper alternatives to creating hand wash space in most areas of rural Africa, there are rarely hand wash calls around every private or public toilet.
However, the low hand washing rate may be due to a deep-rooted habit, rather than a lack of soap or water/water.
Promotion and advice on handwashing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and lead to changes in people's long-term habits.
It needs to be evaluated, monitored and evaluated in order to work effectively.
"A systematic review of 70 surveys found that community-based practices at LMIC are effective in hand washing, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of a campaign on hand washing in schools is UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" that encourages schools to take easy, cost-effective steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other healthy requirements."
If the minimum standard is achieved, schools can reach three stars from one to the end.
Setting up a hand wash station can be a part of supporting the campaign to reduce the disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness raising campaign that is trying to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
A number of studies have considered the overall cost savings of handwashing in developing countries on the prevention of DALYs.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is relatively cheaper than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in unsafe conditions, such as mothers in hospital who have barely given birth or wounded soldiers - was recognized by the first two pioneers of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English."
By that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
With the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many countries have raised awareness about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from this type of infectious disease.
"For example, posters with ""correct hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets in Germany and next to the hand washing sinks of office buildings and airport toilets."
"Such a phrase ""to shake a person's hand"" means to take responsibility for the matter or to show displeasure for the person to be a partner in an evil act."
It originates from the part of the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate waved his hand from the decision to crucify Jesus, but it has become a language expression by more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, she began washing her hands in an attempt to clean up insanely imaginative stains by revealing her guilt feelings about the crime she committed and instigated her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, when they think or think of immoral acts, are much more prone to hand washing than others and are more prone to paying more for hand washing tools.
"Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such intentions are less likely to engage in other ""cleaning"" compensatory activities, such as volunteering."
For both healthy and symbolic purposes, religions order handwashing. Symbolic handwashing, using water/water for handwashing but not using soap, handwashing is a part of religious practice in many religions, including Bahá'í religion, Hinduism, Judaism, Tewillah and Netilat Yadayim, Lavabo of Christianity and some of the later hand-washing rituals in Islam.
Hand washing is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, before and after every meal, it is mandatory to wash hands in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Workplace Risk Control for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health-related procedures for risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and the work to be done, on the basis of a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the public, and the risk factors of individual employees who may be at risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure work involves minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which general measures to prevent infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene, and regular work environments.
Medium-risk jobs include jobs that are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but require frequent or close contact with people who may have been infected due to ongoing illnesses or international travel in the workplace.
This includes employees who have contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some overcrowded retail spaces.
In addition to early infection prevention measures, the risk control measures for this group include using improved capacity air filters to keep ventilation, snooze guards and personal protective equipment available when faced with a COVID-19 infected person.
OSHA considers the risk of health workers and people working in morgues being exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases as high as possible. The risk increases if these workers apply the aerosol-producing process, or by collecting or handling samples of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases through this procedure.
Suitable risk controls for these employees include engineering controls such as negative-pressure air circulation, and personal protective equipment suitable for job work.
The spread of COVID-19 in the workplace can have many effects.
Employees may be absent from work due to being sick, having to take care of others, or for fear of possible contact.
There is a demand for any products and the way to buy these products (such as shopping at a time when there is no busyness or through delivery or drive-through services (don't come down from the car), the type of business can change from either side.
Finally, sending goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be disrupted. A infectious disease preparation and response plan can be used to guide protective measures.
Plans aim at the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and work to be done, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the range of home and society, and personal risk factors of employees such as old age or chronic medical illness.
They also outlined the necessary controls to address those risks and plans to be prepared for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak of the disease.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Objectives of response to the outbreak include reducing infections among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business activities, and reducing the adverse impact on other companies in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community affects the responses received where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control is a framework that is widely used in regulating occupational safety and health performance.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be overcome, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal protection materials.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on the behavior of employees, and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement it.
Administrative controls are changes in work-related policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the employee's risk, as appropriate (e.g., respirators), must be worn consistently and appropriately, must be inspected, maintained and replaced regularly, and must be properly opened, cleaned, and stored or cancelled to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues.
The basic steps recommended for all workplaces include frequent and well-maintained handwashing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquette, covering their mouths during sneezing and coughing, cleaning and washing of tissues and garbage containers, if necessary, and preparing others to use the equipment and equipment used in the telecommunication or staggered shifts at different times of the day.
An essential step in protecting employees, customers, interviewees, and others at work is to quickly identify and isolate potentially infectious individuals.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home, unless they have fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications, for at least 24 hours without having to be used. The policy of allowing employees to be free of fever, fever marks, and other symptoms, and the policies of sick leave should be relaxed for those who are in the care of a sick family member at home.
According to the OSHA, medium-risk jobs in contact include jobs that are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 need to be in close proximity to six feet (1.8 m) or more frequently due to ongoing illnesses that have spread in public places of business or to recent international travel in places where the person has spread COVID-19 extensively.
For those employees who are in public contact, such as in schools, in high-density work environments, and in some shops with overcrowded populations, there is a need for COVID-19, for those who are in private care, and for those who are in private care, and for those who are in high-risk groups, and for those who are in private care, there is a need for COVID-19.
Employees in this risk group need to use respirators in rare cases.
If a person falls ill on a plane, the proper controls to protect the staff and other passengers include isolating sick people from others at a distance of 6 feet, specifying a member of the staff to serve the sick person, and giving the sick person a face mask, or telling the sick person to cover his face and nose with a cloth while coughing or coughing.
The cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to the call of the sick traveler or touching the body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly use additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other removable items should be discarded in a bio-risk bag, and the contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including recreation ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include delaying travel if sick, isolating oneself, and immediately informing the ship’s medical center if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
In ideal cases, the person who has been quarantined should have a medical follow-up in the cabin. In case of school and child care facilities, regardless of disease transmission in public, if an infected person enters a school building, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfecting.
When the disease spreads to a minimum to moderate level within the public, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or eating in a classroom or cafeteria; extending the distance between desks, visiting the office and setting aside vacation time, limiting unnecessarily visits to children, and
When the disease spreads a lot in the local community, additional school breaks in social distancing strategies may be considered. Enforcement of daily routine activities is considered by the CDC to reduce the immediate risk to the health of staff.
Law enforcement officials are advised to contact people who have or are suspected of having COVID-19, to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If employees come into close contact during times of fear, their duty belts and equipment should be cleaned and disinfected using a household cleaning spray or wipe before being reused, and evidence management procedures should be followed to control and cancel the used PPE.
OSHA considers certain health care and death-related services personnel in the high or very high-risk category.
High-risk contact jobs include healthcare supplies, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who come into contact with patients who are known to have or are suspected to have COVID-19.
If employees perform aerosol-causing procedures, or collect or move samples from patients who are known to have or are suspected to have COVID-19, they are at higher risk of exposure.
Aerosol-producing methods include inserting tubes, inducing wrinkles, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures, and collecting samples by inserting tests or materials.
High-risk, death-related jobs include people who were known to have COVID-19 at the time of death or were suspected to be involved in the preparation of their bodies; this becomes very high-risk if they perform autopsy. These are additional engineering controls for people in vulnerable groups—including procedures performed when they are known to have COVID-19, or for patients who are suspected to have a separate room.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable for some health care and shabakar environments.
The samples should be administered in accordance with the Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in individual waiting areas based on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19. Those who are known to have or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 recommend OSHA respirators in addition to other PPEs for people working within 6 feet and those who perform aerosol-causing procedures.
NIOSH-approved N95 or better filtering facepiece respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program, including health checks, training, and medical tests in the United States.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO Coverall does not recommend, since COVID-19 does not spread through physical fluid components, but rather is a respiratory disease.
The WHO recommends a surgical mask for screening staff only at the entrance.
For those who are taking care of or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-causing method, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gowns, and gloves.
If an aerosol-emitting process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
In view of the inadequacy of PPE supplies worldwide, WHO recommends the use of telemedicine, transparent windows such as physical intersections to reduce the need for PPE, and only those who are directly involved in taking care have been advised to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, to use the necessary PPE only for specific purposes, to continue to use the respirator while taking care of multiple patients with the same disease.

We are in a very special situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global event that makes it clear to us the global human interconnections and our responsibilities towards each other.
We have no prior experience for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the global empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of the organization.
The intimacy, trust, and care we have seen through email, calls and chats with all of our colleagues is a remarkable representation of the incredible people we are lucky enough to work with.
I am so grateful and proud of all of you.
Last week, someone shared their appreciation for our work with me.
They reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to be able to see Wikipedia at this moment and how powerful it is to have this important resource available online and to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether it's to keep the sites running or to pay our colleagues or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs more information than ever before.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will also have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant changes in the way we work together this week.
Keeping up with our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and set a schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response to the situation we were facing and the best way to sustain the company at this time.
Most of us wanted to get rid of the pressure and support our purpose for the long term.
No problem if you need to back up the dial.
For all employees, contractors, and contractual employees:
Expectations for our daily work until the next notification will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you're able to work at a more normal time, the mission can make you work.
But at the moment the world is uncertain, and whether it is necessary to take care of your loved one or to bring groceries or go to the doctor, your well being is our priority.
We don't control your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
It's hard to say, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team to revise the calendars and schedules to make sure that the core areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can help and ensure that your situation receives the appropriate attention from the authorities).
Full-time employees will be paid.
We have already said it, and we are committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and colleagues working as hours.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we can help you.
Many people use work as a way to drive their stress from the world around us to a certain direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager, so that we know what to expect and adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential tasks that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all of our departments to evaluate the current goals and change our focus to cooperate in what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, only we will focus on the most important projects.
If you work slowly, you won't get hurt.
We don't plan to work twice a day after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work within the timeframe, which is no longer realistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and deadlines.
What's going on with the annual plan?
In order to keep up with our new realities and the expectations of daily working hours, we also want to adjust the timeline for delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to offer an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will give employees more time to prioritize essential work, to take care of themselves and to prepare for the budget to give them the opportunity to care for a loved one, at the same time complying with the demands of people who want to work or need to do it in a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of time greatly reduces the pressure on the current planning staff and the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week and we will update the representatives and teams about the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the AP team for your leadership in this regard.
Cleaning, contacting and cleaning the office.
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But with a lot of caution, we hired a team of infectious cleaners to sterilize all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a virus-resistant solution to sterilize each surface and lobby and the elevator banks that entered our floor.
The building is hiring its own care protocol user products that help protect their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has exchanged its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office moved to a full-fledged remote setup in line with the instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing getting a place lease in Brooklyn.
Discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues know that this could be a adjustment, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours.
If more sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into smaller portions over a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, keep an agenda and send the texts in advance.
Default the video with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connectivity.
Keep a lead to facilitate each meeting, ask someone to monitor questions in the chat and keep an eye on the speaker list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes in collaboration).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Make use of your snippets for snippets.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work being distributed.
The HR team is focusing on webinar-based argonomics guidelines to help increase the foundation-wide allocation of work.
This past week, we have asked all community donors to cancel public events such as Editathon, funded by Wikimedia, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their agreed donation activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or modifying these goals.
This coming week we will be inspiring additional guidance for Wikimania and other regional and theme-based community conferences.
Depressed for the disruption of general attitudes from the entire global community, but at the same time in Wikimedia and elsewhere, there seems to be both the ability to focus on their own community and the salvation in clarity.
CRT is working to create a page in Meta-Wiki in the coming days, to provide a space for the public to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
In this situation, we are all united and we will do whatever we can to help.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and get other vital information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with employees currently living in significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream or coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please do not hesitate to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help and coordinate as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, please email Brian Judan, director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and responsibility.
Rather, it is an acknowledgement that at this moment, we may have to adapt to our tasks and responsibilities in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need for our movements, and provide the services the world relies on.
When the time comes, our planned work will wait for us.
Now is the time to help each other and make room for the important work that is going to come in the coming weeks and possibly months.
To do this, you need everyone's support, and that's why we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay healthy when you need it.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a stimulant attached to the outer membrane (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestinal cells.
ACE2 resists the work of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increases Ang(1-7) making it a committed drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal colectrine renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, in which the active space in the action of the enzyme is untreated on the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The outer domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddess, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted through the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane associated with the alveolas type II of the lungs, to the small intestinal enterocytes, to the arteries and veins of most organs, and to the endothelial cells, and to the artery muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the counterbalance of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I divides the hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-HyPro-IrH-AlVal)
ACE2 can distinguish a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinitrophin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates the membrane exchange of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is associated with heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the focal point for some coronaviruses to enter the cell, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that is responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that is responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cell leads to endocytosis and displacement of both viruses and enzymes in the endosome located within the cell.
This penetration process also requires the priming of the S protein by the host serine protein TMPRSS2, its inhibition being under current investigation as a potential healer. This has helped some to speculate that reducing the levels of ACE2 in the cell can help fight infection.
However, a number of professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of evidence-based ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""compared to controls, the risk of pneumonia was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of using ACE inhibitors."""
"Moreover, ""The risk of developing pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially in patients with high risk of developing pneumonia and heart failure."
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in the mortality rate associated with pneumonia, although the result was less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia."""
Recombinant Human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a novel therapy for acute lung damage and appeared to improve a pig's lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with signs of lipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of work is 30 minutes, also the duration of effect is 24 hours.
Various studies suggest that people who do not tolerate first-class renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or have an ailment where angiotensin II infection is increased, may show hope for rhACE2 symptoms for severe respiratory diseases.
"B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to identify contacts as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person (""identity"") who has been in contact with an infected person."
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
A number of infrastructures have been created to create communication detection apps.
Privacy concerns have been expressed, especially about systems that work on the basis of identifying the geographical location of the app users.
Relatively inaccessible entry options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log user-attack on other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would integrate the functionality of such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an application with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have been exposed to people with COVID-19.
It is used across more than 200 Chinese cities. An app called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The app has created a local information technology group, it has been published as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia “Stop Corona!”, a Bluetooth-based app that aims to detect the manifestation of symptoms of potentially infected person and provide a quick response from the healthcare authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app has been waiting for approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store since April 14, 2020.
"On April 12, the government reported that the connection search app is in a progressive phase of development and will be available to work in a few weeks. Similar apps (""StopCovid"") are planned in Ireland and France."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 disease-free patients living in Moscow to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including fall-positive and lack of functionality if the app's acceptance is limited to a small segment of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of malicious or malicious ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on which types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, while limiting it to ""public"" or otherwise reputable companies."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Those who campaigned for privacy expressed their concerns in the context of the interests of surveillance on the public using coronavirus apps, in particular, about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be eliminated after the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and hundreds of other organizations have issued a statement urging 100 to limit such surveillance.
The company announced eight conditions regarding the government project:
"The supervisor must be ""legitimate, necessary and proportionate""."
There must be a Sunset clause to increase surveillance and surveillance;
The use of data for the purpose of COVID-19 must be limited;
Data protection and anonymity must be protected and evidence-based protection must be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance had to be done to stop the spread of discrimination and alignment;
The sharing of any data with third parties must be made clear in law;
Citizens have the right to protest against abuse and protection against abuse.
"All ""relevant stakeholders"", including public health experts and marginal groups, will require significant participation. The German KO Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have issued a checklist."
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to remove the tracing process from the operating systems of their devices and solve the problem of constant surveillance if it is no longer needed.
Some countries used surveillance on network-based locations instead of apps, which eliminates both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was allowed.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location information have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all central servers require access to personal location data; multiple privacy preservation systems have been created that only use the central server for intercom (see section below).
An appless system was used in South Korea to monitor contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and transaction data on cards, and aggregating them to send notifications to potentially infected people via text messages.
In addition to using this information to warn of possible contacts, the government has made location information available to the public, some of which have been approved due to far-reaching changes to the data privacy law following the outbreak of MERS.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
It’s a well-established idea to identify privacy-protected communications with at least a practical component of research education starting from 2013 onwards. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording proximity to other cellphone users using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that consists of both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single behavioral code. Decentralized behavioral codes include decentralized privacy-preservation proximity identification (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, and other mechanisms for privacy-identifying (PACT), mobile communication.
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and occurs within all matching devices.
The MIT Media Lab is developing the Privacy Group SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protection strategies when collecting and using location or path intersection data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It’s based on a white paper called ‘Apps that have become fraudulent: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic’ (Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic) which was published in March 2020. Another similar effort was the Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company that manufactures privacy technology that was founded by MIT-Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of the information.
On April 5, 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was founded by some groups with the goal of reducing fragmentation and enabling universal interoperability to identify and warn apps, which were a key aspect of widespread adoption, including those that were essentially the same approach and large-scale overhaul behavioral codes that were needed.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had an open-source BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced an initiative to find people who have come in contact with them, which will protect their privacy as claimed, based on a mix of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also provided information about the technology used in the project.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three steps:
To enable governments to create a privacy-preserving official app to detect coronavirus, roll-out of tools
Integration of this functionality directly on iOS and Android: Google and Apple first distribute the system via operating system updates and later plan to fix the take-up and endless monitoring problem by removing it in the same way as the disaster is done.
B'drug repository (also known as a drug for use for various purposes, re-profiling, re-executing, or altering therapeutic drugs) is an approved drug that is used to treat a disease or disease different from the one originally designed for it.
It is a path of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convulsive plasma infection. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug target proteins each with multiple ligand binding sites.
By analyzing these binding sites, it provides a reasonable project of producing effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papine national proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., and others studied a variety of candidate compounds that were optimized and analyzed in his pre-clinical study for candidate skeletal similarities by the most similarly approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria-resistant drug that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity Diagnostic Test.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on March 24. March 28 allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only approved as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized under the European Union but are not able to participate in clinical trials.
"The CDC says ""the use, dose, or stability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections"" has not yet been proven."
"The doctors say they are using the drug ""because there is no other alternative""."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A large number of studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed Favipirabir to be ""clearly effective""."
In Shenzhen, in the middle of 4 days, the results of 35 patients were negative, while in 45 patients who did not receive it, the duration of their illness was 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia held in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence in support of the drug is inexhaustible and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy medicines from Japan for storage and use the military to supply medicines to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in terms of the severity of the illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to get pregnant.
"A study of Lopinavir/Kaletra, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs, concluded that ""no benefit could be observed."""
Drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to change drugs to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. There are criticisms in scientific society about using resources to change the purpose of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
Lopinavir/Retonavir is included in the International Mutual Support Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences later discovered that multiple Philo-, Pneumo-, Paramixo- and In-Vitro had Remdesivir’s antiviral activity against coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and infections.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies indicate that Remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials conducted by the Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with additionally severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for hospitalization and vein delivery for people with severe illness with COVID-19; two are placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one unregulated (Italy).
New York State began trials for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a diagnostic trial for Alvesco (cyclosonide) of teogene, a respiratory corticosteroid for asthma, to treat pre-contaminated patients with the novel coronavirus.
A type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 trial is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 critically hospitalized patients to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, was conducted on 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several antibiotics are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients and encourages the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multidisciplinary study on the use of anoxaparin sodium in preventive and curative drugs on 300 patients was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention has traditionally been focused on the reconstruction of approved anti-toxic drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 as per China's 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenvir: Umifenovvir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some of the antibiotics that have been identified as potentially new for the treatment of COVID-19 are:
Tosilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Tests are also being conducted in Italy and China, and see Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID-19.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a projected vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine clinical trials have been completed, several efforts are in progress to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the vaccine to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety research.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak spread around the world, leading to substantial investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many companies are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI's condition for the vaccine to be developed is speed, production capacity, large-scale implementation, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were working for research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform goals that have advanced to Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus-causing carriers (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Cansino Biology, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccinated people are in the early stages of improvement, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 as others, but all are from little known information (presumably planned).
Phase I-II testing is carried out on primary safety and immunity tests, and is usually invasive, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites when determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials, including the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention and the control group, usually involve more participants, while monitoring the adverse effects on the optimal dosage.
"From 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed as early as April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated humanely (still under ""pre-diagnostic"" research)."
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was exploring the possibility of a molecule-binding vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to trigger a immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Center (VIDEO-Intervac) announced the start of work on a vaccine with the goal of starting human body trials in 2021.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced the vaccine development projects on January 26, 2020, and the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Jansen is developing the vaccine in conjunction with its biotechnology partner Vaccart.
On March 18, 2020, the company announced a partnership with Emergent Bio Solutions to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, Onkozon, a laboratory in Romania, published a short essay on the design of a vaccine of the same technology used for neontigen vaccination therapy of cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, Newsnerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it was launching a vaccine project to develop an LI-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to create a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans within 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced plans to develop their vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical tests and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India's health ministry announced that it is working on 11 isolates and it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine at a rapid pace.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec's city of Quebec reported a partially funded coronavirus-like molecule development at the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing testing in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered to pay Kurivak a “gross sum” of money to get monopoly on the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical testing, is expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, an Italian biotech company called Takis Biotech announced that they would have pre-diagnostic test results in April 2020 and that their final vaccine candidate could be tested in the human body in autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a research committee for COVID-19 vaccines, including investments by the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience at the University of Tijuana, Austria, and Pittsburgh.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun six different vaccine candidate tests on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20 that they were preparing a self-extensive RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was made within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a C$275 million funding for 96 research projects on medical defense against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian organizations and universities such as the initiative of the University of Medicago and Saskatchewan.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically, and several new vaccines have plans to establish another national ""Vaccine Bank"" that can be used if there is any other coronavirus outbreak."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a possible COVID-19 vaccine trial called PittCoVac on rats, which stated that ""SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines extracted by MNA had strong antigen-specific antibody reactions [in the case of rats] that occurred at the beginning of the 2nd week of vaccination."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidacy as a potentially fake spray.
DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities created a unified resource to gain access to supercomputers from IBM, a combination of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can also be beneficial outside of the disease that prevents them.
Attempts are being made to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers for an additional involuntary trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that the vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research evaluation of the efficacy of the vaccine in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other animals in the laboratory and mammals that are not human indicates the need for biosafety-level 3 control levels and international coordination to ensure standardized protection methods for managing living viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the detection and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When the outbreak of MERS occurred, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed the first clinical trials in humans and three more are underway, all of which are viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS).
Social media posts have promoted the theory of a plot in which it is claimed that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts are related to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, stinking energy, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although mild symptoms appear in most cases, in some cases they can lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus is most often spread to humans through tiny spitting particles caused by coughing, sneezing or speaking during close contact.
When spout particles are produced during inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or above the surface, rather than spreading over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching their own eyes, nose, or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms begin, although it is likely to spread before and in the later stages of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis is by real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
Those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and their vets are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the use of masks are different for the general public, some authorities are recommending against their use, some are recommending their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be symptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blurred face or lips; immediate medical care is advised if these symptoms are present.
Relatively less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, watering of the nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea have been observed with a percentage difference.
In China, some of the cases were initially seen only in chest cavities and chest ulcers.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-organ dysfunction and death.
It's called the phase of biodiversity.
The outbreak period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will see it within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that the symptoms are not seen in everyone infected.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may have a role to play in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who did not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with reports from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) saying that 20% of all confirmed cases were symptomatic while in the hospital.
On April 1, China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases among its daily cases; 130 of the 166 cases (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing that day.
Both sputum and saliva can carry a high number of viruses.
It's easier to talk than it is to speak normally.
A study in Singapore found that small droplets that were not covered by the mouth can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol infections may be possible and that air collectors placed in people's outdoor hallways gave a positive sample of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can lead to respiratory discharges becoming air particles, resulting in airborne spread.
This risk is thought to be low, although there are concerns that it may spread through the mall. The virus is most vulnerable when symptoms appear in humans; it may be possible to spread before the symptoms become clear but the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person usually infects two to three people. The virus survives on the surface for several hours to several days.
Specifically, up to one day on cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in 99% copper were found to be identifiable to the virus.
It varies depending on temperature and humidity.
Soaps and detergents can also be effective if used correctly; savanna products break down the fatty protection layer of the virus, inhibit it, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (disinfectant related to atherosclerosis) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken between two days after hospitalization began.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the most full of the virus, and the sixth patient tested on the second day showed the most full of the virus.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to a group of people with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses that are related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in domestic soaps, which burst its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus enters the liver cells through the large amount of enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found in the lungs' type II alveolar cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (pepolomer) to connect to ACE2 to enter the foster cell."
12% of the infected people admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, were diagnosed with acute cardiac injury, and it is more frequent in severe diseases.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with the heart's ACE2 receptors.
ACE2 receptors move quickly to the heart and are involved in heart function.
Thrombosis (31%) and Venus thromboembolism (25%) have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and it may be associated with weak prognosis. Body-tests of people who died of COVID-19 have been conducted in the lungs to show damaged scattered alveolar (diffuse alveolar damage, DAAD).
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to move to the epithelial cell -ACE2 that connects the respiratory tract, acute COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-insulated monocytes and severe lung pathology relapse (recruitment).
Lymphocytic infiltrates have been reported in the body.
The WHO has released a number of testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is to use reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test is usually done in respiratory samples obtained by nezoferential swabs; however, nazal swabs or swab samples can also be used.
Results are usually seen in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but they require two blood samples taken over a period of two weeks, and the results have a low immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and release a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which could detect active infections and detect if a person had been infected in the past) were in preparation to develop, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience in testing has shown only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the FDA in the United States approved the first spatial epidural testing for use at the end of that month. The guidelines for the diagnosis published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend methods for the detection of infections based on diagnostic features and epidemic risk.
Bilateral, multilobar ground-glass opacity including a marginal, asymmetric and backward distribution is common in early infections.
Depending on the progression of the disease, subpleural predominance, irregular paving (lobular septal enlargement by filling the transforming alveolar) and consolidation can be observed.
There is very little information available about pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological data of the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Pleurisy, Pericarditis, Lung Consolidation (Lung Water Catching) and Pulmonary Swelling
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: intrauterine inflammation and multinucleated monster cell formation including pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large-scale atypical pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration
Severe pneumonia: Damaged diffused alveolar (DAD) with diffuse alveolar emitted substances.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia Sarano: Organization of extracts in the cavity of the alveolar cavity and interstitial fibrosis related to the lungs
Bleeding: Dispersed intravascular conjunctivitis (DIC); Leucoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include sitting at home, avoiding populated places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and practicing appropriate hygiene related to breathing and not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with adobe hands.
The CDC has recommended to wash the face and nose tissue during coughing or sneezing and to use the inside of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends using cloth face coverings in public to limit transmission by symptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce exposure to people infected with large-scale groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling mass gatherings.
Instructions for maintaining distance also include that humans will be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, known as ""flattening the curve""."
The CDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
The activation of antimicrobials in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antisepsis""."
Glycerin is added as a humectant.
Humans are driven by assistive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and assisting other severely affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus should wear a face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve respiratory problems, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatment may be effective in people with similar symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of those who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have organized the treatment recommendations of various organizations at the Free Resources, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of virus infection, especially in a health care environment when methods such as intubation or hand ventilation are performed that can produce airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people affected by COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping people in an airborne isolation room (AIIR) apart from using evidence alerts, touch alerts and airborne alerts. The CDC has described the instructions for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Recommended tools are: PPE gowns, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the respirator (instead of facemasks) is recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industry environments, but the FDA has approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but are not guaranteed for label-specific use against certain biological elements.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of homemade masks as a face covering or last resort.
Most people don't have severe COVID-19, but only a few percent have it.
The type of respiratory support is being actively studied in people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 for hospitalized people with some evidence of high-flow nasal cannula or by-level positive airway pressure to avoid intubation.
It is not known whether any of these two will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors choose to keep the invasive mechanical ventilation through if available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to the nasal cannula of high flow. Serious cases are most common in older adults (those who are over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of health management to cope with a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people infected with COVID-19 in hospitals are finally admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly uncomfortable.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP enabled ventilators are required to maximize oxygen distribution, while ventilators need to reduce the risk of corresponding lung injuries and pneumothorax.
High doses of PEEP may not be found in older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials of several antiviral drugs are underway.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to be manufactured, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with serious illnesses.
WHO proposed volunteers to take part in trials on potential treatment effectiveness and safety. The FDA has given temporary approval to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment where a person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
No clinical studies have been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'next contact' using surveillance data and ultimately the potential risk of infection.
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-isolation when potential risks are detected, it also warns local health officials. Cellphone data Big Data Analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor people infected and exposed in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor data on mobile phones of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect and enforce quarantine for people who may have come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also distributed data on the unified phone location to the German federal government agency Robert Kahn Institute for the purpose of preventing and researching the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify the quarantine breaker.
"Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators told him that ""40% of people are roaming around anyway""."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, also called for creative solutions around the world against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel sick due to quarantine, travel restrictions, medical side effects, or fear of infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are a perfect disaster to harm people's mental health and well-being."""
Similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common cold, the disease can progress with little or no symptoms.
Smaller patients usually recover within two weeks, but it may take three to six weeks for those with serious or serious illnesses to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk for severe infection to COVID-19 based on other similar virus data such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of information on COVID-19. COVID-19 in some humans can cause lung damage by causing pneumonia.
In most of the severe cases, COVID-19 acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) can rapidly increase, which can lead to respiratory dysfunction, septic shock, or multi-organ dysfunction.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
An abnormality of blood clotting in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, especially an increase in prothrombin time, has been noted, while abnormal renal action has been observed in 4% of the group.
Transaminasis has been observed in about 20-30% of people with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the time between the onset of symptoms and death, including those admitted to five hospitals, was ten days.
However, patients who were transferred to the ICU had a seven-day time gap between hospitalization and death.
In a study of primary cases, the interval between the initial symptoms, including the full six to 41-day period, was 14 days.
A study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of lung samples showed damage to alveolar spreads, including cellular fibromyalgia coming out of both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed on the pneumocyte.
Photos of the lungs are similar to acute respiratory illness syndrome (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome, ARDS).
Heart damage was identified as a result of increased levels of cardiac arrest or troponin in 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission.
According to the U.S. March data, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing illnesses. The socioeconomic status of a region and the availability of medical resources could also affect mortality.
The mortality rate from the disease is different not only due to regional differences but also due to systemic difficulties.
The death rate for mild cases can be calculated in excess.
However, the reality is that deaths are the result of past infections, which means the current mortality rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authorities noticed a reduction in lung capacity from 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
The likelihood of immunity is very high based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in those cases, the recovery from COVID-19 has been reported following the subsequent positive test results.
These incidents are feared to be due to a further deterioration of the permanent infection than re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has an animal source, through spillover infection.
The exact source is unknown, but the spread of the infection by December 2019 was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, where the first date of the onset of symptoms was reported as 1 December 2019.
Early onset of symptoms was reported by official publications from WHO on 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO specified the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths due to the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lab, and the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in the lab for clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 was specified by the U07.2 code for the time-to-date death due to the disease.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of deaths and cases worldwide as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) which identifies the percentage of people who have died from the disease and the infection rate (Infection Fatality Rate, IFR), which identifies the percentage of people who have died from the disease.
These figures do not have a specific time frame and follow a specific population from infection to diagnosis.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Cassiglione de Audda, is a small village of 4600 people, where 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In the Gangetic, the disease was spread through the Carnival festival and spread among younger people, causing relatively less deaths, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system has not been disrupted.
In the Netherlands, blood donors may have about 3% of antibodies as assessed.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women ends in their 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender-divergence are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may cause it.
Gender-based immunological differences, the incidence of smoking in women is relatively low and co-morbidity development in men at a younger age than in women, such as high blood pressure may have a role to play in higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
Since April 2020, the U.S. government has not been monitoring gender data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral illnesses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease would be ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means coronavirus, VI is the virus, D is the disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid mentioning specific geographic locations (e.g., China), animal species or groups of humans, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing cataracts. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"The WHO uses additional ""COVID-19 viruses"" and ""CoVID-19-responsible viruses"" in public connections."
"Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as ""coronaviruses""."
"During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus""."
According to the 2015 WHO Guidelines on the Use of Viruses and Diseases in January 2020, 2019-nCoV recommended acute respiratory diseases as a temporary name for viruses and diseases.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the power constraints in the ideal supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of healthcare components such as nail swabs and ventilators.
In an example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required timeframe, a local new company tested the manufacturer's product and produced the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumours about the origin, levels, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans are believed to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of replicating the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medication or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is underway by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "reciprocal support test" to assess the medical effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest commitment to efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several companies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, the researchers aim to create a full-fledged virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to eliminate the human body's immediate immune response to a new infection caused by COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system in a specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research targets the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, the innovative strategy for making the vaccine).
For safety and efficacy, experimental vaccines have to be tested from one of these strategies. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The genetic code that the virus causes is in the vaccine that does not harm replicating from it. The increase in antibody dependence has been pointed out as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being done to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine phase III tests on Remdesivir across different countries are expected to be reported by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of the diagnostic development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Lopinavir/Ritovir in combination with Interferon beta.
In March 2020, there is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir.
Significant improvements have been observed in patients who have been treated using the experimental drug Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, when recommending a dose of one gram per day, notes that double the dose of this drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical doctors treating people infected with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also included interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the context of COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicates that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further vivo studies after low concentration suppression of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated. Studies have shown that early spike protein prepared by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 penetration through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations that have prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir in vitro does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The next stage of severe COVID-19 can be a cytokine disaster.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have curative properties of cytokine. Tocilizumab has been included in the Medical Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after completing a small study.
After seeing positive results in people with severe disease, it is undergoing phase 2 non-communicable tests at the national level in Italy.
Blood tests in combination with serum ferritin to identify cytokine disasters are meant to prevent the growth of the disease, which is thought to be the cause of the death of some infected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA based on a past-related case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a separate cause.
To date, there is no invasive, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is a effective treatment for CRS.
Those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being sought as an unvaccinated method of inactivated immunization to those who need the refined and dense antibodies produced by the immune system.
This technique was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral inactivation is the expected mechanism of a special procedure through which passive antibody therapy can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of inactivated antibody therapy, for example, the use of produced monoclonal antibodies, are on the way to development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the blood-liquid part taken from recovered patients, and these virus specific antibodies can be extended for rapid organization.
Coronavirus Diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
