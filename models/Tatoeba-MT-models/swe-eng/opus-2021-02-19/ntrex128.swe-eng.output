AM in Wales is worried about "appearing like fools"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the parliament of Wales.
AM all over the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who don't speak Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means poop.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "displeased" and has suggested other alternatives.
A conservative Welsher said that his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the Assembly should be called is clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP was most supported in a public consultation.
AM apparently suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on the change of its name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will ignore the result.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silence when the churches of Harlem encounter problems
"Older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People hang out in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars are not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as far as the leaders expect and that sooner or later they will end up in square one again.
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's parish planned the renovation, they also built the chime.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first chime played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some hired by the church's laymanship, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church meeting – the governing body of the church consisting of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to transfer the cost" to the church meeting, even though the church meeting had not been involved when the diocese hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark damages 13-year-old diving for lobster in California
Last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he thought at first that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that the entire collarbones had been torn up.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" said Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is reported to be critical.
It's not clear what a catch it was.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma injuries on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's heading into Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty paths with beauty specialists.
As part of a substantial push into Britain’s beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the major beauty channels will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempts to fill the shelves that used to be taken up by TV sets, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offerings from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with marked areas, as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also launches its boutique makeup brand again so that most of the products are vegan – as more and more young customers require.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stalls in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an attempt to fight cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stands in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s earlier attempt to give beauty and pharmacy departments a face lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots' sales in supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty paths a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in convenient locations, we are now an alluring beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "raving" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "raving" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly, with casual clothes and accessories.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "racing" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer had time to focus on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
That would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise ready to be sold at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning presenter to withdraw can cost the company millions due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothes and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones own 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough talk, "and we fell in love."
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for being so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "news anchor voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament are stalled.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "equivalent response" from the US after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that the US was instead continuing sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"You're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results – an end to rocket tests, freed the hostages and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had lost their homes, a state of emergency was not announced, which is required for international aid.
"In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates it all," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr. Sutomo, the natural disaster agency spokesman, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in perfect conditions, travelling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and train tracks.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturrridge signed last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturrridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in the 89th minute at the Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturrridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target when his team was behind 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far post.
The experiment flew high above the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get in a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturrridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach and didn't think much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker fenced a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spun off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far post with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to VIdeoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 15:00 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be stuck in the debris of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters,” said the agency’s spokesman Sutomo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380 000 inhabitants, was full of debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest, 32, suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police will notify the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they can get back in.
A detective told a man that the entire area is treated like a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She says "it's so horrible" over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the perimeter and another one just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the perimeter with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell latest victim of quarrel over rewrite of history
An excommunication would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "killing" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The Iconoklasmen during the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a man who many believe should still be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended parliament against outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historic debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murderer Pig Kills Peasant
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood in a stia on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post last Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to inject vaccine into pigs in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the piggy bank with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250 - kilo [250 kg] pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 last Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid further attacks while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare for pigs to attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig stuck a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They nibble, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels across cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind power of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and travels east toward the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create vast heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mud flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trough brings local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of northeastern United States.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
Over 20 million watched Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute twist – Arizona's Senator Jeff Flakes' agreement with the FBI where they were given a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Sentiate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure Kavanaugh touched her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million recorded by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people watching from offices.
Comparably, there are as many viewers as there are for a football match in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second highest audience with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him trying to take a lift to an interrogation with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters shouted at him, which was shown live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he'll tell the country the truth?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the next week, as the minority Democrats have insisted.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "fully unreasonable".
Shoot of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police saying Sims dropped his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WABB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and to the neck.
Police are thanking Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, police state justice lab, Southern University police and residents of the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flit and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six - foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Last Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this stuff all the time," Wade said.
Volcano vomits ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and they registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mulles and quakes.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after independence demonstrators hit up with riot police while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by riot police threw eggs and paint powder at them, leading to dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours the Independence Groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region, which longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low as most opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1 000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote at election stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties in favour of independence have found it difficult to keep up the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in custody pending trial of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fired on by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
Last Saturday, Mr Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he is going to run for European elections next year.
"A candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drives into house
Three men — 33, 34, and 39 — have been arrested after a car was drove into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the profits
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's side still hasn't won a away win in Premiership this season and meets the Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning distance to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses out on the chance of cross-visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their straightforwardness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the target.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in certain games.
And that is how the decisive goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, who scored goals from the center of the target area.
At that point the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team’s defense was impenetrable and goaltender Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot widely from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two penalty demands – following Halkett’s challenge by exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves credit for galvanizing the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilfully organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall straight through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not measure – they only opened the home page once – and there is something of an alarm clock for the Rangers, which lies in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue skies (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become at odds over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duelling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by certain German Turks and condemned as a one - violent ruler by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trafficked road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the paramedics were called, but the man died at the scene.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and notify his immediate family.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been diverted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards wounded in a tumult
According to Prison Office, six prison guards have been injured in unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialised "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those who are behind it will be attributed to the police and may be given extended prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to prison to deal with serious civil unrest where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dried areas can benefit)
It is rare for tropical low pressure to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy surges across the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border."
The National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, probably receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force this Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may experience heavy rain, which represents a considerable risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5 to 15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona’s border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to their cell phone to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, evil, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthlessness and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump to his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered from the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his supporters in the audience of West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats are trying to "receive and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds dead in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, numbers rising
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities last Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach at dusk and swept many out to a certain death and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutomo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone, but carried cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the high seas for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are twisted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times as big as the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," said Nugroho.
"There are over 300 000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," they said.
The agency was criticized last Saturday for not having informed that the tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building shouts frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes toward the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not instantly authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a major power outage that interrupted all communication around Palu, making rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for relief work and remains closed to other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
People from World Vision in Donggala have made it to Palu where they seek shelter under tarpaulins in the yard outside the office, but they saw havoc along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have begun to work hard on aid, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it's a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status hasn't been announced yet."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that illuminate gloomy natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
Last Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman trapped under debris for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paraglider team coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a paraglider veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the paragliders heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got one gray goat, instead of two blue.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 under ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who restocked an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM in the entertainment facility and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy "sprawling another man up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter last Saturday and said, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled for "emotional reasons" according to the creator of the program.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word that is most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only one', to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, all.
The album is like a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a series of famous rappers who's changed their names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza last Saturday "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
US should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the US does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
A double budget could double the chances that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, Lee said to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top ranked American Othello player, and later he was in the lead of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the US government, such as Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading university personalities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants grants to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has made no progress in months.
Macedonian referendum on renaming
The people of Macedonia voted last Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the 'North Macedonia Republic', which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which has hindered the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he does not intend to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing the name if it allows Macedonia, one of the countries that was formed when Yugoslavia split up, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities were reported at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I am voting for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are voting in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Stromica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and place out chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote in favour, because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Survey Institute, between 30 and 43% of voters were planning to vote in the referendum, which falls within the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them were going to vote in favour.
For the referendum to count, 50% of registered voters plus one must vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western Government's policy since it took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes it through the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a passport from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green sweaters.
He got around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the target area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton’s goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored in that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League struggle.
Target arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far post.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it got out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competitive Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, which is a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance at the playoffs.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for his first division title.
“We play for nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
The Nationals haven't announced their departures for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they're leaning towards letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, horrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They're determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their meanness, their horribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them have it."
Democrats, he said, are struggling to "receive and prevent".
"You've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive and mean and horrible and false."
He mentioned the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was met by high booing from the spectators.
"Remember what she said?
'Did you leak the document?'
'Eh, uh, right?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, something of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe – ironically similar topics for which Jeremy criticized former leaders.
The announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, however, many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendlyr, gentler" politics has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever even began.
It has become increasingly apparent that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected me to make a turnaround and take positions that I would not otherwise have agreed with – whether in terms of national security or in terms of the European internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – I follow a tirade of obscurity on social media that demands my dismissal, criticises my policy and says that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this era's policy is the level of insults that is now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church, and with every censure and change in the selection rules the party is becoming increasingly narrow.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too forthright, so "it's up to you."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government, which literally made my elementary school classroom fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the motion on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leaders.
However, my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to depose me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unbeated Ayr on top
Two last minute attempts may have distorted the result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now on top, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the profit, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our games so far and are still unbeaten, so we are of course happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Ayr's actions Captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose once again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line-out behind Ayrs maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant business after it has been discovered that he has been designated as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Astormorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastal Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rig-capped naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and it is also a longing to sail again on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in decades now that Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on the first of October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the drive, the atmosphere of unity and peace, and of course waits for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that, after years of irregular discussions, Chile must negotiate with Bolivia to allow its own outlet to the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court is judging in Bolivia's favour, and that not much would change even if it does.
The United Nations Court, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not replaced ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to embark on a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of resolving the deadlock for nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "wishful dream" that continuing sanctions and the US protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first embarking on significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against Pyongyang's real intention to get rid of an arsenal of weapons that it probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line huge headwear on the way to stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of wacky, oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style icons of Paris fashion week.
Amazingly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat brim that completely took over the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn together lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with snorkel and dive mask, and another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up that huge courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge bonnets may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a brim of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia lashes and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other community engagement.
With up to 30 000 pupils in Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement custom curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students received the A in the Higher Grade final test.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of Mandarin students received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subject choices are now considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that employers had difficulties filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
That being said, language skills are becoming all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choices, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in total in a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and bring them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After practicing earlier this week James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Campaign Event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by his candidate for the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-year elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the run-up to the November elections.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's hearing of the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense after allegations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs for the November elections.
Thus, President Trump said that these five gatherings next week aim to "involve volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named to Reuters.
The night’s event, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can bring in fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to keep hopes alive for Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the competitions this Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the leg is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever face competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now there are four, so we wear it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and took home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example.
The winning calls rang even louder as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had lagged behind by two after two games.
His putt who won them the game in 15 met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup’s undeniable story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions state that they are the players to hit on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could win a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on front nine sank the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole that they never even came close to crawling out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Four ball and foursome are so fascinating to see up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead for the last day but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup the last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's lighthouse and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and took home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started during the morning's lighthouse with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend is just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5 & 4.
Woods, who beat through two games on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in foursome and foursome, and of that seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not have a tailwind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a four-point disadvantage in single games, however, Furyk's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that they will "never" disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible that it would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that over the past year North Korea had taken "significant steps to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test installations and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang had previously done.
Mr Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Mr Kim Jong Un and Mr Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim promised to work towards "nuclear decommissioning on the Korean Peninsula" while Mr Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also turned down negotiations to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "dismantling first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion and even objects to the "declaration to end the war," says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Mr Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament had been South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such an impasse."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US mainland with rockets was inevitable after Mr Evil President Trump called Kim a rocketman on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but it said that much work still remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue forcefully and without failure until we achieve complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Mr Pompeo met Mr Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear rig complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled "days".
One academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often unsuspecting about the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the students' behaviour directly.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in the fact that "day" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has studied one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the high-performance department.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target lowers Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 down team in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home its first victory on the road since February’s 4-1-triumf at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team delivered Gerard’s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hart’s.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers never even out the result.
While the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind the Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the lye for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerard made eight changes to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, joined the same Livi 11 who scored a score from the Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-murdered game outshinest opponents each time.
The Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been goals already two minutes into the game when Mengas' first pass let Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's call.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's opening shot for the 34th minute may have run counter to the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their nagging deserved it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob’s permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher went to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the winger hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opposite players to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long fit after long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened its lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was battling Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger meter.
Geiger meters have become the foundation stone of science since then and also feature prominently in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring in the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines help the immune system recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then be reinjected
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great hat, he ranted against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the playback of West's layout was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I dropped low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to go low too?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what I can do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try it with love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said: "There was a death silence in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STAYING AGAINST THE MOBBLE."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollegan, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
The ones for attempted murder after knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-turning role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken out negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her fellow actor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, admitted that he feels "pretty strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strongly, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is native and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think that is really one of the big issues of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men".
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife because of the show, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family holdings in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred through six and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses personnel leaking GOP Senator data, covering up "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lieds, lies and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly received online criticism, including from White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They can't be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the questioner.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to remove Waters in the middle of his term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with British tilt, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodys that was kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satire about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export commodity?
Anyway, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has got his license to screw up sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comical creation designed for biopublic even in non-English speaking countries
He is of course the weird secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims to smoothieglamour has received a small piece of Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE film
I loved it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval armor and when the rotor blades for a short while hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels rather low-key and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" film brands 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humor feels as if it's adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English's strange pranks are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film bravader in the role of Bean.
The constant issue is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents out in the field, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard pressed figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of her political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey stick role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer fight: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical pranks: dressed up as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but even though the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderately all in all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for the British to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a radical plan that involves the British working a four-day week - but being paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to hand over savings made by the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trades union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits in with the party's attitude to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party The Greens, which promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there is nothing the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless leaders" and "snitters" of government companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot recover their entire contribution, as a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive to have been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create "Inclusive Ownership Funds" where 10 % of the private company's own capital is handed over to its employees, who then stand to receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell on TV "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's investigations could lead some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the statement came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's vote, however, seems unshakable.
"I've already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of her names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive display of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pilgrimage to the Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international propaganda group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or in other meaningful ways contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of convincing people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "documents" from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that so far the collected assets have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are committed to "help children develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can do social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programs aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on his website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's event in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its fleet in a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports says the Interior Minister
The government can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he has said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the sea routes are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are indeed the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "dayfly" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump administration's aim has been to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration's officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington's opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position had a setback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading trade association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I very much dislike the fact that a third party disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia's President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "decent thinker" if she's going to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take an "arranged thought" about her participation in the presidential election after the US mid-year elections.
During a city hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to think hard about running for president."
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the Council Hall meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed for a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make his official decision in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now that he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and airmen and all the other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempted obstruction of a report on domestic violence and intoxicated possession of weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial review directed at a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members' sons", assaulted her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision by immigration authorities from 2014 that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignorates decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances to which the claim relates, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary labour force".
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases no longer to grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu when the death toll doubles in pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly gloomy.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a scarce commodity."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through water - damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, injured in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to run.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page ad in an American newspaper about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a contribution to Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper of the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to participate in the 6th US Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington designed to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other's imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the bullying by posting propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising ads in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economy, because the media are ruled by the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare off female voters for the middle-year election through the Kavanaugh fiasco, warn analysts
Since many top Republicans defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faces multiple allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn back the clock," says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesters chanted "November will!" as they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go down," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already been loud, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony of allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh coming through, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those of at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend’s project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's an historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on the cutting edge overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military’s most prestigious prize.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick mist and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led the "great bravery" line forward before he alone settled the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble to."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feeled very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stopped all night to see the Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 games, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were unimpressed after staying awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's show as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they'll be working on their scheduling to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution when it comes to reruns," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the change of program upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was in fact a state issue.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of six - as we normally do. We got in over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his peers while growing up because of his sexuality - but it also spurred him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show’s regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate of LGBT rights and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that his crush on a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics at 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said Dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got their tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 - where he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home audience in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and still gave him chills.

Mickelson in shape on the bench during Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will break record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of events, as he has often been to the United States, the fivefold winner spent his day between being a cheerleader and training his game in the hope of getting a chance to show off his abilities.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape for the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long ruff often hits hard.
It is not only the course that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday meets Mickelson champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below for the 12 single games, have a tailwind at the start, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is fine.
He is a celebrity and he has contributed so much to these teams in previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's what it is and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a thing of the past
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the final day singles of the Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made her debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero’s leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won barely," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead by 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with his players' performance on a tough golf course and added: "I would never be able to do this by myself.
Tomorrow, there are new challenges ahead.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that apply, and that is a completely different matter.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
That is the message that you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of big turns during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he finished as a loser when Europe ran "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the tempo starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We did our work and placed the guys as we wanted to to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said about his single choices.
Germany’s new warship postponed again
The German fleet's newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leading ship of the brand new Baden-Wuertemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and marine target missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they come into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuertterberg class will be driven by a staff of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, leading to a deterioration in performance and limiting the ability of the navy to carry out future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rhineland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from faulty hardware, the entire project price tag - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet is actually "begining to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said that this is a growing problem, as old ships were dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow South and Dwarf Pipistrell as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as meadow creation and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Great Britain have declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from house treasures.
Bats aren't blind, actually.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, examine nests and sometimes perform rescue operations.
It has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threeve we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before carrying out maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we do not know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "false news" and says that people "want to market themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) turned down the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral injury in an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "feared of retribution" and was concerned about "become humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "fearing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer announced that the effects of border delays in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts that come every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could lead to disruptions at the border, as the industry says, can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and hence production would have to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4's program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "shot in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues," said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, investigating Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing wiretap devices to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th Amendment of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his resignation appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee's hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a delay with a week given all the other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would dispute that statement: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters who "play for the gallery", although she said: "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more question sessions than any president before him," she said and added without quoting evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the combined reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express its gratitude and desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the decentralised public sector of the country.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continued, with a view to decisions expected this autumn.
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over Europe, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before he was placed on a stretcher was taken out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/coverage of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which gave him a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers pay higher stamp taxes when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to the Tory Party's new plans
The action will neutralise Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional charge is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and dwellings purchased for rent, which may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to GBP 120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first time buyers to get a foothold into the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new move comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "deplorable housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a startling range of proposals for housing reform, including rent ceilings and an end to evictions without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes as it is for hard-working people in our country.
The dream of owning one's home has become a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to sometime become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shot looks forward to the challenge of blowing life into the club from north-eastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game on the B national team and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotlands Sportsound.
"But when I was growing up, I looked at Scotland a lot at Hampden with my father, and it's always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Ross' representatives as coaches for Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a large club. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now I'm assessing success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just consider myself successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15 month probationary period as a member of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa to get back from the move to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close down to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembers and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had all right results and could live pretty well on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot to get through every week.
It is still stress and pressure at work for me, but to practice feels quite right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I've ever felt during my entire adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has meant increased revenue for the country's struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The fall in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolutely best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs that offer food also had difficulties in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The verdict on managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales went down by 3%."
Paul Newman, serving and entertainment analyst RSM, says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in terms of sales in the supermarket market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still face difficulties, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come any more inopportune for companies run by food sales. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August give someone much needed respite."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub and restaurant industry collects and analyses data on 47 active groups with a combined turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram sites
The result has increased concern that sexual content is being put up there.
20% of students reported having a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary and secondary school pupils showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image-sharing service.
The result has diluted the concern that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of the students said they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "rape me."
According to the study, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
The chairman of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are enticed to create places on the internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the elections as an outstanding opportunity for those leading sport to benefit from her broad experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers to cows share internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused disputes on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous announcements to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song with lines of text like, "Yeah, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail," and "If you didn't know, this isn't a udder, it's tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused battle on the internet.
The film has received 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "fears".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and feed in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them just a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But sure, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What a reality-averse commercial."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is genius.
I would have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumpkin made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is an ingenious product," someone writes.
Another comment: "This is a fun commercial that turns to mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like 'coss'."
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump tucked into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognisable way what incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London's fashion week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk with clothes from designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has skyrocketed, although the number of people crossing the border each month remains relatively unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government have made it more difficult to place children with reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and are afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to fingerprint and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since before.
"Almost 80% of people who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the practice in the past, according to the staff of the centres.
Many of them are present on a video link rather than in person to bring their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely it is that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to personnel at the centres and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that anxiety is rising at larger plants such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is having difficulty are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends, the traumas many are already experiencing can be exacerbated.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem underlined that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Damascus government would continue to "fight this sacred blow until we have freed all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2 000 soldiers in Syria, who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that moves refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They politicise something that should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel stronghold Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ruled out a large-scale attack by Russian-assisted Syrian troops on the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-connected Nusra front, who "will be wiped out".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and members of the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mr Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "review of the articles of the current Constitution", warning of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election in 2020 if his presidency were not terminated prematurely by impeachment and scandal, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that the viewers have become tired.
Since 2014, the best-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the lists of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are attracted to, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", which deals with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.

She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, Washington reports can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 ("a garment full of hubris", as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I myself will never see Super Mario the same way again.
"Some of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes up with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars", about the Trump Companion's rotating cast and daily intrigues (mug quarrels with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you'll be left behind.
When I talked to TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he was sitting and owling indoors watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not tear himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be brought before the Senate Committee of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs back in the day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever for the middle-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th Congress district receives lots of money, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This recently defined suburban district in Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally changed in favor of the republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding battle between the major party financial sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a small win in a wide guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congress district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the democrats a certain head start.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for Chinese aid but then backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the co-owners evicted the Trump organization's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. State Department decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "just recently made a decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said the department's spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017. The money was to go to drug control and development and provide financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the US.
However, in mid-September, senior administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Pence will now speak at the conference, which is now due to take place in mid-October.
And the three American emissaries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, two of them diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study history
The next inevitable step could be the Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse of justice, for which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that Assembly just as he prepares to stand again in the elections, and perhaps finally to a citizens' jury.
There are many uncertainties in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We must all make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how protracted the struggle can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the relentless advance of democracy is either speeded up or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What if Donald Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he had last year proposed secretly recording the President, speculating that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times reports aren't right.
"How are we going to answer if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may take office in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And most of all, in the middle-year elections, are we going to vote for a congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I do not think we will fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath candle on the table decorated with the swastika.
With it as an inheritance, how could I be anything but an optimist about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in the Rangers is an optimist for the meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal that ended in a draw earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 game against Villarreal. However, he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for greater success.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game thinking we could get something, and walked away with a point.
We might have got it in at the end, but on the whole it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and were the better team.
This Thursday will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result at their last game, but if we have the audience with us we can surely advance and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The squad is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be taken care of, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them how you want it in good time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can be of great importance for the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with own funds, if you can afford it.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal battles from the beginning.
Establish a healthcare authorisation so that you can appoint a trusted person to review your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals follow your wishes if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you then be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It is not only the economy that is at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What drugs are these?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready."

The injuries are not life - threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the town of Palu in Indonesia last Friday. It states officials. The death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are out, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administration area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main town in the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated at 379 800 persons in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area extending over 300 km of the coast of north-west Sulawesi.
In 2017, the administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 persons.
The pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian Emergency Response Agency.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Even in 1996, Western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the cirkumpacifian seismic ring of fire, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the north Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with the magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with the magnitude 7.6 struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with the magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten metres was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the administration area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been charged with assault.
Palin, aged 29 and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for interfering in a domestic violence report and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody in Mat-Su custody and is held on bail for $500 to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious class A crimes, which means that he can be sentenced for up to a year and $250,000 fined.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crime according to class B, which is punished with a day in prison and $2,000 fined.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being dealt with by the Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of interfering in reporting domestic violence and of possession of weapons under influence in connection with that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, originating from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia last Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies showing when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are pressing for rare death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rental truck from the construction and interior design chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan. He mowed down pedestrians and cyclists in his path during the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may involve a death sentence, according to the court action.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, often used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "comprehensive planning and intent", said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way Saipov performed it as "detestable, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has not prosecuted in a case claiming the death penalty for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he informed investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked to set up the IS flag in his hospital room, reported the police.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 charges in the charge.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who stated that they are "by far disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to insist on the death penalty instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the defendant pleads guilty only prolongs the trauma caused by these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to press for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at Torie's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel the heat" from the Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MEPs proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member, Peter Bone, at the March in Birmingham, said that the UK would already have "departed" if Nigel Farage had been Minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May to reconcile deeply divided supporters has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attacks by Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "wash the Chequers Agreement".
He indicated that Mr Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the district of Wellingborough in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must ditch the Chequers agreement".
He expressed his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the claims that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party also attended the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say: 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular among the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our election workers who are out on the streets and making sure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Prime ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be allowed to "feel the heat" if they fail the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not gonna let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilising the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say that they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus plus agreements, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning a "decent thinker" to run for president.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "decent thinker to run for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future at a city hall meeting in the West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might take on Donald Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman on top.
One person arrested for shooting the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for shooting the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who appears in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," said Police Commissioner Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 spore.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and taken to East Baton Rouge police custody.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion title after team orders gave him win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung out Hamilton to dry as he defended his position during the first two shipyards, and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel went into the depot first and had Hamilton drive into the back of the cluster, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in the pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after some wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of bidding in place after a double stroke to defend himself in the third curve.
The Max Verstapp started in the back row and lay seventh at the end of the first lap on its 21th birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived in the depot at the 44th shipyard but was unable to speed up during the remaining eight shipyards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court judge, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly bring up the testimony of Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't done it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.'
Wait a minute.
"Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter containing details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't covered up Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein said to the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia doesn't seem to fit the president, who during Saturday night's meeting commented on it like this: "Let me tell you something.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual crimes by three women, and he indicated that the democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the president according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off Friday’s loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants got an early two-goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer restored the Belfast Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard accepted for Dundee before two cases from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe’s team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who received the receipt at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first intermission when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard reciprocated with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team’s fifth half-way through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be playing at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on one plane could escape from earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the debris of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, then on the runway, was able to lift safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to over a thousand people. The country’s emergency relief authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutomo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will meet with there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes at Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after an airplane has crashed into a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now reports a missing man. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the airport on the Chuuk Islands.
Officials stated on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and the course of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane slipped past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through waist - deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 30 - meter - deep waters.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have been killed in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its plea in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
US DOJ analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone records to piece together the 29-year-old addressed Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday, saying that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing session on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hip-hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
One black again?!
A nanny in New York sues a couple for dismissal after a "racist" text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a missent text message from the mother, complaining that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood to "extortion".
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A BLACK AGAIN", wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "nice at ease," and fired Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal. She claims compensation in the order of $350 a day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would last six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reject the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only thing straight was to end Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "extortion" and said that his wife would have a baby two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you supposed to go after a person like that?
That's not very nice," added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It's very funny, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
"He was rather quiet about himself, and not some boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even if it is not man who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little that way.
Even if it was his creation and his imagination, he would always give Paddington the credit himself."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she would die within two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was put out.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not howl or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to pull myself together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bent my head down, and my tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells us that her son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling after killing himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry all the time about the consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "in order for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quietly, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother died.
"He hadn't said he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It rips up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to fight on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts an investigation.
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - then we could perhaps get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would "split" because of deep-rooted differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the timing.
The middle-year elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6th. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "sink" under Kim
The number of North Koreans dropping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, says 1 127 people dropped out last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher fees for smugglers, are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees defectors as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back by force.
The North-South relationship, which is still technically at war with each other, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks focusing on the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to be free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Secretary of State, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances we absolutely cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee of Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of sexually molesting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening address, Kavanaugh was very emotionally moved, and from time to time he almost screamed and his voice was stalled when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "grotetic and coordinated character killing" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased to the detriment of the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected, and if the democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade abortion case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to get into court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to put up with it.
It's a righteous criticism, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she talked to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And so she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to vent anger partly because they are often fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried with indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they managed to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president himself.
"It was not a well thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was late out, she was behind on the fundraising, promising not to go in as a candidate if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the voice was stalled.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls speaking of the reactions of the press.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my tombstone?"
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the rift between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing customs duties on key Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which means in practice that half of all goods coming into the US from China are subject to customs duties.
Beijing has responded each time with the same coin; recently, charges of between five and ten percent were thrown at US goods for 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match US action. The world’s second largest economy is unlikely to slow down in the foreseeable future.
Getting Washington to back off means bowing to demands, but publicly crawling to the United States would be far too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to admit," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary returnees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or help from countries that have supported the uprising.
Europe resigned with victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final score 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the knockout on the 16th hole par 3 course, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 of the European team’s lowest ranked player, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European of the tournament ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could be of help,” said a moved Garcia after the European team’s victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him, said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
An odd statistic for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing achievement: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We're regrouping, I'm gonna work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You're allowed to bow and bend.
They played better than us."
Algae bloom: Lower levels in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algal bloom concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, more uneven flowering is reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
The algal bloom stretches over 200 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about a mile out into the sea outside the main municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Algal blooms have also been observed in the major municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the Hillsborough coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium high concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida this past week.
