It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that this animal’s plumage was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The finding also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, so-called coil, but have other characteristics of feathers — rays and bi-beams — the researchers concluded that the coil was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used to fly but instead for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen show an adult plumage and not the chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers argued that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young down.

By means of brightness and rotation, the star’s rossby number is determined, which has to do with plasma flows.
The lower the rossby number, the less active the star is in magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by forces similar to the tides of the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts attraction on earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists found that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the largest part of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of mass of small particles.

Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview he said that the new variant was ""very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate.""
Some patients may have been infected with the bacterium in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, of which at least two were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
On the other hand, it seems that the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330 000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put an oppressed sheet of paper with their elected candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voters, the voters place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedure fairly strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the competent voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision, and who follow specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
"Vice Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We've arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared at the courthouse with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused of murdering her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but all eyewitness evidence can be worthless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have regarded the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University states that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish images etc. of suspects.""
The Criminal Department (Crown Office), which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has told journalists that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the six-day war in 1967.
Other topics reported are Jerusalem’s future, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while PA only agrees to leave such presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplemental pest control study were to be closely monitored by parkkeepers, when the study was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional election council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth provisional election council in the space of four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some that have lapsed since 2011.
There have been reports of some 60 cases of misconstructed iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) said that 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"METI announced last week that Apple had informed of 34 additional incidents with overheating, which the company called ""relieved.""
"The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report ""very regrettable.""
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Nordmarian Civil Protection Service announced that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 gun on the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six scourges, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she needed a toilet visit. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to examine premature births during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the fetus’s pulmonary maturation.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators salvaged two black boxes on Wednesday.
Wrestlers also hailed Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman."
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I ... maybe even bigger ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she's better off where she is now.""
Out of 1,400 people questioned before the federal elections in 2010, the number opposed to Australia’s becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Liked claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elisabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swam 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles there have been doubts about his condition.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number so far, January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Kometer may have been a source of water resources on earth, along with organic material, that can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, took up his rule earlier this year and signed last month a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
"He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will be running for the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that FAA claims would mean that the planes fly shorter distances, save millions of litres of fuel each year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to older ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is deployed, and trains over ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
Fear of lack of transportation opened up the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team’s supporters.
A study published last Thursday in Science magazine reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin fink, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating Español adarwin fink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn to thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called ""enlightened manuscripts""."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes shade depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The PH value is derived from the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together. Then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Residents of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth’s atmosphere distorts a little of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet treasures) who eat a much larger amount of small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it from rivalling others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called flocks.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are often closely related; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like flocks of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly like lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is part of the same group (the family Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar is not like the lion’s loud roar, but more like a meaning of growling, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (change) by sniffing on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and even move very stealthily. Ocelots chase their prey by blending into their surroundings and then throw themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small stock) are separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back), they often end up in a different environment than the one they used to be in.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so in order to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they had previously needed.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
In time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look smaller and smaller like the second population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe and they take up carbon dioxide that people emit (that is, breathe out).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other Mosasaurs.
The long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant that there was no chance of escaping for something that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue; its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feast elements such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called hazel mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half hang on the side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals cannot have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods who were considered to be the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid - shaped towers, called ziqqurater, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked on the farm; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Nordic fairy tales say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as a punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west, Greenland found and named it Greenland.
Whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already alive there at the time.
"Even though each country was "Skandinavi"" there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written." The text appears on the underside of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment ( measuring 75,6 cm x 62,2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings of Day D and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were French people who had come to an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks the Americans and the free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilization, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which even somehow defines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations: a civilised culture involves the transfer of knowledge between generations, a lingering cultural footprint and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognised as real civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as their sole component - according to the confederation articles.
The Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national exercising power or judiciary, it fell on the governments of the States, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all Länder before they could be added and the Länder attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy’s national football team, together with the German football team, is the world’s second most successful team and was champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bike, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch Eastern Indian Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the origin production of cereals and hired Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat of 1895 in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then governs the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is its image ratio inherited to the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-milimeter format is, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The page ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest full-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The very abused and often ridiculed third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a certain order in a picture.
It is claimed that the best location for the subject is where the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had linked European states in spite of their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity says that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain began a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the necessary military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the last two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Given a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most residents and countries.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation being repeated in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to join Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each stadium in China’s history, or every family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods were the three kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between Han and Jin Dynasty.
During these periods violent warfare was often waged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history when thousands died in battle to sit in the highest chair of the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all applicants men, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since rank in the army was now based on calibre instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to make revolution.
"Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He would often visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to ponder."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed’s spiritual tendencies.
The cave, located on one of the peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave it's total isolation.
You can see nothing but the bright, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The great pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid of Cheops is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the killing of pharaohs.
"Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the valley of Egyptian Death contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller grave monuments, several temples and the great sphinx."
The pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The mark for "up-street" looks like a V and the mark for "down-street" is like a staple or a square with no bottom."
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means you should start at the froschen (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
A straight line usually generates a softer sound, while a straight line is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but remember that the printed string markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris on October 6, 1789 by a bunch of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a chariot surrounded by a crowd shouting and calling out threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep their wagon windows wide open.
On one occasion one of the participants in the mob swung the head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street's banks.
Of course, the great profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era of events is often referred to as the period of European history in the 11th century to the 14th century.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the older Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces many different ideas in practice, from the fact that technology drives development or the technological imperative in the strict belief that man's destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned."
For example, it could be said that the motorized car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new health care technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romance contained a great element of determinism originating from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals, and in time, customs and culture arose related to this geography, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate at about A.D. 400 and continued until about A.D. 1,100.
Its influence decreased during the 14th century mainly because of the fact that Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 1100s and 1300s.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, the styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sustaining agriculture is agriculture that is carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-catering farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society and let them find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to members' age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that determine a subculture that is pronounced may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults during their childhood by neglect, accident or deliberate abuse.
"Such children are called "wild". Some wild children have been shut in by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When the wild child is brought up entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviour (within physical boundaries) almost entirely identical to that of the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to man.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support teaching goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but support for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the small gem man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is meant to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage on his own.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not educational, caring or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster home system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system should provide safe homes, loving care providers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster homes are designed to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Also ""personal engagement"" and "continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the public's reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing "The President's speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shovel variations back and forth between the two poles of each new generation.
Out on the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from the plants available.
In addition, a lack of this has serious consequences; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
By comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also offers high quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively silent alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can put it at the other end of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of liquid (especially water or tea, a known liquid driver) before sleeping, which means you have to go up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates opposite to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has expanded with the path of love within Mahayana and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (information energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
God’s yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in system, process and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 soldiers from the Soviet Union’s Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violated the peace agreement in Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagrosbergs of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them for milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Tamgots were usually held in yokels that wandered on hills or other pastures, often led by shepherds who were often children or youths, similar to the better known shepherd. These methods of dilation are still used today.
Trails for wagons were built in England in the 16th century.
Although wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses who drew them allowed them to reach higher speeds and to pull more loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Sanders were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This was to be the practice, but the iron worked more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. The first rails in iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was hiking, people began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, had no habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce the future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases symptomatic treatment, but if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of mankind’s scientific and technological progress, and the problems have worsened because of overpopulation and mankind’s extravagant lifestyle.
After it had been adopted by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap’s printery a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the Farm in Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to its troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 of Dunlap’s broad pages that are known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and remain to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always noticed immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open bottle of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
The term rams is used in the formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient relationships with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasiticize on humans.
Both deer beetles and bedbugs are nesters, adapted to live in its host’s nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to draw up an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents renounce their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is guiding almost all research.
However, it is not alone. To experiment, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle’s view of all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
When the knowledge of Greek diminished, the West found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms of physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited into children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for work is where they just left off.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected with, and supports, a transport system based on private carism.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Virtually everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so much complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the preliminary work cannot be predicted with 100 percent safety.
As well, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow reasonably consistently and can be presented mathematically in general.
In order to better represent traffic flow, a correlation has been established between three main variables: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of facilities along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy easier and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot trap their wings are dragonflies and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchos said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This makes sense because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world’s most water - rich and second - longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times that of the second - largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the rivers of the earth comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon’s main channel is 6,387 km [6,387 km], with thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza’s size and design technology were never surpassed.
The old Egyptians of the new Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors that were well over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, the world’s smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical substances such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of four elements, earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they were switching to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are counted among metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, when newer writing methods have been developed, the pencil has been given a lower status and fewer uses.
Today people write messages on computer screens, and never need to come near a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to produce a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
Much like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. To split the core again, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the hit side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the moon and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. It made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
Theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment it is that makes them do or does not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's needs hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors can appear when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain "the one in the gang."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and keeping people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything that the team has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behaviour often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can influence when their team can meet and this may not be understood by the management locally.
"The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The "Invisible Team" is the management team that all members report to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and inventiveness can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it makes the research area narrower and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
Research within AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in each class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but earlier versions may remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. The students often start their blog experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
As students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
To blog "in addition, students are forced to become more aware of the world around them". The requirement to meet the interest of readers encourages students to be bright and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Suitable use of blogs" can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, and describe their own perspectives on specific questions (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums showing Canada's present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All this and more, Ontario distinguishes with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its own continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a great impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered in the north by the Sahel and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. Just to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole spectrum of slime, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located at the far east near the Rwandan border.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city’s streets, especially in the central areas.
Goma is quite certain, but if you are going to visit outside Goma, you should look at the fighting in northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places."
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat from desert sands.
It was one of the major stops under the Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast with the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border to Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is Crocodile river.
The park covers 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which accommodates different wildlife.
It is one of the biggest sights in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily nature conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus.
The buildings in a row that make up Hong Kong’s silhouette have been likened to a glittering bar chart reinforced by the water in Victoria’s harbor.
To see the best views in Hong Kongs, leave the island and head to the sea side of Kowloon opposite.
The vast majority of the buildings on Hong Kong Island are packed together on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence on the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and stretches 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been accepted on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining stalls of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third are wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axial deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district common bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, go between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between distributors are often full, it is good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are operated by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge, stretching across the Oyapock River and connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 metres, 378 metres long and have two passageways that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
Guaraní was the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadian hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of native tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of India", was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and indigenous indigenous groups."
The Spaniards began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is well known because their polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
This year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the polo courses in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, please turn to Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falklandspundet (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a UK pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the store FIC West.
GBP is usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley often makes it possible to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency can be received; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so change money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bisons, moose, canda deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Furthermore, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid having or cooking food that smells and keeping the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population just below 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamase Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to the location of Auckland between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shores beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most of them offer Maori Myrtle shade.
Tamaki Drives beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St.Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-attended family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta"."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may manage the journey better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are concerned.
"For Australians the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A "short black" is "espresso", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Nevertheless, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to security warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile lies in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveller security and a guarantee that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers to and from the airport, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to review the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of the visitors of the music festival decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things happen you have to come early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music performances on the main stage have stopped, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as walking through ice causes really terrible sounds for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or watches, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and pleasure to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them in the room.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing may occur.
On icy and snowy roads the friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During blizzards it can fall enough snow in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowstorming or by condensation or ice on the vehicle window.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to travels across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"Going safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of hiking either a few hours or for several days."
Paralympics will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted the two summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies due to the corona virus look different, but by the end of March most do not reach as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have started.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yen, with a typical fare around 7 000 yen.
The ironing of damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burn).
There are different ways of purifying water, and some are more effective against specific dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters may vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Harms can destroy food, cause irritation or at worst allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods without tax or other supplements in certain places.
Passengers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often goes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on highways, drive with reason: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
Set speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and their compliance is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other stretches, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbor in the south, Austria.
Bakes with fruit are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are often especially well suited with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannchuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and the continental regions of Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17 000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes spread around the country.
But if it is used without words of determination, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The javanese cuisine, now available everywhere in the island kingdom, offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, where the tasters most used by the javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stiles are support for the rider's feet hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but is stuck with a foot in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders have boots with heels and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that make sure that a stirrup comes off the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's main climb destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world constantly create new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Downhill skiing, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you glide down a snowcapped landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "skiers", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers are dated as far back as 5,000 BC!
Skiing as a sport has been around since at least the 1600s, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as on a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to handle slightly greater distances than when walking – but you only rarely get up at speeds like cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries; under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport checks on a number of occasions.
However, the Schengen area functions much like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone you can generally cross borders without going through passport checks more times.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately, saving both time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other occupations.
Even historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like and used reindeer mostly as drag animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
"Even though it is often used, especially among non-romaniacs, the word ""gypsy"" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and erroneous conceptions of Romani peoples."
If the country you visit is subject to a travel restriction, your travel care insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, for American citizens in the Middle East there may be different circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel council is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often quick, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause injury, serious social disruption or the loss of human life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which may be due to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfire are the types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, skystorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include heavy snowstorms, dizzy weather, ice storms and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of harsh weather affecting their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for anti-environmental education" will probably give the address of a local company."
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here but much more in detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, very first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books about how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender-correcting operations abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for their return.
The will of governments to issue passports without specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The will of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checks have also become considerably more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 period.
Transgender persons who have not undergone an operation should not expect to be able to pass through the X-ray check with integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves that break off at the beach, often at a reef or similar.
The topology under water allows the reflow to be concentrated to a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back towards the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming back is no harder than normal.
Try to aim somewhere where you do not get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been discovered, wait to be saved.
The return shock comes earlier than the cultural shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Passengers who have had an easy time adapting to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When returning from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is just like a storybook.
The background is Sphinxen, who tells a long story.
The scenes appear on the pyramids, and the different pyramids become illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, claim several countries and have the most bases, of which sixteen are active by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater to an active volcano constitutes a spectacular natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt together with the plateau and then return to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain chain, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson massif, with a peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.

The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to join this service.
Travelling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is particularly popular among graduates, which allows them to take a year off before the university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad may actually increase the chances of entering a higher education course in your home country.

Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat of every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the specific Baltic cruises include a longer break in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while you return to and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in its brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of their age and background, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear caused by discomfort to the unknown or by being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent things by air cargo, on some routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it out faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines’ rules do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out with a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, let your business do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point even looking for discounts for seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travellers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of travelling anywhere quickly and comfortably. Companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but which is not recognised by any of the UN Member States.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
It is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge port surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass facade buildings and modern shopping centres are mixed with traditional red tiled roofs, the 18th century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.

Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
Barcelona’s official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, since by law it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other facilities.
Common messages in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disturbances are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a wrong stereotype, the best way to manage in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well behaved). It will make it much easier to get around."
The brusque appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your polite side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is grown with dense forest, mainly with beech, spruce and noble spruce, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly large variety of species, due to the extent of microclimates, different soils and varying height differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and feather are there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts covering their knees, and even have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men must dress in trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but those garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan food, as in similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional accessories available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, and Sie for the pronoun you, are written with a large beginning letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to find out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing a bit more complicated.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies on the basis of the following vowel.

Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their time of greatness was not the kind of problem that they are today, they are usually found in cities or university areas, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the view of cherry blossom, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were used.
In Japan the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been taken up by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter night Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight the congregation then breaks up to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on Galapagos.
Since man’s arrival in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, because the sky is dark more or less 24 hours a day.
Because the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is thus often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be used to.
Costume is the normal business outfit, and colleagues address each other with their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, placing emphasis on joint efforts rather than emphasising the performance of individuals.
