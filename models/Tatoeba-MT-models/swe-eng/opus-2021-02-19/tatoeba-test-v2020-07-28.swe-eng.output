I never trusted them.
I like that dress.
I hate being late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be alone.
What's it worth?
I'm happy to do it.
Unfortunately, it's true.
We'll dress the Christmas tree.
What were you looking at?
The victim was lying face down the carpet.
You're suffocating me.
They married, even though they barely spoke each other’s language.
The toilet is behind the staircase.
I want an ice cream.
Good.
You're the one I love most.
Contact with the number you have chosen is not available.
Tom bounced back.
Welcome!
It wasn't amazing.
Easy catch, easy go.
Has everyone found their mistakes?
Where does your uncle live?
The house was quiet.
I let my feelings cloud my judgment.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
People are sitting on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
She felt we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we crossed the ice.
Why doesn't Tom ever visit us anymore?
That's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you care?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.
My knee hurts when I bend it.
None of this is real.
I lost everything I had.
We have to go right away.
Tom looked down.
It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom's scared.
I got a tablet for Christmas.
She plays hockey on weekends.
You don't talk much.
The red umbrella reminded her of her grandmother.
I remember it the first time.
This is a very time-consuming task.
Tom took off his clothes and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Piglet.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She's taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever arrived or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
Are you gonna be in bed all day, or what?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
He was crying.
Can I see Tom today?
No one wants to.
Who destroyed this?
How do you think I feel?

You should have seen her.
I need to buy stamps.

Try it now.
It didn't really affect us.
Tom voted?
I walk like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're taller than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bore me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better idea.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Sex was invited, the boy included.
Kate's got a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What exactly was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not mad.
There is no doubt who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read The Lord of the Ring Trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She was in favour of gender equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Greetings, guild brother.
Where is the Portuguese Embassy?
My friends didn't betray me during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What about her?
Get dressed fast.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The line to the test cabins ran through the store.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the corner.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man cross the road.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom set me up.
Tom's helping.
One morning, he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the parish.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father is well.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you're gonna have to do without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen’s words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He would have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom in private.
He will fall into temptation.
The TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all of this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated rapidly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I give in secret to my internet addiction.
I never thought it would be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't long gone.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down on the town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked the main lights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here named that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
That's got to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw's broken.
You think she's hot, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't show up before two.
I am.
That's very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom's fast.
Of Finns, about 4.9 per cent are Finnish Swedes, i.e. people with Swedish as their native language.
Unfortunately, Tom turned himself in.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She enclosed a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everyone's dreaming.
Flour is made from wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd come to your senses.
On my return home, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.
Christ is risen!
I need your opinion.
I've had a rough afternoon.
Will you wait for us at the station?
I don't see anybody.
The more you get to know her, the more you'll like her.
Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
