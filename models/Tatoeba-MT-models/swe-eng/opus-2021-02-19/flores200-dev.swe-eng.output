In Berlin, the police estimated that there were 6,500 demonstrators.
Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, some 200 protested outside the offices of some major copyright owners.
Last month, major protests were held in Poland when the country signed the ACTA, which led the Polish Government to decide not to ratify the agreement until further notice.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of joining the ACTA.
Animal Liberation and Royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (RSPCA) once again require the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy of RSPCA New South Wales told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be standard in Australia.
"Monitoring photos would certainly send a strong signal to those who work with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority."
United States Geological Survey's earthquake map did not show any earthquakes in Iceland during the previous week.
The Icelandic weather office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area during the last 48 hours.
The noticeable earthquake activity that led to the phase change took place on 10 March on the northeastern side of the volcano peak kaldera.
Dark clouds, unrelated to volcanic activity, had been observed at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds created potential for confusion as to whether an actual outbreak had occurred.
The Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when it broke and strong winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
The 12 crew members were rescued by helicopter, and the only damage was a broken nose.
The 100 - meter - long ship was on its way to pick up its usual load of fertilizer, and the authorities initially feared that the ship could spill some of its cargo.
The proposed amendment was voted through in both houses in 2011.
A change took place during this legislative session, where the second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives, and then approved in a similar form by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil unions, could possibly open the door to civil unions in the future.
After the preparation, HJR-3 will be re-examined by the next elected legislature, either in 2015 or 2016 to keep the process active.
Vautier's achievements in addition to directing include a hunger strike in 1973 against what he considered to be political censorship.
His activism went back to when he was 15 when he joined the French resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in a book in 1998.
In the 1960s, he went back to Algeria, which has recently gained independence to teach film publishing.
The Japanese judo artist Hitoshi Saito, who has won two Olympic gold medals, has died 54 years old.
Cause of death was reported as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to his status as Olympic champion and world champion, Saito was at the time of his death also chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation Training Committee.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the anniversary of the couple who married last year.
A formal celebration of the anniversary was scheduled for a later occasion, according to the authorities.
The couple had married in Texas a year earlier and came to Buffalo to celebrate with family and friends.
The 30 - year - old man, born in Buffalo, was one of the four who was killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher at Modern Education and King's Glory who claimed to have 9,000 students at the top of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents considered gross, and reportedly used profanity during classes.
Modern Education accused him of having printed large ads on buses without permission and lied by saying that he was the foremost English supervisor.
He has also previously been charged with copyright infringement but was not prosecuted.
"A former student said he used slang in class, taught dating skills through tags, and was just like the students' friend."
Over the last three decades, China has developed a market economy, although it is officially still a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown by 90 times.
Last year China exported for the first time more cars than Germany and surpassed the US as the largest market for this industry.
China's GDP may be higher than that of the United States within two decades.
Hurricane Danielle, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic Hurricane season, has been formed in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which is about 3,000 miles [3,000 km] from Miami, Florida, has a peak wind of 40 miles per hour [64 km/h].
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will increase in strength to a hurricane by Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in Croatian capital Zagreb, became famous when he played for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time on the team he scored 403 goals on 468 occasions.
No one has ever played more games or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted to Partizan's best player of all time.
The celebration began with a special performance by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then the whirling dervics took the stage.
The Turkish divan Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"To conclude, the dance group Fire of Anatolia from Turkey performed the performance "Troja"."
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died from a crash on Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up yard Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was then hit by his competitor Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately taken care of by medical personnel on site and transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat survived the accident unharmed.
"As for the global economic situation, Zapatero went on to say that "the financial system is part of the economy, a crucial part."
We have a financial crisis that has lasted for a year, where the last two months have been the most acute, and I think the financial markets are now beginning to recover."
Last week, Naked News announced a dramatic increase in its international language mandate for news reporting, with three new broadcasts.
The global organization is already reporting in English and Japanese, and is now also launching Spanish, Italian and Korean TV, web and mobile applications.
"Happyly nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene when people tried to break windows to get out."
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the windows was finally crushed and they began to come out the window," said Franciszek Kowal."
Stars emit light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms merge to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on building a reactor that can create energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before we see ready-made, useful fusion reactors.
The steel pin floats on top of the water due to the surface tension.
Surface tension occurs when water molecules at the surface of the water are attracted more strongly to each other than to the molecules in the air above them.
"The water molecules form an invisible "skin" on the surface of the water, causing things like the needle to flow on top of the water."
The skate on a modern skate has a double edge with a concave hollowing between them. The two edges enable a better grip on the ice, even when tilted.
When the underside of the rail is slightly bent, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also bent when the rail is tilted to one side or the other.
This makes the skater turn. If the skaters lean to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skaters lean to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they had to get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
They do this by sending away a photo, which is a small particle of light.
"Researchers call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a light photon, and light is a type of radiation."
The next picture shows how the atoms emit photons. In reality the photons are of course much smaller than the ones in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the elements of an atom!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament finally burns off and the bulb ceases to function.
It is important to be careful when changing the light bulb.
First, the switch for the lamp fixture must be switched off or the cord must be disconnected.
This is because electricity flows to the base where the metallic part of the bulb is located and can give you a strong shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb when it is partially inserted in the base.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood emanates from the heart of tubes called arteries and returns to the heart of tubes called veins. The narrowest tubes are called capillaries.
A ticeratop’s teeth could have crushed not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cycads, which is a kind of plant that was common under Krita.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, prickly leaves.
A Triceratops could have used his strong beak to pull the leaves off before it ate the tree trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly toxic and that it is unlikely that any dinosaur will eat them, although today’s sloths and other animals like parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How would Io's gravity affect me? If you stood on Io's surface, you'd weigh less than you do on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So of course gravity draws less in you.
The sun has no crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The whole sun is composed of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner the longer you get from the sun's core.
"The last part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means "lightball."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to see that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.
Phases arise because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) facing the sun is illuminated. Venus phases supported Copernicus’ theory that the planets are moving around the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks saw a transit of Venus.
England experienced a long period of peace after the conquest of the Dane Law.
In 991, however, Ethelred was met by a Viking fleet larger than any other since Guthrum's century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to regain his country from Danish domination.
After suffering setbacks in the beginning, Ethelred managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to win his kingdom with mixed successes.
Hangul is the only deliberately invented alphabet in everyday use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king during the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most respected.
"From the beginning he gave the Hangeul alphabet the name Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the right sounds for the enlightenment of the people."
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came about. One of them is about how an Aryan migration from the west and into India brought the language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit gradually disappeared due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that has given rise to many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the basis for European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the battle for France was over, Germany began preparing for the invasion of the island of Britain.
"Germany used the code name "Operation Sea Lions" for the attack. Most of the British army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it was evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak."
"But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet sent over the English Channel."
However, few Royal Navy ships were based near likely invasion routes because the admirals were afraid they would be lowered by German air attacks.
"Let us begin with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly Germany's and Japan's "little brother"."
They had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, even though they had built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy was mainly looking for African countries. To conquer these, a stepping stone was needed for the Italian troops so that they could sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For that, they had to rid themselves of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition, Italy’s warships would do nothing.
Japan was an island nation, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long time.
Submarines were used during World Wars I and II. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mostly in superwater mode, but as the radar developed and became more accurate, the submarines were forced below the surface to avoid being detected.
The Germans had submarines that they were very good at steering and handling.
Because of its success with submarines, Germany was not allowed to have many of them after the war.
"Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King Tut" or "Boy King," is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times."
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in ancient times and was not registered in most ancient royal lists.
But the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many older graves were plundered, this tomb was left virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamon have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of wheels with spokes made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better equipped to drive faster than soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbow could penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers. About 1000 B.C., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army fighting on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the horses only backs.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous person from this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliaden and the Odyssey.
Sofokles and Aristophanes are still popular scriptwriters and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is mathematician Pythagoras who is best known for his famous movement about the relationship between the sides of right-angled triangles.
There are different estimates for how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether similar dialects are taken into account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but the written language differs; in everyday conversations, speakers in both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century Germany had a great cultural influence in northern Estonia.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so they constructed the Estonian writing language.
"It was based on the German alphabet and a letter "Õ/õ" was added."
In time, many words borrowed from German were merged. This was the beginning of the enlightenment.
After finishing school, the heir to the throne would traditionally go directly into the military.
However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, and received a grade of 2:2 (a lower second grade grade).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to graduate from university.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Romania in the Balkan Peninsula) covers 3% of the country.
The Turkish territory is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, with about a rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are counted in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9.174 sq mi) are counted in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the 37th largest in the world and is as large as France (motherland) and Britain together.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Some of the present Belgium belonged to Luxembourg earlier but became Belgian after the Belgian revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but was occupied both in World War I and World War II by Germany.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organisation known today as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a fortruin and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in Phondey village).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951 a fire left only some of Drukgyal Dzong’s remains, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected, and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational sights.
During the 18th century, Cambodia found itself tucked in between two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
Thailand invaded Cambodia several times during the 17th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those with jobs work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans working do so in the service sector, almost one quarter work in industry and one fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, and the country is a net exporter, although only one per cent work in the oil industry.
Early in the country’s independence, experts from Singapore’s botanical garden helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
The orchid hybrid Vantaa Miss Joaquim was named the national flower of the country in 1981.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million grass - eaters move from the northern hills to the southern plains for the sake of rain and cross the Mara River.
And then back to the northern part through the west, when they again cross the Mara River, after the rains that come about in April.
The Serengeti region consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve and Maswa Wildlife Reserve in Tanzania and Maasai Mara Nature Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires both conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools to learn in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to reconsider your image of what media production is and learn to think in new ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project are connected, but also understandable as separate units.
The disadvantage of zoom lens is that the focal length complexity and the number of lens elements required to achieve a focal length range is much greater than for fixed focal length lenses.
This is becoming an increasingly minor problem when lens manufacturers achieve higher standards of lens production.
This has enabled zoom lenses to provide images of a quality comparable to that achieved by fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lens is that the largest aperture (and shutter speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use in low light without flash.
One of the most common problems when converting movies to DVD format is overscanning.
Most televisions are designed to satisfy the general public.
For this reason, everything you see on the TV has cut margins, tops, bottoms and pages.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called overscan.
Unfortunately, the edges will likely also be cropped when you make a DVD, and subtitles at the bottom of the image may then partially disappear.
The traditional medieval castle has long tickled the imagination and produced images of tower games, banquets and Arthuric chivalry.
Even when standing among ruins that are thousands of are old, it is easy to imagine sounds and smells from ancient battles, you can almost hear hooves simmering on the cobblestones and smell the fear of the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a reinforced house than a genuine castle, which is typical of the period.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls could not have resisted a determined attack for very long.
In the 1480s, when construction began by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and the defense was needed only against small wandering band.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations should work to prevent a nation from gaining too much power and therefore national governments often changed alliance to maintain balance.
The Spanish succession war was the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, when European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years War would be the last war that was designated a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. in a fire by Herostratos.
According to the account, his motivation was fame at all costs. The furious Ephesians announced that Herostrato’s name would never be registered.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, as it is called today. The temple was destroyed the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly. Also, try not to make many excess movements with your fingers.
This way you tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume as on a piano.
With an accordion you use the bellows with more pressure or higher speed to get higher volume.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of, a supreme reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/gudom or deities.
Supporters follow certain ways of living, or customs designed to promote these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious faith and worship by its emphasis on the strictly personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially that of a peaceful, insightful, blessed, or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century through a sectarian division into Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion separate from Hinduism, even though they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
"Sikher calls his religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi "the way of the guru." The guru is fundamental in all Indian religions, but for Sikhism it is so important that it forms the core of the Sikh faith."
Religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469 - 1539), followed by nine more gurus in succession.
But in June 1956 Khrushchev’s promises were put to the test when rebellion in Poland, where workers protested against lack of food and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushjov eventually sent in tanks to restore order, he gave way to certain economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as new prime minister.
Indus culture was a Bronze Age civilization on the northwestern Indian subcontinent, covering most of today's Pakistan as well as certain regions of north-western India and north-eastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the valley of the Indu River, from which it also got its name.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization also existed around the now dried-out Sarasvati River, the more appropriate name of Indus-Sarasvati civilization should be used, while some call it Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first of its places to be excavated in the 1920s.
The military character of the Roman Empire facilitated the development of medical progress.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical corps for use after battles.
Surgeons knew of a number of sedatives, including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from bleat seeds.
They became skilled at amputations to rescue patients from gangrene as well as pressure dressings and arterial clamps to stop blood flow.
For centuries the Roman Empire had great success in the medical field and created much of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami with the limitation that only one fold may be made at a time, more complicated folds such as backward folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple placements.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced bayers or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes at a fairly early age, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority where the stereotype is that they do not do well at school tend not to perform well at school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million user profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
There are positive aspects to these websites, such as being able to easily create a classida that can contain blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by entering only a URL, making it easy to remember and easy to enter for students who may have problems using the keyboard or spelling.
It can be adapted to be more easy to read and with as much or as little color as desired.
"ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder)" is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms includes impulsivity, attention problems, and hyperactivity or excess energy."
"It's not learning difficulties, it's a learning disorder; it's 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe as many as 2 million American children."
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like such as playing games or watching their cartoon favorite programs or writing sentences without punctuation.
"These children tend to have a lot of problems, because they ""are engaged in risky behavior, get into fights and defy authorities"" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods."
ADD affects the relationship with other children because they cannot understand why they act as they do, spells as they do, or that they are at a different maturity level.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn changed in the above way, the speed at which knowledge was acquired also changed.
The procedure for collecting information was different. The pressure was no longer on individual recalls, but the focus shifted more to the possibility of recalling text.
Essentially, the renaissance meant a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use their hands to get through, to carry body weight, or swing through trees.
The chimpanzee’s hand and foot are about the same size, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight when the monkey is walking on the knuckles.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanges.
Fossil handbones that are two to three million years old reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from movement to manipulation.
Some feel that it can be very exhausting to experience many induced lucid dreams too often.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the consequence of clear dreams extending the time between REM states.
With fewer REM episodes per night, this condition is reached where you experience actual sleep and your body rarely recovers enough to become a problem.
This is as exhausting as if you were to wake up every 20 or 30 minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times your brain tries to clear dreams per night.
The Italians in North Africa were not doing well right from the start. Within a week of Italy’s declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the 11th British Hussars had taken control of Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian 10th Army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and the likely successor to Mussolini, was killed by a gunfire during landing in Tobruk.
The modern fencing sport is practiced at many different levels, from university students to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is played primarily in a duel format, a fencer duel with another.
Golf is a sport where players use clubs to hit balls into holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round where players usually start on the first hole on the track and end on the eighteenth.
Wins do the player who needs the minimum number of strokes, or swings with the club, to complete the course.
The game is played on grass and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and called green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travellers: recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their everyday lives to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are among the most common places that tourists visit for relaxation purposes.
If someone visits a certain place to get to know its history and culture, that kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various sights in a particular country or so they can simply choose to focus on just one area.
The colonists who saw this activity had also requested reinforcements.
Troops that reinforced the front lines included the 1st and 3rd regiments from New Hampshire with 200 men, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both then became generals).
Stark's men posted themselves along the fence at the northern side of the colonists' position.
When the low tide opened a glip along the Mystic River along the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the beat with a short stone wall toward the northern end at the water’s edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stick about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one give fire until the Trimgogs passed it.
The American plan was based on coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was about to launch a sham attack on the British garrison at Bordentown in order to block any support troops.
General James Ewing would take a militia of 700 across the river at Trenton Ferry, take the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent all enemy troops from escaping.
The main strike force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
With the change from a quarter to half a mile of running, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first - class runner at a distance of half a mile, a man who can handle it in under two minutes, will have to cope with quite a lot of speed, but endurance must be considered at all costs.
Some cross-country running during the winter, combined with upper body strength training, is the best preparation for the running season.
Correct nutrition habits alone cannot generate elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young athletes.
A healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits and knowledge of the various aspects of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and gain greater enjoyment from their sport.
Medium-range running is a relatively cheap sport, but there are many misconceptions about the small amount of equipment required to participate.
Equipment can be purchased if necessary, but most products have little or no impact on performance.
Although it does not bring any real benefits, athletes may feel that they like a product more.
The atom can be seen as one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex unit which according to a simplified Bohr model consists of a central core surrounded by electrons, something similar to planets orbiting the sun - see figure 1.1.
The core consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electrical charge.
Before examining the victim, you must first check the surroundings to ensure your own safety.
You must note the victim's position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and disaster were an indirect causal relationship between pain and disability in individuals suffering from lumbar pain.
It only mentioned the effects of black painting in weekly meetings, not the effects of depression and fear.
Those involved in regular activity required more support in the negative experience of pain, which characterized the differences between chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs or eyes of the visual system.
Eyes are constructed in many different ways, with different complexity depending on what the organism requires.
The different structures have different capacities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have varying sharpness levels. They also require different processing methods to interpret the input and different numbers to function optimally.
‘population’ means a collection of organisms within a given species within a given geographical area;
When all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic characteristic, they are called monomorphic.
When the individuals exhibit several variants of a specific characteristic, they are called polymorphic.
Colonies of wandering ants march and build nests in different phases as well.
In the nomadic phase, the wandering ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase when available food decreases. During this phase, the colony creates temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic ravages or marches lasts about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella" which means "small room" and it was originally coined by a microscopeist who observed the structure of cork."
The cell is the base unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
"Cellers are so basic and critical for the study of life that they are often called "the building blocks of life."
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep the blood flow running without interference.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body, helping to keep it safe from any threats.
Tromber affects a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes pull up trees with roots, rip boards from buildings, and throw cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of the tornadoes last longer than three hours.
These monster storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/h).
People have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 1500s.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make remote objects appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and it is the nature of cooperation that, when the majority benefits, there is always more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly
In the long term, most people will hopefully realise that their best option is to work with others.
Many dream of the day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people marvel at what is out there, some believe that aliens or other lives can live on another planet.
"But if this ever happens, it probably won't happen for a very long time. The stars are so scattered that there are trillion kilometers between stars that are ""neighbours""."
Perhaps one day your grandchildren ’ children look out over a strange world and ponder over their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells, they eat things, they melt the food inside, most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (but not even all animals; jellyfish, for example, have no brain).
There are animals all over the earth digging in the ground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the air.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit in any living (object) organism.
The word cell originates from the Latin cella which means small room.
If you look at living creatures in a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small corked squares with a microscope.
He was the first human to observe dead cells.
Elements and chemical compounds can shift from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in gaseous form still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is more compact but it is still the same molecules.
Water is another example. The association water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that is all around us, and affects everything we do, yet it is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific researchers for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events running from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of occasions.
You can measure the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclic event. A cyclic event is something that happens regularly over and over again.
Today computers are used to edit images and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be created on computers, and these types of animations are increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded with sophisticated computers that process and mix sound.
Long during the nineteenth and nineteenth centuries it was believed that New Zealand's first inhabitants were the Maori, who hunted giant birds called Moa birds.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori migrated from Polynesia into a large fleet and took New Zealand from Moriori where they established an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maoris from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, and developed their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham Islands and these were Maoris who moved from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were some minor clashes and in the end Moriori was exterminated.
People involved for decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
By listening to individuals' personal stories about themselves, their family and their organization, we have gained valuable insights into local history and about the people who have positively or negatively affected the organization's culture.
Although knowledge of one’s history is not the same as cultural insight, it at least gives people a sense of where they belong in the organization’s history.
While individuals and participants as a whole assess their success and become aware of failures, they and all other participants discover the organization's values, missions and driving forces at a deeper level.
In this case it was helpful to remember past entrepreneurship and the successes that followed, so that people would be open to change and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced the fear of change, while giving a positive attitude to future changes.
Convergence of thinking is problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or areas to find a solution.
This approach focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as identifying facts, reapplying existing techniques and collecting information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer; you only think of two answers, namely right or wrong.
This way of thinking is associated with certain knowledge or standard routines.
People with this way of thinking have logical thinking, can memorize patterns, solve problems, and work with scientific studies.
Humans are superior to other species in reading the thoughts of others.
This means that we are capable of predicting what other people experience, mean, believe, know or desire.
Among these abilities, it is important to understand the intent of others, which allows us to determine any ambiguities in physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you may take it for granted that he is trying to steal a car belonging to someone else.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car he was trying to break into.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
In this resonance magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
In 1970 the doctor and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world to be issued within MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "whole body"-MR camera, which he called "Indomitable."
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction towards others.
It gives students the opportunity to work at their own pace and guide the speed of the instructive information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions on the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and www means that students have access to information at all times.
Students can also submit questions to supervisors at any time of the day and expect reasonably quick answers, instead of waiting for the next personal meeting.
The postmodern pedagogical approach offers freedom from absolute solutions. There is not a perfect learning method.
There is actually not a good thing to learn. Learning is done in the experience between the student and the presented knowledge.
Our current experience with all do-it-yourself and information-presenting, learning-based TV shows illustrates this point.
Many watch a TV program that informs us of a process or experience that we will never participate in or apply the acquired knowledge.
We will never investigate a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate ancient ruins, or rebuild the neighbor's house.
Thanks to underwater fibre optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected where 93% of the population have access to the internet.
The hotel or hosts (if you live in a guest house or a private home) probably have wifi or a PC connected to the internet and all settlements have an internet café or any place with public wifi.
"As mentioned above, although the word "Eskimo" remains acceptable in the United States, it is regarded as derogatory by many non-American Arctic peoples, especially in Canada."
Although you may hear the word used by native Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
Greenland's indigenous people call themselves Inuiter in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), Grönländare, in Greenland.
"Crime, and hostility towards foreigners in general, practically doesn't exist in Greenland, nor are there any ""ruffy neighbourhoods"" in the cities."
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger that the unprepared encounters.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (given that it gets colder the further north you go), it is important to bring enough warm clothes.
The very long days of summer can lead to problems getting enough sleep and associated health problems.
During the summer, also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes. Although they do not spread any diseases, they can be annoying.
Although San Francisco’s economy is linked to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, the economy is diverse.
The main labour market sectors are professional services, public authorities, financial services, trade and tourism.
Its frequent portrayal in music, movies, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known all over the world.
San Francisco has developed an extensive tourism infrastructure with lots of hotels, restaurants, and first-class facilities for gatherings.
San Francisco is also one of the country's best places for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many American families.
"The "typical" visit involves flying to Orlando's international airport, going to a Disney hotel on site, spending about a week without leaving Disney's area, and returning home."
"There are an infinite number of variations, but this is what most people mean when they talk about going to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partly used park-hopper tickets for several days.
Although it is very common, Disney prohibits it: the tickets may not be transferred.
Each campsite under the edge of the Grand Canyon requires a so-called land permit.
The permits are limited to protect the canyon, and released on the first day of the month, four months before the start month.
Thus, a wilderness state with any start date in May will be available on 1 January.
The location on the most popular areas, such as Bright Angel Campground next to Phantom Ranch, is usually filled by requests received on the first day they open for booking.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for those who request to enter on foot, available on a first come, first served basis.
Getting into southern Africa by car is a fantastic way to see the beauty of the entire area and get to places beyond the usual tourist routes.
This can be done with a normal car with careful planning but four-wheel drive is highly recommended and many places can only be reached by a car with four-wheel drive and high wheel base.
Remember when you plan that even if South Africa is stable, not all its neighbours are.
The requirements and costs of a visa vary from country to country and are affected by which country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws that set requirements on which units must be in the car for emergencies.
The city of Victoria Falls is located in western Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border with Livingstone, Zambia and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, and these are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers sufficient opportunities for longer stays for both adventure seekers and those on sightseeing.
During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water is larger and the falls become more dramatic.
You will certainly get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the tracks winding close to the falls.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the waters are as enormous as your view of the actual Niagara Falls is obscured - by all the water!
The tomb of Tutanchamon (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the graves in the valley, the site of Howard Carter's discovery of the almost intact royal burial of the young king in 1922.
Compared to most of the other royal tombs, the tomb of Tutankhamon is hardly worth visiting, since it is much smaller and has limited adornment.
Anyone who wants to see evidence of the damage caused to the mummy when trying to move it from the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The outstanding treasures in the tomb are no longer there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with a short amount of time do best to spend time somewhere else.
Phnum kraôm, 12 km southwest of Siem reap. This temple at the top of the hill was built in the late 800s, under King Yasovarman.
The eerie atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap make the climb to the hill worth the trouble.
A visit to the place can easily be combined with a boat ride on the lake.
The Angkor Pass is needed to enter the temple, so do not forget to bring your passport when you make it to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is Israel’s capital and largest city, although most countries and the United Nations do not recognize Israel’s capital.
The ancient city of Judea has a fascinating history that stretches back thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and acts as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Jerusalem is one of the most important tourist destinations in Israel because of the religious importance of the city, and especially thanks to the many places in the Old Town.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, along with lively and crowded shopping centers, cafés and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation before arriving in Ecuador via international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must be approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet specific requirements.
These requirements are designed to create a regulated migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens with an American green card should turn to an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least six months after your travel dates. A ticket for a return or further journey is needed to prove how long you will stay.
The tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or just with a friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six for a cheaper price per person.
However, there is nothing you should have to worry about, as tourists are often moved around to fill the cars.
Actually, it seems more like a way to trick people into thinking they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, which is often seen in the background of many photos of the ruins.
It looks a little scary from the bottom, and it is a steep and difficult climb, with most people in reasonably good condition should be able to do it in about 45 minutes.
Stairs are laid along most of the path and in the steeper sections steel cables are used as railings.
So you can expect to get short of breath, and take it easy in the steeper parts, especially when it is wet, because it can quickly become dangerous.
Near the top is a small cavities that you have to pass, it is quite low and narrow to squeeze through.
The places and wildlife of the Galápagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail at Galapagos – varying in size between 8 and 100 passengers.
Most people book their seats long in advance (because the boats are often full during high season).
Make sure you book through a travel agency that specializes in Galapagos, with good knowledge of many different types of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inka rule while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche) inhabited the central and southern parts of Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent groups of American indigenous peoples, who were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the middle of the Napoleonic War which left Spain without a functioning central government for a few years), the decisive victory over the Spaniards was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country extending to the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is also home to the oldest European city in America, today part of Santo Domingo.
The island was inhabited from the beginning by the Tainos and the Caribians. The Caribbeans were a group of people who spoke arawak and arrived on the island about 10,000 B.C.E.
Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, the number of the Taino population had been greatly reduced by the Spanish conquerors.
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed some 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was built as atrium for a 17th century monastery, of which Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now works as a central square and there are always things that happen, day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden and in afternoons and evenings there are often free concerts from the gazebo in the middle.
Callejon del Beso (Kyssens alley). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters are home to an old love legend.
Some kids can tell you the story for a few bucks.
Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend tour offering paddling, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just outside Vancouver and is easily reached by water taxi according to schedule, departing from Granville Island in central Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities it is a must to hike The sea-to-sky corridor.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but well known due to the winter Olympics 2010.
In winter, enjoy the best skiing in North America, and in summer try real mountain biking.
Permission must be booked in advance. You must have a permit to stay overnight on Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station that in addition to camping offers overnight stays in the dormitory and warm meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer only camping without dining.
It is possible to secure park permits directly from the park guard station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The Park Service (MINAE) does not issue parking permits more than one month before expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service at a fee of $30, or $10 for a one-day pass; more information is available on their Corcovado page.
Cook Islands is an island country freely associated with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands that spreads over 2.2 million square kilometers of sea.
"With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes called "Hawaii down below."
Although it is less reminiscent of some older visitors of Hawaii before the state was formed without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but consist of 15 different islands. The largest are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
To offer luxurious bed & breakfasts has today been elevated to a kind of art form in I-countries.
In the upper price category, hostels of course compete mainly with two important things: beds and breakfast.
Hence, at the finest of such facilities one can probably find the most luxurious bedclothes, perhaps a handmade blanket or an antique bed.
Breakfast may contain seasonal delights from the region or the host's special dish.
The place can be a historic old building with antique furniture, well maintained plot and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and going away on a long journey has an inherent appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already used to driving your car and know its limitations.
pitching tents on private land or in cities of all sizes can easily attract unwanted attention.
In conclusion, your own car is a very good way to travel around, but that in itself does not mean the same as camping.
Camping by car is possible if you have a minibus, city jeep, then or station wagon with seats that can be folded down.
Some hotels dates back to the golden era with steam railways and ocean steamers; before World War II, during the 1800s or early 1900s.
It was at these hotels the rich and the famous lived at that time, and often had big dinners and nightlife.
The old-fashioned seizures, the lack of the latest amenities, and a particular elegant old age are also part of their character.
Since they are usually privately owned, they sometimes accommodate visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A well-to-do traveler might consider a round-the-world trip with breaks at many of these hotels.
A hospitality network is an organization that conveys contact between travelers and residents of the cities to be visited.
Joining such a network usually only requires filling in an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verification.
Then a list of available hosts is given, either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but had nowhere to stay.
He e-mailed students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers of free accommodation.
Hostels are primarily aimed at young people – a typical guest is in her 20s – but you can often find older travellers there as well.
Families with children are an unusual sight, but in some hostels they have the opportunity to stay in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the Olympic Winter Games 2022, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the ice branches.
Other ski events take place in the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual festival starting from late November to mid-May, which varies depending on each temple's annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple’s anniversary or present divinity’s birthday or any other major event in connection with the temple.
Kerala temple festivals are very interesting to see, with regular processions of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities.
A world exhibition (also called World Exposition or Expo only) is a major international festival of art and science.
Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to showcase issues related to the world or their country's culture and history.
International garden exhibitions are specialized events that show flowers, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although in theory they can be organised annually (as long as they are in different countries), this is not happening in practice.
These events normally last anywhere between three and six months and are held at places of at least 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats used over the years. Usually 35 mm film (36 times 24 mm negative) is the most common.
It can usually be refilled quite easily if it runs out and provides a resolution equivalent to approximately a modern system camera.
Some medium-size film cameras use a format of 6 x 6 cm, more specifically a negative of 56 x 56 mm.
This gives almost four times better resolution than a 35 mm negative (3 136 mm2 compared to 864).
Wild animals are among the most challenging subjects for a photographer and require a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but as with photography generally, an image is worth a thousand words.
Shooting wild animals often requires a long telephoto lens, but things like a flock of birds or a small animal need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about photography for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive. The surroundings can be chilly, hot, or otherwise inhospitable.
More than 5,000 different languages are spoken worldwide, of which more than twenty are spoken by 50 million or more people.
In addition, written words are often easier to understand than spoken words; this is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in an understandable way.
In many entire nations you are fluent in English and in even more you can expect limited knowledge - especially among younger people.
Imagine a corduroy, a boston, a Jamaican, and a Southney who sits at a table and eats dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
They entertain each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their distinctive dialects and local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. Without cooking opportunities, however, the choices are limited to ready-to-eat food.
Food stores are expanding their range of ready - made foods, some even having a microwave or something like that to warm the food.
In some countries or types of shops there is at least one restaurant on site, often a rather informal one with affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and your insurance company’s contact details and carry them with you.
In order to obtain advice/authorisations or claim, they must present the insurance company's email address and international telephone number.
"Have an extra copy in your luggage and online (e-mail to yourself as attached file, or save in the ""cloud"""."
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, be sure to store a copy of its memory or hard drive (available without internet).
Also provide copies of policy documents/contact information to travel companions and family and friends at home who are willing to help.
Mooses are normally not aggressive but defend themselves if they experience a threat.
When people do not see moose as potentially dangerous, they can get too close and put themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to know your limit.
Long-term health problems that can arise from excessive drinking include liver disease and even blindness and death.
Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous impurities such as methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Spectacles can be cheaper abroad, especially in long-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Consider examining the eyes at home, especially if the insurance covers it, and bring the recipe to get it filed elsewhere.
Exclusive brand arches available in such areas may have two problems; some may be plagiarism and genuine imported may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded raw materials and you can probably find many types in your home region.
Nevertheless, there are many special ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning is about being at the bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines parts from swimming, climbing and jumping - but requires relatively little training or good physical shape to get started (compared to e.g. mountain climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves hiking in nature, often along hiking trails.
Day hikes include distances of less than one mile up to longer distances that can be completed in one day.
A day trip along a light track does not require much preparation and any average well-trained person can enjoy them.
Families with young children may need to prepare more, but a day outdoors is easy to implement even with small children and preschool children.
Internationally, there are almost 200 organisations for running tours. Most of them operate independently.
"Global Running Tours' successor, Go Running Tours, connects dozens of providers of so-called "sight running" on four continents."
"With roots in Barcelona's "Running Tours Barcelona" and Copenhagen's "Running Copenhagen" it was quickly expanded with "Running Tours Prague" based in Prague and other cities."
There are many things that you need to think about before and during that you travel somewhere.
"When you travel, don't expect things to be like "at home." Conduct, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, norms, language, and so on will differ in some way from where you live."
This is something you need to keep in mind to avoid disappointment or even disgust at local habits.
Travel agencies have been around since the 1800s. A travel agency is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond a traveller’s previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although many agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings, many agencies specialise in specific types of travel, budget ranges or destinations.
It may be better to use an agency that often book similar trips as yours.
Take a look at which trips the agent markets, whether they are on a website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world in a cheap way, either as a necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are many ways to do it.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: Either you work while traveling, or you try to limit your expenses. This article is focused on the latter.
"For those who gladly sacrifice convenience, time and predictability to reduce expenditure to virtually zero, see ""travel on minimal budget""."
The advice assumes that travellers do not steal, trespass, participate in the illegal market, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own profit.
Border control is usually the first stop after disembarking from a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On certain trains crossing borders, checks are made while the train is in motion, and then you should have a valid ID document when you get on.
On night trains, a pass may be collected by the conductor so that you do not need to have your sleep interrupted.
Registration is another requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and the address where you live with the local authorities.
This may require a form to be filled in with the local police or a visit to the immigration authority.
In many countries with such a law, local hotel registration is handled (make sure to ask).
In other cases you only need to register if you rent rooms outside the tourist accommodation. However, this makes the law very dunkling, so find out how it is in advance.
Architecture is about the design and construction of buildings. Architecture in one place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to see and the view from a tall building or a smartly placed window can be a very beautiful sight.
Architecture considerably overlaps with other areas, including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design and landscape design.
Many villages are far away, so there is no real nightlife unless you go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
Almost all of the above-mentioned casinos, however, serve drinks and several of them also bring in famous names as entertainment (mainly large ones from Albuquerques and Santa Fe’s immediate surroundings).
Watch out: small town bars here are not always good places to stay for visitors from outside.
First, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near bars in small cities.
Unwanted murals or graffiti are called graffiti.
Although it is far from a modern phenomenon, most probably associate it with youths who vandalize public and private property with spray paint.
"Nowadays, however, there are established graffiti artists, graffiti establishments and "legal" walls. In these contexts, graffiti paintings often resemble works of art rather than illegible tags."
Bumerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back to your hand, make sure you have a good boomerang that returns.
Most boomerangs in Australia do not actually return. As a beginner, it is best not to throw in windy
Hangi-cooked food is cooked in a warm pit in the ground.
The pit is heated either with hot stones from a fire or by the geothermal heat that heats the ground naturally in some places.
Hangin is often used to cook a traditional kind of barbecue dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other types of hangi can be tasted in Christchurch and Wellington.
MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and not so crowded, but a bit more expensive, but still cheaper than regular subway tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro cars; the MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train nearest Cape Town.
Carrying to others - Never leave your bags out of sight, especially when crossing international borders.
You could end up being used as a drug bearer without your knowledge, which could put you in a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in a row, as drug dogs can be used at any time without warning.
Some countries have very severe penalties even for first-time offenders, which may include prison sentences of more than ten years or the death penalty.
Luggage left unattended is a target for thieves and can also be noticed by authorities who are concerned about bomb threats.
If you are at home, the odds are very high that you are already immune to them due to constant exposure to the local bacteria.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, it is much more likely that you will encounter problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria can also grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the plagues of Delhi-mage, Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, bowel problems in warmer climates are quite common and in most cases noticeably irritating, but not directly dangerous.
If you travel in a developing country for the first time – or in a new part of the world – do not underestimate the potential cultural crash.
Many experienced travelers have been taken in by the new with travel in developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly be beneficial.
Consider, especially in your first days, turning on large with hotels, food and service with Western style and quality, to make it easier to acclimatize yourself.
Do not sleep on a mattress or cushion on the ground in areas where you do not know the local wildlife.
If you want to camp out, bring a cot or hammock to stay away from snakes, scorpions, and the like.
Fill your home with tasty coffee in the morning and some soothing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you are on the hemester you have time to take care of yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew something special.
If you feel more adventurous you can take the opportunity to squeeze juice or mix smoothies:
perhaps you will discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you are back in your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a rich drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you do not visit often.
For those who do not know medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, a bacterium, a fungus or other parasites.
An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted by being close to an infected person.
Many governments require that incoming visitors or outgoing residents of their countries are vaccinated for a variety of diseases.
These requirements may often differ according to which countries a traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the strong things about Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it has an abundance of high-quality options for families.
Residents who have moved in from other areas often refer to the area’s family friendliness as the main reason why they moved there and visitors often experience the city as easy to enjoy with children.
Over the last 20 years, the number of child-friendly choices in Charlotte's northern central parts has increased exponentially.
Taxis are not usually used by families in Charlotte, although they can be used under certain circumstances.
A charge is charged for more than 2 passengers, so this option may be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical health, can only take place in summer Nov–Feb and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer on about four dozen bases, mainly in those areas; a small number stay over winter.
Antarctica inland is a desolate plateau covered with 2-3 km thick ice.
Single specialist tours go inland via the air for mountain climbing or to reach the pole where there is a large base.
The South Pole Traverse main route is a 1600 km long road from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It is compressed snow with cracks, filled and marked with flags. You can only travel there with special tractors, trailers with fuels and supplies.
These are not very flinky so the track has to take a long turn around the Trans-Arctic mountains to get up on the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is slippery roads, sidewalks and especially steps.
As a minimum, you need shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes rarely grip well enough on ice and snow; even some winter shoes may be deficient.
The pattern shall be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material shall be sufficiently soft in cold temperatures.
Some boots have studs and there is additional equipment with studs in slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and soles.
Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often used to improve the grip of the road by spreading it on roads or paths.
The avalanches are not abnormal; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess will fall down like avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky so it needs some trigger to get it down, and snow that comes down can in itself become a trigger for the rest.
Sometimes the original triggering event is that the sun warms the snow, sometimes more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a person.
A tornado is a spinning column with very low air pressure that sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
They generate high winds (often 160-320 km/h) and can lift heavy objects into the air and move them when the tornado moves.
"They begin as funnels that descend from storm clouds and become "tornados" when they come down to the ground."
Connecting to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are superior web proxy servers for several reasons: They redirect all Internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer a higher bandwidth and higher quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
"The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this and claim that it is to "prevent piracy"."
In fact, regional codes have no effect whatsoever on illegal copying; a bit-by-bit copy of a disc works perfectly well on all devices on which the original can be played.
The actual aim is to give these companies more control over their markets; it is about getting the money to roll.
Since the calls are connected over the Internet, you do not need to use a telecommunications company where you live or where you travel.
Nor is there any requirement that you get a local number from the community where you live; you can get an internet connection via satellite in the wilderness of Chicken, Alaska and choose a number that claims to be in sunny Arizona.
You can often buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to reach you. Where the number is from matters to people who call you.
Real-time text translation apps - applications that can automatically translate entire text segments from one language to another.
Some applications in this category can even translate text in foreign languages on signs or other real-life objects when the user directs his smartphone against these objects.
Translation engines have improved considerably, and now often provide more or less accurate translations (and less often nonsense), but a degree of caution is needed, as they may still have understood the text completely wrong.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading data for desired languages.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you are abroad.
It can be cheaper than buying new maps for a GPS, or a stand-alone GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have data connection on your mobile, or if it is uncovered, their performance may be limited or unavailable.
Each corner store is filled with a confusing collection of prepaid phone cards that can be used in phone booths or regular phones.
While most cards can be used to call anywhere, some specialize in providing favorable call rates to a particular group of countries.
Access to these services is often obtained through a freephone number that can be called from most phones without cost.
The rules that apply to ordinary photography also apply to video recording, perhaps even to an even greater extent.
If it's forbidden to just photograph something, don't even think about filming it.
If you are using a drone, check carefully in advance what is allowed to film and what permits are required.
Flying with a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal where you live.
Nowadays, flights are booked only in rare cases directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the price of the same flight can differ enormously from different booking points and it is advisable to compare search results and to look at the airline's website before booking.
You do not need a visa for short-term trips to certain countries as a tourist or business traveler, but if you are going to study, you will probably stay in the country longer than if you are a tourist.
If you stay in a foreign country for a long time, you generally need to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than regular tourist or business visas.
In most countries you will need an invitation from the institution where you want to study, as well as proof that you can support yourself financially for at least the first year of your course.
Check with the department, as well as the immigration department of the country you want to study in for detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, work abroad usually means that you have to declare income tax in the country in which you work.
Income tax is structured in different ways in different countries, and tax rates and tax classes vary widely from one country to another.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal level and at the local level, so tax rates and classes may vary from region to region.
Even if entry checks are usually missing or constitute a formality when you enter your home country, customs controls can be difficult.
Make sure you know what you are allowed and not allowed to take with you, and declare everything across legal boundaries.
The easiest way to get started working as a travel writer is to hone your talents on an established website for travel blogs.
When you have become comfortable formatting and editing on the web, you can later create your own website.
Volunteering while travelling is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a very good way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn more about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even acquire new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere because many volunteer jobs offer food and lodging and a few pay a small salary.
Vikings used the Russian waterways to reach the Black and Caspian Seas. Parts of these routes are still usable.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mainly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga River, so it is still possible to get through Russia from the Caspian Sea.
You can be sure that once you reach the marina, everything will be quite obvious. You will meet other boaters who share their information with you.
You will basically put up notices where you offer your help, walk around the quays, talk to people who clean their yachts, try to make contact with sailors in the bar, etcetera.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone will know you and give you tips on which boat is looking for someone.
You should carefully select your Frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
Even if you may think it is intuitive to become a member of the airline you fly with the most, you should be aware that the benefits are often different and the bonus points can be more generous with another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their trips to Africa, providing connections to many major African cities at prices more competitive than other European airlines.
In 2014, Turkish airlines flew to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have additional travel time, check how your total travel price to Africa can be compared to an earth-round fare.
Do not forget to expect extra costs for additional visas, travel taxes, land transport etc. for all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world completely in the southern hemisphere, the selection of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of Transocean routes.
No airline alliance operates all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not operate any of the crossings).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Sea from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This is not the only flight option if you want to skip the southern part of the Pacific and the western coast of South America.
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged a war against the Azeri.
With Armenian support a new republic was created. However, no established nation recognizes it - not even Armenia.
Diplomatic arguments over the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th century district surrounding Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The entire area is designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means the five countries, consists of the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso and is located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces in the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that shoot out over the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible business development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages and cars do not reach them from the outside.
The variations of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are a little different from the French spoken in France, but they are just as good for understanding one another.
Especially in the numbering system in the French-speaking parts of Belgium and Switzerland there are some small peculiarities that are different from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is a little different.
In any case, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss should learn the standard French at school, so they would understand you even if you used the French standard system for numbers.
"In many parts of the world, a wave is a kind gesture that means "hello."
"But in Malaysia, at least among the Malaysians in the countryside, it means "come here", similar to the index finger bent to the body, a gesture used in some Western countries and should only be used for this purpose."
"In the same way, a British traveler in Spain may miss a wave with his palm against the waver (rather than against the waver) as a gesture signaling ""come back.""
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created to facilitate communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua franca languages, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for some reason as a way of communicating between speakers of other languages.
During the midday heat, travelers may experience mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveller tries to reach the mirage, while wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can become extremely cold at night. Cooling down is a serious risk if you lack warm clothes.
Beware of mosquitoes if you decide to hike in the rain forest during the summer.
Whether you drive through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open as you step into the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.
Avian influenza, or avian influenza as it is called more formally, can infect both birds and mammals.
Less than one thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most have been about people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for birdwatchers.
Typical for Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less even, plateau.
"You often refer to these plateaus as "wide," meaning a vast, open landscape without trees, a boundless expanse."
"In Rogaland and Agder they are often called "hei", which means a treeless heathland, often covered with heather."
The glaciers are not stable, but move downwards along the mountain. This causes cracks, which can be hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and cracks can be closed.
At the edge of the glacier, large blocks break off, fall down and can sometimes jump or roll further from the edge.
The tourist season in the mountain towns is generally the highlight of the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter, when many mountain stations get plenty of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer special fares in case of death, with a certain discount for last-minute funeral trips.
Airlines offering these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights departing from the United States or Canada, and Westjet.
The trip must always be booked directly with the airline by phone.
