It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The finding also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
With the dinosaur feathers not having a well - developed stem, so - called coil, but with other characteristics of feathers — rays and biradiols — the researchers concluded that the coil was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the springs indicates that they were not used to fly but instead for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chicken down, although the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers argued that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by forces resembling tides of the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts attraction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists succeeded in finding that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of masses of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put an oppressed sheet of paper with their elected candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the approach fairly strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the competent voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers who are under extensive supervision, and who follow specific procedures, are counted.

Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
"Vice Chief Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop.""
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared at the court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but any eyewitness evidence can become worthless because her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the United Kingdom but Scottish law works differently and courts have regarded publication of photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish images etc. of suspects.""
The Criminal Department (Crown Office), which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has stated to journalists that no further comments will be made prior to prosecution.
According to the leak, the document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reported on are Jerusalem's future, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while PA only authorises to leave such presence for five years.
Hunters in the complementary pest control experiment would be closely monitored by park rangers, when the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly sworn in a new provisional election council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth provisional election council within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some that have lapsed since 2011.
There have been reports of approximately 60 cases where misconstructed iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing four people minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (Metti) said it was known of 27 accidents related to the units.
"METI announced last week that Apple had informed of 34 further incidents with overheating, which the company called ""relieved.""
"Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of report ""very regrettable.""
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Service announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six scourges, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she was in need of toilet visits. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone were given, it would speed up the pneumonia of the fetus.
"Xinhua reported government investigators salvaged two ""black boxes"" on Wednesday."
Wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman."
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I...maybe even bigger...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's better where she is now.""
Out of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign at the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elisabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swam 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with various hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water resources on earth, along with organic matter, that can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took up his rule earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as ""political chatter and nonsense""".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean that the planes fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology unlike older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is deployed, and trains over land will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
Fear of lack of means of transport opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in Science magazine reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrated Españoladarwin finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn to thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called ""enlightened manuscripts""."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes the shade depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The PH value is shown by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together, then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call a hundred miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space using rockets, and scientists are using telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a little of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket of over 30 meters to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet treasures) who eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it from rivaling with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called flocks.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like flocks of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
As the all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human being.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a meaning of growling, screaming words.
Ozeloter likes to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelote hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (change) via the smell, by sniffing on the ground where they were found.
They can see very well in the dark with dark vision and even move very stealthily. Ocelots chase their prey by blending into their surroundings and then throw themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small stock) are separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
In time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look smaller and smaller like the second population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that people emit (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make our clothes out of plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other Mosasaurs.
The long jaws were possessed with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning that there was no chance of escaping for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue; its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feast elements such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called hazelmus.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half lie on the side while eating their meals.
Antique Roman meals cannot have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods who were considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziqqurater, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked on the farm; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic fairy tales it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as a punishment for murder, and that when he travelled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
"Although each country was ""Scandinavian"", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"" were written". the text appears on the underside of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (with dimensions of 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was only written there as a label.
The landings of Day D and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who agreed with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allied invaded southern France, the invasion was called ""Operation dragoon""."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also somehow defines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations: a civilised culture means the transfer of knowledge between generations, a lingering cultural footprint and a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - according to the articles of the Confederacy.
Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes and, because there was no national exercise power or judiciary, it fell on the authorities of the states, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be added and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, along with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bike, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch Eastern Indian Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiates a transformation of the origin production of cereals and employs Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat of 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then rules the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, Sun Temple and Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for stills in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but even more important is its aspect ratio inherited into the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-millimetre format is, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The side ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest full digit ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The highly abused and often ridiculed third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a certain order in an image.
It is argued that the best location for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had linked European states together despite their differences in languages and practices.
Its ubiquitous power affected all from king to common man.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity says that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain began a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated widely accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the past two hundred years.
The UK mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Given a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most residents and countries.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation being repeated in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to start working at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; every stadium in China's history, or every family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The best known of these periods were the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynastys.
During these periods, violent warfare was often waged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history when thousands of people died in the battle to sit in the highest chair of the great palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all applicants men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as rank within the army was now founded on calibre instead of on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make revolution.
"Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He would often visit a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on the ""Noor"" mountain (light) to contemplate."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual tendencies.
The cave, located on one of the peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave there is total isolation.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians of the third century B.C.E., the Cheops pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the valley of Egyptian Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples and the Great Sphinx."
The Cheops pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The mark for "up-street" looks like a V and the mark for "down-straight" like a buncher or a square that lacks bottom side."
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means you should start at the froschen (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
A walkway usually generates a softer sound, while a descent is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but remember that the printed string markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, madam Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris on 6 October 1789 from Versailles by a bunch of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a chariot surrounded by a crowd shouting and calling out threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open wide at the end.
At one point one of the participants in the mob wielded his head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great profits derived from the protracted exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era of events often calls the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th century to the 14th century.
The High Middle Ages was preceded by older Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces many different ideas in practice, from the fact that technology drives development or the technological imperative in the strict conception that man's destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned."
For example, it could be said that the motorized car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism featured a major element of determinism originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals and over time mores and culture arose related to this geography, and these, harmonizing with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate at approximately AD 400 and continued until about AD 1100.
Its influence declined in the 14th century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked between the 12th to 12th centuries and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, the styles of the West could lag by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-catering farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient in farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and let them find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to members' age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that determine a subculture that is distinctive may be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical character, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
"Such children are called "wild". Some wild children have been shut in by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness all on their own.
When the wild child is brought up entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical boundaries) almost entirely identical to that of the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support teaching goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the small paperback man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is meant to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to handle by himself.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring or educational, but that happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system should provide safe homes, loving care providers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster homes are meant to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Also ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining the audience's reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpression correctly.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing ""President's speech"" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shovel variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savanna it is difficult for a primate with an digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from the plants available.
In addition, there is a lack of this serious consequences; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
By comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only readily digestible, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savanna do today."
Sleep breaks are the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively silent alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can put it at the other end of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of liquid (especially water or tea, a known liquid driver) before sleeping, making one have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates opposite to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has expanded with the path of love within the Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (information energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Gudsyoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of different gods, energy channels are purified, chakras activated and enlightened awareness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in system, process and culture led to the collapse of the countries’ cooperation.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken and the only hope was to retire and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violated the peace agreement in Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them for milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Tamgotts were usually held in buckets that walked on hills or other pastures, often nestled by shepherds who were many times children or young people, similar to the better known shepherd. These methods of dithering are still used today.
Trams for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses who drew them to achieve higher speeds and draw greater loads than on the slightly coarser roads of the time.
Slippers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This came to be practice, but iron tore more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In time, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. The first iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was hiking, people began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, was not in the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases symptomatic treatment, but if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have worsened because of overpopulation and mankind’s extravagant lifestyle.
After it had been adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
"During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as ""Dunlap broadsides""".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the farm in Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which had it read to its troops in New York City on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broad pages known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Inner poisoning is not always noticed immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open bottle of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term rams are used in formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both predator beetles and bedbugs are nesters, adapted to live in its host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or is in the best interests of their children.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents renounce their rights so that another couple may raise the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is indicative in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. To experiment, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view of all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not only reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main hints that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fairies, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that marked either DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited into children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for the work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow linked to, and supports, a transport system based on private carism.
Science now shows that this massive coal economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems; virtually everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so much complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because preliminary work cannot be predicted with 100% safety.
As well as being, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow on reasonably consistent and can be broadly presented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of facilities along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to trap their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot trap their wings are dragonflies and daisies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchos said the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world’s most water - rich and second - longest river, more than 8 times the size of the second - largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from earth’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 km. It gets its water gets thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza's size and construction technology were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the new Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors who were well over a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the world’s smallest independent country and the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical substances such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are included in metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit at the point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a faithful companion to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, when newer writing methods have been developed, the pencil has been given a lower status and fewer uses.
Today people write messages on computer screens, and never need to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to achieve a core of many protons and neutrons.
Much like rolling a heavy carriage up a hill. To split the core again, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and not much is needed for them to disintegrate.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the hither side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the moon seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. It made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people started or what appeals to them.
The theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized gradually they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment makes them do or don't do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally, two behaviors may appear when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain ""one of the gang""."
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary action, evaluate performance, assign responsibility and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything that the team has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behaviour often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to serve as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can influence when their team can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it makes the field of research narrower and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain damage, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in each class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where buses are not available.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can watch museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Virtually sharing a study trip is also a good way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is remade every year, but previous versions may remain online as a clipboard book.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. The students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
As students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the outside world". The requirement to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Suitable use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific questions (Oravac, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums showing Canada's present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All this and more marks Ontario with what outsiders consider the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are near uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its own continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the seaway from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would regard as harassment, and it is not unusual for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand on yourself (cultural differences don't make it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 11th century fvt and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole spectrum of crimson, but that all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located far east near the Rwandan border.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Nyiragongo which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you are going to visit outside Goma, you should examine what the fighting is like in northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote locations."
Today Timbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included on the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the major stops under Henry Louis Gate's PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city is in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger national park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is Crocodile river.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which houses various wildlife.
It is one of the biggest sights in South Africa and it is considered the flagship among South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus.
The buildings in a row that make up Hong Kong's silhouette have been likened to a glittering bar chart reinforced by the water in the port of Victoria.
To see the best views in Hong Kongs, leave the island and head to Kowloon's sea side opposite.
The vast majority of the settlement on Hong Kong island is tightly packed together on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian inland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been adopted on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining stalls of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is made up of wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Axish deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district common bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30 p.m.
Since buses between the distractions are often full, it is good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to places nearby, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge, stretching across the Oyapock River and tying together the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two aisles that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
Guaraní was the most significant indigenous group that inhabited the present eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of native tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called ""The Giant Province of India", was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the indigenous indigenous people."
The Spaniards began the period of colonization which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is well known because their polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please turn to Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Punde (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the store FIC West.
GBP is usually received everywhere in the islands, and Stanley is often able to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and US currency can be received; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common
Winter can be fraudulently cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and humidity combine and make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison oxen, elk, candah deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Furthermore, keep in mind that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells and keeping the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, located on the island of Upolu and has a population just below 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to the location of Auckland between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The shores of North Shore (in North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where bathing is safe, and most of them offer Maori Myrtle shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-attended family beaches with a good range of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta"."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may manage the trip better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are concerned.
"For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A ""short black""" is "espresso", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Nevertheless, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to security warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile lies in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Pre-booking provides the traveller with security and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even package travel combining flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close where things happen you have to come early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as going through ice causes really terrible noises for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or watches, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and pleasure to keep their guests in good spirits and keep them in the room.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowy or by condensation or ice on the vehicle window.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to travel across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you see them better with binoculars.
"Going safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of hiking either a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies on the occasion of the coronavirus look different, but by the end of March most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have begun.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical fare around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burn).
There are different ways to clean water, and some are more effective against specific dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters may vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Harmful animals can destroy food, cause irritation or, at worst, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods without tax or other supplements in certain places.
Passengers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often runs through isolated primeval terrain.
If you are not used to driving on highways, drive with reason: steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
Set speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and their compliance is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other stretches, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbor in the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round as well as cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often fit especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other of the coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes scattered around the country.
But if used without a determination word, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the island kingdom, offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, where the tasters used by the Javaneses are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stigbyglar is support for the rider's feet hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but is stuck with a foot in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders have boots with heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that ensure that a stirrup loosens from the saddle if pulled back by a rider falling off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's main destination for climbing, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountaintops offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world constantly create new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Skiing, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that glide down a snowcapped landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date as far back as 5,000 BC!
Passing as a sport has existed at least since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry ski, tour skiing or ski trekking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or rock climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as on a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to handle slightly greater distances than walking – but you only rarely get up at speeds like cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries; under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport checks on a number of occasions.
However, the Schengen area functions much like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing passport checks more times.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other occupations.
Even historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like and used reindeer mostly as drag animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
"Although it is often used, especially among non-romania, the word ""gypsy"" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and erroneous perceptions of Romani peoples."
If the country you visit is subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, for American citizens in the Middle East there may be other circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel council is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often hasty, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause injury, serious social disruption or the loss of human life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variants of them, which may be due to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfire are the types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, skystrokes and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include fierce blizzards, sizzling weather, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly recommended to be aware of the risk of harsh weather affecting their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for ""enemy environmental education"" is likely to provide the address of a local company."
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here though much more detailed, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role playing, very first aid and sometimes gun training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books dealing with war zones are rare.
Passengers planning a gender-correcting operation abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for their return.
The will of governments to issue passports without specified gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The will of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checks have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 period.
Transgender persons who have not undergone surgery shall not expect to be able to pass through X-ray control with integrity and dignity retained.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking off at the beach, often at a reef or similar.
The topology under water allows the reflow to be concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after attempting to swim back countercurrently, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim somewhere where you do not get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been discovered, wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the cultural shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), goes on longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have had an easy time adapting to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture's habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because of the knowledge that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travellers returning home.
The pyramids sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The audio and light story is just like a storybook.
The background is Sphinxen, who tells a long story.
The scenes appear on the pyramids, and the various pyramids become illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are several countries claiming, and they have the most bases, sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater to an active volcano constitutes a spectacular natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plateau and then return to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain chain, which is divided in half by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson massif, with a highest peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and votes.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Travelling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before the university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad may actually increase the chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Usually a fee is charged to register for these teaching programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The thousand lakes also have thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer another experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat of every seventh- or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specific Baltic cruises include a longer hiatus in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while you return to and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in its brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by air can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of their age and background, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that very many people have.
Understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that is due to discomfort in the face of the unknown or to being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent things by air cargo, it may have taken several days on certain routes to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline rules do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out with a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, let your business do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is no use even looking for discounts for seating in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travellers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of travelling somewhere fast and convenient. The companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but which is not recognised by any of the member countries of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The city, known in historical times as Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge harbour surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with the glass facades and modern shopping malls are mixed with traditional red tiled roofs, the 18th century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to Mediterranean-Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some of the graves.
It is worth strolling about half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach of the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 drives regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the stunning Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), a place world famous for revelations of Mary.
Remember, you are actually visiting a mass burial site and a site that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women in life who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as by law it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other facilities.
Common messages in the subway are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a wrong stereotype, the best way to manage in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved). It will make it much easier to get around."
The brusque appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your polite side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is grown with dense forest, the main one with beech, spruce and noble fir, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly large species richness, due to the extent of microclimates, different soils, and varying elevation differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and fetter are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts covering their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must dress in pants covering their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but those garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan food, like that in similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and consistently uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun you, are written with a large initial letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to find out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing slightly more complicated.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies on the basis of the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and r different: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has relatively light and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can find good help in learning much about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this basic grammar book.
Of course, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the type of problem that they are today, they are usually found in cities or in university areas, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the view of cherry bloom, has been part of Japanese culture since the 7th century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the Emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a ""copy"" it will also get you ejected, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
"But with its placement in the ""high tropics"" just a few degrees north of the equator you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less rarely)."
There are also a small number of buses going north to Hebron, the traditional cemetery where the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives rest.
Check that the bus you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been raised by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Night Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation then breaks up to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived in the islands came here by either swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to cross, so the giant turtle became the primary grazing animal on Galapagos.
Since man came to the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark more or less 24 hours a day.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution thus often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costume is the normal business outfit, and colleagues address each other with surnames or with job title.
Workplace harmonisation is crucial, with emphasis on joint efforts rather than emphasising the performance of individuals.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without doubt.
