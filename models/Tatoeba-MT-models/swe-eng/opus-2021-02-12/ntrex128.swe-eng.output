A.M. in Wales is worried about "promising like idiots"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM all over the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who don't know Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means poop.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "missed" and has suggested other options.
A conservative Welshman said that his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the Assembly should be called is of course up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Wales Parliament.
Regarding the title of AM, the Commission proposed the Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or the WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM apparently proposes other options, but problems in reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to call when debating the legislation.
Macedonia is holding a referendum to change its name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the neighbouring country's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
President Ivanov of Macedonia is opposed to the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will ignore the result.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent when the churches of Harlem run into trouble
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars should disappear.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Barer is not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as far as the leaders expect and that "at some point they will end up in square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The vast majority of people buying apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments probably won't become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black parish led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's parish planned the renovation, they also built the bell game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the watch of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some employed by the church's laymanship, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church meeting – the congregation’s governing body made up of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July and expressed concern that the diocese would “try to pass on the cost” to the church general meeting, despite the fact that the church meeting had not been involved when the diocese engaged architects and entrepreneurs.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark hurts 13-year-old diving for lobster in California
Last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the whole clavicles had been torn up.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" said Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is reported to be critical.
It's unclear what shark it was.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's going into Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty routes with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the major beauty pathways will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempts to fill the shelves that were previously raised by TV sets, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with marked areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The retail chain is also re-launching its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan – as more and more young customers require.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the stand in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second one will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy small amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an effort to fight against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempts of the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenue from Boots sales in supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty gestures a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "racial" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "crazy" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s mark Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "racial" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer had time to focus on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated wealth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise ready to be sold at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that this Morning presenter's decision to withdraw can cost the company several million due to considerable investments in everything from pillows and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in launching.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as chairman in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones own 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk "and we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for being so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newsman's voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore meeting in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly last Saturday that North Korea does not see a "equivalent response" from the US after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that the US is instead continuing sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results – an end to rocket tests, freed hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people here," said Trump, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had lost their homes, a state of emergency was not announced, as is required for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which complicates it all," said Ms. Sumbang.
Save the Children brings together a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman of the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
There have been tsunami protections built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rails.
But poor funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr Joko is also under pressure by lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturidge signed the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in the 89th minute of Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick towards the far pole.
The experiment flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturidge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think much about it. I just kicked him."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue streaked a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spun off near the midfield and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the midfield.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is facing VIdeoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Death to tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been stuck in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 earthquake that struck last Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters,” said the firm’s spokesman Sutomo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380 000 inhabitants, was full of debris from buildings that had collapsed.
The police are arrested, 32, suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We're at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found is living in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relative.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can come in or get out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area is being treated like a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She says "it's so awful" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the perimeter and another just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the perimeter with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of argument about rewriting history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate about removing statues."
The Iconoclasmen of the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell demonstrates the 19th century's opinion and is part of the historiography of a man who many believe should still be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, an ongoing historical debate is being held.
But the conflict in the mid-17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and celebrated.
Killer Pig Kills Peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a stia on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported last Sunday.
A pig breeder is getting ready to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the piggy bank with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250 - kilo [250 kg] heavy pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin identified with the last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan coming to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare for pigs to attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kilos pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're nibbled and very curious, and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa for vast heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at 5 EST last Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and travels east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create vast heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5-10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mud flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trough brings some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to mud flows and slippery roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the Northeast United States.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great chance for warmer temperatures than average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Over 20 million looked at Thursday’s touching testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults that were supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday’s last minute twist – Arizona’s Senator Jeff Flakes’ agreement with the FBI where they were given a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure Kavanaugh grabbed her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that last Friday the number of viewers was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people watching from offices.
Comparatively, there are as many viewers as there are for a football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters shouted at him, which was broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after questioning the committee.
The television networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted in case they were to pass on Kavanaugh's nomination for a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do that if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, as the minority democrats have urged.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "fully unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims dropped his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
According to Advocate, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's escape unit, the police's state justice lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flit and the quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Last Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this kind of thing all the time," Wade said.
The volcano vomits ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and the recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mulles and quakes.
Pictures of social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police strike with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after independence protesters met with riot police while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by riot police threw eggs and paint powder on them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
According to local press, 14 people were treated for minor damage caused by protests.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region, which longs for independence one year after the referendum of first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low as most who were opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1 000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote at electoral stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but had to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are in favour of independence have had difficulty keeping up the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been hit by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
Last Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he intends to run for office in the European elections next year.
"Valeration to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into houses
Three men — 33, 34, and 39 — have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston secured the winnings
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not got an away win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning distance to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against abrupt visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their straightforwardness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the target.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in definite games.
And that's how the ultimate goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to give Menga a chance, which scored from the center of the target area.
In that situation the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team’s defense was impenetrable and goaltender Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goaltender Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's definite games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two penalty requirements – after Halkett’s challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the credit for galvanizing the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilful organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on edge straight through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments during Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not measure up – they only opened the home side once – and it is something of an alarm clock for the Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue skies (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become at odds with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German Government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duelling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by certain German Turks and condemned as an aggressor by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trafficked road in Deptford, southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics were called there, but the man died on the scene.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash last Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his immediate relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been diverted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in turmoil
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The unrest broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST last Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on one wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be attributed to the police and may be given increased prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospitals after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dried areas can benefit)
It is rare for tropical low pressure to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls across the desert in the southwestern United States, at the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, probably get 2.5-5 cm rain at the risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but part of the rain will probably be useful because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force this Sunday morning with maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, calming it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may have heavy rain, which poses a considerable risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona’s border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST last Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to their cell phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "sled, meanness, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthlessness and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the evil, the anger of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress last Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The president said last Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running for office, but I'm running for office," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to resist and prevent.
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, numbers rising
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities last Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six metres of waves crashed towards the beach at dusk and swept out many to a certain death and destroyed everything in its path.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency, GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone but dragged cars, logs and houses with it. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times the size of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries may be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," said Nugroho.
"There are over 300 000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The Bureau was criticized last Saturday for not informing us that the tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building shouts frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes towards the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive blackout that interrupted all communication around Palu, which made the rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights there with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for relief work and remains closed to other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
People from World Vision in Donggala have made their way to Palu where they seek shelter during tarpaulins in the yard outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid teams have begun the difficult development work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared following a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it's a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status hasn't been announced yet."
When the second evening fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that light up gloomy natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
Last Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paraglider coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandami, were his students.
"As a paraglider veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the paragliders heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got one gray goat, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 during ATM refills at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's employee who filled up an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM in the entertainment facility and was going to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy "srunning another man up behind the Brink's employee" and stealing a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday and said: "The creature formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled for "emotional reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'yes' is the word used most in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has previously written its name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlateolco Plaza last Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2nd, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
A double budget could double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top rated American Othello player, and later he was in the lead of Microsoft Research and was the CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next one would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the US with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
The China State Council issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that will bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the change of name
The people of Macedonia voted last Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to 'North Macedonia', which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has hindered its attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a requirement of its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question of the ballot in the referendum is as follows: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zaev, claim that it is worth changing their names if it allows Macedonia, one of the countries that was formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I am voting for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Stromica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and place chairs in front of the tents set up by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote in favour, because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a study published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Survey, between 30% and 43% of voters voted in the referendum, which falls below the minimum participation required.
According to another study by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants were going to vote on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to count, 50% of registered voters plus one have to vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for Western government policy since it took over last May.
Look at: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero going through the whole Brighton defense to score goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean streaker got a pass from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green sweaters.
He got around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premier League struggle.
Target arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it got out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force another start.
But competitive Scherzer wants to throw Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who is a match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance for the playoffs.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but is still after his first division title.
“We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals has not announced their starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports they lean against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"All that we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running for a candidate, but I'm running for a candidate. That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They're determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their meanness, their horribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control; that's what they want, power and control; we're not going to let them have it."
Democrats, he said, struggle to "stand back and stop."
"You've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the democrats angry and mean and horrible and false."
He mentioned democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by high booing from the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you leak the document?'
'Eh, uh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who are told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar subjects to which Jeremy criticised former leaders.
The announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" politics has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged from the outside if the leaders of the party accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I thought had a similar political view as I expected me to make a turnaround and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was national security or the European internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – follows a tirade of obscurity on social media that requires my dismissal, criticises middle politics and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era's policies is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, however, we are no longer this broad church and, with every vote of censure and change in the selection rules, the party is becoming increasingly narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too forthright, so "it's all set."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s neglect that literally brought down my primary school classroom, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as Minister of Government.
I've never hidden my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the motion last Friday, I just want to say that when the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats of disposal or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unbeated Ayr on top
Two last-minute attempts may have distorted the result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now on top, the only unbeaten side of the Ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our games so far and are still unbeaten, so of course we are happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt for the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the game, Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a 17-5 lead at the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr led again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Ayr’s action Captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayrs maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant business after it was discovered that he has been designated as the CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC’s popular series, which he writes and plays in together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Akrifmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The bases of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon's carrying motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on first October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the drive, a mood of unity and peace, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of Justice in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
Monday's decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the court judges in Bolivia’s favour, and that even if it does, little would change.
The United Nations Court, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia’s chances.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has ravaged Chile’s remaining benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not replaced ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of differences with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament demands trust in the United States
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made at a Singapore Summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of solving the deadlock of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "desiring dream" that continued sanctions and US protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism against Pyongyang’s really getting rid of an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line huge headgear en route to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crazy, oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style icons on Paris fashion week.
Unbelievably impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an excessive beige hat with a feather-like wide hat brim that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a warlock hat and even a pineapple – but they are not meant to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn together lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with a snorkel and a diving mask, and another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue that enormous courage, you'll be lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge caps may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come just after La Bomba – the straw hat with a brim of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratijkowski.
The cult mark behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective advances in sport, art, music and other community engagement.
With up to 30 000 pupils in Scotland, schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement custom curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received a final sample of Higher Grade.
Data, collected from the SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students studying tangerine received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of students studying German, 69 per cent of students studying French and 63 per cent of students studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that employers found it difficult to fill their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
Having said that, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choices, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in total in a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be most important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really should be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le fere.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events at places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by his candidate for the post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress ahead of the forthcoming elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be dealing with this week's interrogation of the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense after allegations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the vote by the Senate of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November elections.
Thus, President Trump said that these five assemblies next week are aimed at "engaging volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
Night's events, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has lagged behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to keep hopes alive for Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the match competitions on Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the module is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in the face of competitions like these.
So which moment is it now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we wear it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example.
The winning calls were rattled even higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been behind by two after two games.
His putt who won them the game of 15 met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all all those players have left now.
Eighteen holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup’s indisputable story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions state that they are players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could bring home a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, along with Alex Noren.
One bowey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole that they never even got close to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Four ball and foursome are so fascinating to see at close range because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead for the last day but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubts about.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's four ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and brought home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American team that never really got started during the morning four ball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cups history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more assertive 5 & 4.
Woods, who beat his way through two games on Saturday, showed a few moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four ball and foursome, and hence seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning four ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not have the tailwind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They brought home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has a team come back from a disadvantage of four points in the single matches, however, Furyk's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they "never" will disarm unilaterally without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations last Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible that it would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea had taken "significant steps to demonstrate its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing installations and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang previously did.
Mr Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Mr Kim Jong Un and Mr Donald Trump at the first summit between a incumbent US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Mr Kim promised to work towards the "disposal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Mr Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first phase out its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also turned down negotiations to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "disposal first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even objects to the "declaration of ending the war"", says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wishful dream for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Mr Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Mr Kim and Mr Trump, which the US leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the mainland of the United States of America with rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but it said that much work still remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The maintenance of Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without failure until we achieve complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gang-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear breach complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "days".
One academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often clueless about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior directly.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
Pride culture in "day" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has studied one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before starting their studies at the high performance department.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around the clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target lowers Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 downer team in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking to take home his first victory on the way since February 4-1-triumf at St Johnstone, but Gary Holts team delivered Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half time and the Rangers never evened out the results.
As the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the lye for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerard made eight changes to the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, joined the same Livi 11 who took a point from the Hearts last week and he would have been delighted at the way his well-anointed game outshined the opponents every time.
The Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass let Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big shot and fired outside.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have had punishment when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half but the former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots in the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their nagging deserved it.
Again the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher suited Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple closure.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the prey gave almost immediate effect when the winger hit the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the co-players to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened its leadership in the final stage, but McGregor was well able to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
The Ranger replacement Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was molested with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now one page from Sunday's calendar: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger Meter.
Geiger meters have become the foundation stone of science since then and also represent large in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger meter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a fluttering appearance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he himself would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee about the allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the playback of West’s layout was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I've fallen low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to sink too?" and said he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
"Try with love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said: "There was death silence in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU TO REST ON THE MOB."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was itself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased musical legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
They're trying to kill a man after cutting a knife in a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-turning role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken out against the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even her 31, admitted that he feels "quite strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strongly, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine character.
He continued "What is native and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it is really one of the big issues of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife because of the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estates in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the contagion cases are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked GOP-senator tasks, covering "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The American congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday claims that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lilies, lies and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Panel hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded assertion is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is entirely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly received online criticism, including from White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper of being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the questioner.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to be trying to compare Water's reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters in the middle of his term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great about true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities for these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with a British inclination, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodies that was launched in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satire come about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has got his license to screw up sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for biopublics even in non-English speaking countries
He is of course the weird secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims of smoothie glamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval armor and when the rotor blades for a short time hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor feels rather low-key and strangely redundant, especially since the "serious" film brands 007 and Mission Imlossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humor feels as if it is suitable for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English's strange pranks are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film exploits in the role of Bean.
The constantly topical issue is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents in the field, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-pressed figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of her political popularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in person, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its former persistent sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly hockey stick role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer fight: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical pranks: dressed up as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate all in all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that a plan is being drawn up for Britons to work a four-day week but receive pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that involves the British working a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party is reported to want business leaders to hand over savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trades union congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in a day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits in with the party's attitude to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Greens party that promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and it is not the party's agreement."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless leaders" and "sniffers" at government companies.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get their entire contribution back, as a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive has been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10 percent of the private company's equity is handed over to its employees, who will then receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the 60 minute TV program tell us whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's investigations could change the position of some Republican senators on the matter.
In an interview broadcast last Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the statement came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was firm, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unwavering.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of her names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive display of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pilgrimage to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international community of protagonists who hope to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, email a world leader, call or in other meaningful ways help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they are making real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that it has registered more than 19 million "documents" from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders who are engaged in "helping children develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can do social injustice as malnutrition is to a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on his website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its fleet in a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports indicating the Minister of the Interior
The government may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that maritime routes are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are indeed the same.
"The economic alternative towards Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "dayfly" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements will come after the Trump administration's objective is to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin the "convict" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington’s opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was reversed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading trade association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike that a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia's President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "regular thinker" if she's going to run for election in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "regular thinker" about her participation in the presidential election following the US mid-year elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said.
"After the 6th of November, I'm going to take some serious thought of running for president."
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The study showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he was going to make an official decision in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through now that he is back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with," she said to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and aviators and all the other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempted to obstruct a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in intoxicated states, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as the District of Columbia, support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support judicial redress against a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberty Union submitted in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision of the immigration authorities of 2014 allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignorates decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary workforce".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu when the death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more bleak.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rooting through water - damaged possessions, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals injured in the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital of Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong post-shocks.
With tearful eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a quadrilateral ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a contribution in Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the 6th US Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other’s imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supports the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is now doubling bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of speech and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper booth on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economy, because the media are ruled by the Chinese Communist Party with an iron hand," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which magazine.
Republicans scare off female voters for mid-year elections through the Kavanaugh fiasco, warn analysts
Since many top republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who is facing multiple allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn the clock back, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning they announced the demonstration "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building when the Republicans who control the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the ceiling," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been loud, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse of the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh comes through, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic electoral campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those of at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that that candidate of the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers who will work with the project and a group of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are set high overnight.
"We don't ask them permission."
In a post at Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic," that the stone would be exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble about."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feel very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead saw Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've been stopping all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were unimpressed after they had stayed awake for the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta gris, yes."
Bellator’s CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their scheduling to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of replay," Coker said.
"But there's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this by Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to show five games instead of six - as we normally do - and we took over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "below" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his peers when he grew up because of his sexuality - but it also spurred him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular director of the popular show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance on Laverne's first show, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others when he was growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "This feeling of feeling less worth and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate of LGBT rights and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that his crush on a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, it was all about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they got their tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a home audience at an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and that still gave him chills.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday’s Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will break record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but then he will have to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the fivefold winner spent his day between cheerleading and practicing his game in the hope of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long run often misses hard.
It is not only the course that discourages, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets the champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below before the 12 single matches have the tailwind in the start, Mickelson’s game can be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's what it is and we're just gonna have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero’s leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won by the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2-13⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and no trouble", said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was pleased with his players' performance on a tough golf course and added: "I could never do this myself.
Tomorrow there will be new challenges.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply, and that is quite another matter.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who combed home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals during the last days of a competition, both on the winning team in Brookline before he finished as a loser when Europe ran "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as quickly as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the tempo gets started in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We did our setup and placed the guys as we wanted to to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas got the task of trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said about his singles.
Germany’s new warships are being postponed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship ship for the brand new Baden-Wuertemberg frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were disastrous for the ambitious project.
The four ships in Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and marine missiles, as well as certain stealth techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they come into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
Weaknesses in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be run by a staff of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship has a significant excess weight, which leads to reduced performance and limits the marine’s ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the entire project price tag - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared with EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up phase.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is in fact "beginning to have a shortage of fully equipped ships".
The official said that this is a growing problem, as old ships are being decommissioned but no replacement ships were being provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops to the secret lives of bats
New research carried out on a property in the highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow South and Dwarf Pipestrell as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from house treasures.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, check nests, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Three, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we do not know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects rape sentence while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "false news" and says that people "want to market themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $35,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) rejected the reports as "false news" when speaking to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirements were reported.
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today was fake news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and all good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called "an unlawful reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "feared of retaliation" and was worried about "becoming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit," said Minister of Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was "uneasy" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer announced that the effects of border delays in the event of no contract being concluded could result in job losses.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without a settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on a 'just-in-time' basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could lead to disruptions at the border, as the industry says, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's consumption in storage at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and hence production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity." he told BBC Radio 4's program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce plant competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with Europe."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues," said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, investigating Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing wiretapping equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of dismissing the President via the 25th Amendment of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his resignation arrived.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York City, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "understand" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for that has not been set, it can be this week, or a delay by a week given all the other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would contest that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters who "play for the gallery", although she said: "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several Question Sessions than any President before him," she said and added without quoting evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president perhaps showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff of NHS Scotland in view of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, ahead of decisions expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I value each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in Saturday’s loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher were taken out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at the hospital Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/ extent of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory Party's new plans
The measure will neutralise Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The UK Treasury expects to receive up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are going to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will boost the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional charge is additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on free-time residences and dwellings purchased to be rented out, which may be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will reduce up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, driving up prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new feature comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "bad housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a spectacular array of proposals for housing reforms, including rental roofs and an end to evictions without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunity to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for hard-working people in our country.
For too many people, the dream of owning their homes has become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old shot looks forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B national team and that was all," says Ross to BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I was growing up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among Ross’s representatives as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding so established names in such a large club. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now I'm assessing success based on the answer to the question 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month-old sejour as a member of Heart's coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa to get back from downgrading to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being near downgrading to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembers and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought that leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live on it fairly. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but practicing feels absolutely right.
I have always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I have ever done during my entire adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has meant increased revenue for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have had more pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA, which has compiled the figures, said: "Stilling beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decline in turnover in restaurants by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolutely best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar who offers food also had a difficult time in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The outcome of managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales went down by 3%."
Paul Newman of the catering and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in terms of sales on the mass caterers market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are still experiencing difficulties, although a decrease in sales of 4,8 % each year is particularly difficult to cope with in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come more inconvenient for companies run by food sales. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give someone much needed respite."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was at 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The industry sales supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub- bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on 47 active groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that sexual content is being posted there
20% of students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has diluted the concern that it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of students said they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and so do they have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled on her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager who urged others to "rape me."
According to the study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headstresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
The chairman of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the board of Scottish Athletics, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most celebrated athlete, and President Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from her broad experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can help and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost his ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell me if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers to cows sharing the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous notices to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song with lines of lyrics like, "Yeah, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a udder, it's tits."
The reflection continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused battle on the internet.
The film has received 77 000 screenings and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "fears".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and feed in order to produce milk, but their cubs are taken away only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comment: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But sure, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What a reality-rejected commercial."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is brilliant.
I would've gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," writes someone.
Another comment: "This is a fun commercial that is aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like 'coss'."
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump tucked into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies and even walk out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pump breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognisable way what an incredible feeling of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk with clothes by designer Marta Jakukowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp near the Texas border
The number of children in detention has skyrocketed, although the number of persons crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly because hateful rhetoric and harsh politics introduced by the Trump government have made it more difficult to place children with reference persons.
In the past, most of the reference persons themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known to law enforcement authorities previously.
"Almost 80% of the people who are either reference persons themselves or family members of reference persons are illegally present in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," Albence said.
In order to deal more quickly with children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month after they were detained, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to staff in the centres.
Many of them are present on a video link rather than in person to bring their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to staff in the centres and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are rising at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of a child having a difficult time are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without enough time to prepare emotionally and say good - bye to friends, many may already experience trauma.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem underlined that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred blow until we have freed all Syrian territories" both from terror groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2 000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly educate and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that make refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They politicise something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ruled out a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-connected Nusra front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the work of the Group would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current Constitution", warning against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless his presidency ends prematurely by impeachment and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there is no sign that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, peak viewing time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and is almost three times higher, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news evenings.
"This is like a fire that people are attracted to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Slovell is a long-standing comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, Washington reporting can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 ("a garment full of hubris", as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, um, anatomy.
I myself will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Some of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes up with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump companion's rotating cast and daily intrigues (mucking quarrels with the NFL, commend Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you fall behind.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he was sitting in the house, owling and watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn't tear himself up, not when Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said: 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the evenst race ever before the mid-year elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania receives lots of money; it is thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district that two members are now competing for the same place.
This recently redesigned suburban district in Pittsburgh is represented by the Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally changed to the Republicans’ advantage.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign financing battle between the main party economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a small profit in a widely guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain head start.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for Chinese aid but then backed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners evicted the Trump organization's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. State Department decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "just made the decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said the Department spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017. The money would go, among other things, to drug control and development and provide financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, putting an end in practice to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.

And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step may be the Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse of justice, for which there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to steer his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that Assembly just as he prepares to stand again in the elections, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertainties in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We must all make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how protracted the struggle can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbaths that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the relentless advance of democracy is either speeded up or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump dismisses Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what happens to Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he should have proposed to record the President secretly last year, and speculated that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times reports don't match.
"How are we going to answer if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may enter the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, in the interim elections, will we vote for a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will face a dark period.
But I do not think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States and 60 years later she sent me away to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the swastika.
With it as a legacy, how could I be other than optimist about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in the Rangers is an optimist for the meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal that ended in a tie earlier in the month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villarreal. However, he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone against greater success.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game thinking we could get something, and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have got it into the end, but on the whole, a tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came again in the second half and was the better team.
This Thursday will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result at their last game, but if we have the audience with us we can surely advance and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you tell them how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a great impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal battles from the start.
Set up a health authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who will review your medical care and ensure that the health care professionals comply with your wishes if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It is not only the economy that is at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medications are those?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
Man fired several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air rifles when he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 2:30 a.m., as a "one-off event".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life - threatening, and the police urge witnesses to call.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indonesia on Friday. It states officials. The death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are down, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain information from the Donggala administration area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main town in the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area that extends along more than 300 km of the coast of the northwestern Sulawesis.
In 2017, the administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299,200 people.
The pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and agriculture, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian authorities for disaster management.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Western Donggala was also affected by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circular seismic ring of fire, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with the magnitude 7.6 struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings collapsing.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok. Over 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, for interfering in a report of domestic violence and for opposing arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is held in custody in Mat-Su detention and is held against a $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the bail terms, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court last Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious Class A crimes, which means that he can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious class B crime, which is punished with a day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by the Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having interfered with the notification of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Films that show when it struck are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City who killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a rental truck from the construction and interior design chain Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan. He mowed down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges can mean a death sentence, according to the court act.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "wide planning and intent", said the prosecutors, and described the way Saipov performed it as "detestable, cruel and inhuman."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrichi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says the letter of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District of New York has not been prosecuted in a case demanding the death penalty for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be put in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 charges in the indictment.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who stated that they are "probably disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the defendant pleads guilty merely prolongs the trauma caused by these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to press for the death penalty.
Tories MEP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at Torie's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must 'feel the heat' from the Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MEPs proposed that he lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MEP, Mr Bone, said at the March in Birmingham that Britain would already have "went out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May to reconcile the deeply divided supporters has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep alive his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, under attack from Brexita supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to get an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spool the Chequers Agreement".
He indicated that Mr Farage should have been made equal and had responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood by the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the district of Wellingborough in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must flush out the Chequers agreement".
He made his opposition to the EU clear and said: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is totally untrue."
Brexitan hanger Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say: 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our election workers who are out on the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a strong message addressed to Theresa May: "Prime ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were to fail the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, 'We are not going to let you get away with it.'"
In the face of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour MEP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"These are the people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "regular thinker" to run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "regular thinker to run for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts last Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against the Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might take on Donald Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
One person arrested for the shooting of basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," said Commissioner Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to jail at the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and averaged in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team orders gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton to dry when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went in the depot first and had Hamilton drive into the back of the cluster, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into depot a turn later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after some wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free at the risk of offering in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and rerun Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived in the pit of the 44th shipyard but failed to speed up the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two", Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the testimony of Ford before the Senate's Justice Committee, instead he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the beauty that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
"We've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't covered up Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia doesn't seem to have suited the president, who commented on it this Saturday night: "I'll tell you one thing.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he indicated that the democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by all means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off Friday’s loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants got an early two-goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowenie signed for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assists from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assists when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cowenie who signed off at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard re-submitted with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cowenie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team’s fifth halfway through the end period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are going to play home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape from earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swaying control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Airs flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian television channel ABC News.
"We arranged for a helicopter from the Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll can rise to over a thousand people. The country’s emergency aid agency says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutomo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the authority.
Up to 20 feet [6 m] of waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will encounter there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific Ocean, now states that one man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not reply immediately to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was slipping past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"That's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through waistwater to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 30 - meter - deep waters.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have been killed in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended their plea in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to piece together the 29-year-old addressed Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers movements the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed last Saturday and said that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "sly, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis some time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing session on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol thinks that hip-hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
One black again?!
A nanny in New York sues a couple because of dismissal after a "racist" text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a miscast text message from the mother, complaining that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racist and compare the mood with blackmail.
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she understood that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black, when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEJ DOESN'T A WIFE IGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "soft at ease", and fired Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal. She claims compensation in the order of $350 a day for the job she was originally hired to do, which would last six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple turn down the charges that they were going to be racist and say that the only straight thing was to end Giselle Maurice's employment, and they were worried that they wouldn't be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you'd been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "extortion" and said that his wife would have children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Should you attack such a person?
It's not very nice done," added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think readers would be able to relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
"He was rather quiet, and no boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. One becomes proud of the child even if it is not one who has achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he would always give Paddington the credit himself."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died shortly before, and now everything went out.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to pull myself together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult test she went through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed down my head, and tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Griefing women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put pictures on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She says that her son was a promising chef who had an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling after he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to make people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother died.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It rips up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates an investigation.
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would be "split" due to deep-rooted disagreements.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the timing.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6th. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country’s Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors "sink" under Kim
The number of North Koreans dropping out to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes information from the South Korean Ministry of Reunion, says that 1 127 people dropped out last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher fees to traffickers, are important causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, the vast majority of defectors from North Korea are offered Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the firm-run negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions of the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he's unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysteric'," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of sexually molesting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally moved, and from time to time he almost screamed and his voice was sticking when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the Committee, saying that the allegations against him were a "grotastic and coordinated character killing" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Mr Pelosi said that she felt that Mr Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was biased to the disadvantage of democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was worried about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade abortion case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation inquiries, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to put up with it.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she talked to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I cry.
I'm angry.'
And so she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to vent anger partly because they are often fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they managed to hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an illegitimate affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for office in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was late out, she was behind with the money collection, promising not to go in as a candidate unless she got $2 million.
It was a project doomed to failure.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she was not going to launch a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice blocked itself.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls in relation to the reactions of the press.
"One could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my tombstone?"
'She cried?'
Why the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The opening door of the US-China trade war was deafening. The war is far from over, but the rift between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on key Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods for $200 billion, which means in practice that half of all goods entering the United States from China are subject to customs duties.
Beijing has responded each time with the same coin; recently, fees of between 5% and 10% were imposed on US goods for USD 60 billion.
China has promised to match US action. The world’s second largest economy is unlikely to degrade in the foreseeable future.
Getting Washington to back down means bowing to demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be far too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war can give positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" for returnees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, which is in ruins after the war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that it did not accept conditional support or help from countries that have supported the uprising.
Europe resigned with victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn’s team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the knock-out on the 16th hole’s par 3 course, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranked players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world’s highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a moved Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
An odd statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing achievement: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve been fighting.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow and bend.
They played better than us."
Algae bloom: The levels decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algal bloom concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
The algae bloom extends along more than 200 km of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about a mile and a half into the sea outside the main municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algal blooms have also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week. Outside the Hillsborough coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida this past week.
