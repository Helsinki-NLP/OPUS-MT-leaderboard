Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
To the Holy Mass for liberation and healing, he draws crowds.
He was ten years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
On the mass celebrated by Father Witko for the liberation and healing of the crowds
He was once visited by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Surprised doctors said: “The operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary activities of the Creator already as a teenager.
In his dreams, the souls of the purgatory came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was happening to the man who committed mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost my human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal,” he says.
An invisible force lifted him up, he could not get his voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“Drunk in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to the human form,” he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a calling in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease participate in the Mass for healing performed by Father Witko.
The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
Kolping's first defeat FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
Today (26 September this year) the afternoon team of Kolping FRAC deservedly succumbed to the current champion of Poland Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
The Yaroslavians in such a personal comparison, which they presented with the citizens of Grodno, have little chance of winning with the Sovereigns of the League.
It was a duel with Darth Bogoria.
The team still lacks Chen Jingqi, the team leader.
Perhaps with him in the composition of Yaroslavl would reach for the third successive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown to win with such aces as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the hall MOSiR at Sikorskiego Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
In both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class on his own.
After three duels, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.
Kou Lei probably beat Mark Badowski, and Daniel G<0xC3><0xB3>rak after an emotional, five-hundredth fight – Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Leia a chance.
You could still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why not?
According to the announcements of Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
"These actions may even result in the detection of individual disease individuals, which may contribute to the aggravation of difficulties in accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result," the authors write.
The decision of the Ministry is not understood by the President of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have foreseen it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are examined, then later they will go to the doctor, which is absurd, because this is about leading to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski.
“I find it hard to imagine that expert specialists say: ‘Let’s not get tested, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, then I am not surprised that the health service is in this state.’
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country’s future government tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, which will arise, proceeds to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” Abbas said.
“It is our duty to defend all of our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences – by engaging fully in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” the Palestinian Authority president, who made similar declarations in July, said in a statement.
Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel, was once again on a mission to form a government after the September 17 election.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he wins, he will announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intends to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements, which were patronized by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold Palestinian general elections on the ground.
The last took place in 2006.
“When I return to the country, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and everyone who opposes them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the rights of “full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations in all respects.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’s speech, saying that the Palestinian leader “prefers to focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority’s efforts against Israel rather than to fight against the calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership.”
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s planned annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators at critical points of Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save lives.
The Voivodeship Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l wants such devices to be in critical points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek W<0xC3><0xB3>jcik are officers of the Subcarpathian Tax Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On August 28, they were serving at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. A customs and tax officer spotted a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, was contacted on September 23 by a Communist Party secretary from her home village to report that her husband had just died at a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
At the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body slaughtered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in blood,” she said.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cell phone with me, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police pressed her to sign a statement saying her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an “unfortunate accident.”
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, the real-world development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR game engine, together with an application enabling the transfer of data by users, a test and training platform for the verification of practical skills in the workplace and professional improvement with the use of VR and AI technologies, and an innovative game simulating the development of field games in the field.
The objective of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, today the Polish video game industry is growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral program, which already reaches PLN 300 million, are an important impetus for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedevu,” the statement reads.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.
“Introduced by the government incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R&D incentives, competency improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR, drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market”, says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin.
The Head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN," the Deputy Prime Minister emphasizes.
The director of the NCBR, Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in the two previous competitions for co-financing with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the III competition and the diversity of applications shown that the video game industry has the ideas and competence to further develop and increase its competitive advantage.
“We are particularly pleased that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects for solutions that serve not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of co-financing of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented within the framework of the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs affiliated to the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among others, companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confesses to stealing Kasper Dolberg’s watch
The event took place on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived in Nice at the end of August from Ajax Amsterdam, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not only that, it’s worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,000.
The next day, the angry Dane did not show up for class, explaining his stomach problems.
The matter was mysterious from the beginning.
Players in the cloakroom have private safes at their disposal, and the club grounds are monitored.
According to the AFP news agency, Diaby-Fadiga finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.
He moved to Nice at the age of 13 and made his first team debut three years later.
He played in seven games this season.
He has recently signed a professional contract, but the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect, according to the L’Equipe newspaper.
So far, he has taken disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that it is necessary to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to wash enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
Most of us wash them less.
It is enough warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
Washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: fingertips (connected or individually) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the second hand, the spaces between the fingers (interlace your hands, rubbing your fingers against each other), thumbs – each finger we embrace with the other hand and in such a moment we turn it around.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet wipe, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from PLN 5).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door handles or doors with washed hands (recommended by the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
Iran’s President Says He Rejected US Talks, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the U.S. during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite a U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the Iranian side had asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have proposed the lifting of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not hold talks under maximum pressure
Iran’s president said he did not agree to hold the talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”
He said he met with U.S. diplomats because he succumbed to the urges of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not hold talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be,” Rouhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States, and he accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a precondition that does not allow” to establish a dialogue.
“If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian side’s request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said “no!” the US president tweeted.
Voltage with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 deal with Iran, to which they were signatories.
In exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran will abandon its nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector will be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.
So far, none of this has worked out.
Washington is using tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has said that if it does not get permission to export raw materials, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in stalking against judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, and therefore there is no reason to support the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not turned into a case against him so far.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the WSA president within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who spoke publicly about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in the hater group, will return to the court and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hater group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for forged screens and the words of his wife, whom he is divorcing.
This is exactly what the other judges associated with the “Casta” claim: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.
Because the prosecutor’s office did not nod a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of the phone Emilia Szmydt, who stopped the phone in June in another case.
The police did not nod to secure the devices of the people whom Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek pointed out as persecutors in a February report.
There is no evidence – there is no Szmydt case, there is no Kasta case.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banasi about renting a tenement to pimps and hiding income.
The CBA checks his property statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Committee of Parliamentary Ethics will not take care of Banasi, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow gathered to make a curious decision to remove Banasi’s deputies and appoint him as his legal assistant, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American novel, I think, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.
She's so stunned and devastated that she can't utter a word.
She stands at the door stunned, and at this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
My husband makes the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is it?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
Only in the case of "Kasta" or Banasia is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>winko in the final of the high jump
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after the maternity break, the bronze medalist of the World Championships from London 2017, in the first attempt defeated 1.85 and 1.89, and in the second 1.92.
1.94 She managed to get only in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I can fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump more technically,” Li<0xC4><0x87>winko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the eliminations, the best were American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik – 1.94 each.
Both players were the only ones not to lose any height.

Beginning at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in a serious condition
He went to the hospital, and doctors described his condition as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will come out, that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover,” said Kornel Morawiecki, an anonymous close person, in an interview with journalists of the “Super Express”.
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
“I am being held in my life by my closest family and politicians,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to Super Express journalists two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw for research.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When the CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer,” the father of the prime minister said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MIA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don’t have metastasis.
I don’t know if I’m going to get chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of doctors specialists who are rather good-natured.
For now, after this difficult operation, I have to return to some state of usability.
I hope everything will be all right,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with SE in January.
“If I were to give up too late, the situation would be tragic and I would say goodbye to that paddle already,” he added.

Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blonde hair and gray-blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, gray pants and shoes.

The power of oval jumps.
The title of the amateur sports competition, which took place on Sunday afternoon, September 15, at the hippodrome on Oleandry Street in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, may be misleading for some.
The road to true power is a long way off, but this is what is called one of the types of horse competition...
The power of jumping competition consists in overcoming by the rider and horse ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long and still unbroken world record, established in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not among the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle” were a demonstration part of the “Rainbow Riding Competitions” that were held there a little earlier, which we write more extensively in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
The competition was joined by eight amazons, who trained riding in the O<0xC5><0x82>awa JKS.
Four competed on bitches and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szoldra was the best, riding the crazy “Sprinter”.
This small but dynamic rum began by overcoming obstacles spread out at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he suspended from further competition by the jury of the competition.
The second place in the pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who sat “Famy”, and the third by Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> on “Harmider”.
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the starting Amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Terrible-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who sat on the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode on the “Flight”.
Fortunately, apart from minor breaks, nothing bad happened to the Amazons or horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mare "Vineta" on the parker had her sitting Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uckiewicz.
You needed either a coach’s assistant or another horse for the couple, behind which a little crazy “Vineta” snarled.
After completing the obstacle from the parkour, she also went down in full swing, so it became dangerous at times in the boxes and on the stretcher. "Everything is under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a little by these frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
From the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska, who sat down beautifully presenting "Whisky", performed great on the park.
This dignified mare, coupled with an experienced Amazonian, was the first to jump 135 cm in the final phase and this was the best result of the competition at that time.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also scored the same height on the "Declaration", Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uckiewicz on the "Vineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on the "Flight".
For flo decoration and after receiving the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment all these competitors went together, and at the end together with the Amazons on ponytails in the tact of the Radecki march they made an impressive honorary round, ending with this interesting and exciting competition.
Thank you.
The Riding Sports Club “W Siodle” cordially thanks the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the 16th “Rainbow Riding Competitions”: the Municipal Office in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the Waterworks and Sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the District Mayor’s Office and the “Mustang” company.
Max Kolonko cuts off from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonka’s #R Revolution political formation was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko himself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has terminated cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect the WWW to delete my name from my name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the above-mentioned entity," he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who is in the United States, announced the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on the YouTube portal, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’re tired of politicians, tired of your stupid games, tired of your amateur governments.
It is time for the people to take power in the country and rule for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
The party’s agenda included, among others, issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalisation of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to the Eastern flank states of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions eventually came to fruition.
UBS: Gold close to the equilibrium point
“The euro exchange rate will continue in the coming months at around PLN 4.35, accompanied by a weak global market situation,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak for stabilizing the zloty’s quotations at the current ceiling,” the expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
“While the zloty is properly valued – euro quotations should continue in the coming months around the PLN 4.35 ceiling – Polish bonds are not attractive, according to him.
Much more advantageous yields than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets,” says Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation for Emerging Markets in UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
“The global slowdown may deepen, but it should not lead to a severe recession, and at most to a drop in GDP dynamics just below zero,” Bolliger said.
Investors should ignore global stocks that may be harmed by the lack of prospects for a US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment and Brexit.
Europe should be relatively the weakest among the stock markets," according to the latest investor letter by UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.
“Action from the euro area countries should behave worse than the US, because it is more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowing down,” the document says.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of the German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the long run, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, thanks to the easing of the monetary policy of banks.
The Fed has the biggest margin for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.
The long-term equilibrium point for euro quotes is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the single currency against the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed’s rates, which will lead to a decrease in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
“The long-term strength of the dollar may not be sustained by current and budget deficits,” Bolliger said.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, according to a confidential statement prepared by the German defense ministry.
This was reported by the press of the media group RedactionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of Parliamentary Secretary of State Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3,474 ammunition have been recovered so far.
Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3, 11 G3, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
Martina Renner, vice-president of the Left Party, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “wonderful”.
Moreover, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “poor balance sheet”.
She also criticized the fact that the list does not indicate whether there are weapons that were found during the investigation against Lieutenant of the Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The officer was accused of plotting attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.
His “black list” of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party, and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally acquired four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on a plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently used a feature designed for people for whom traveling with a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of seats on the plane.
If a minor travels up to the age of two, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or carers.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place away from the one occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the airlines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a last-minute change in the aircraft.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids. We used to be kids.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we’ll need a map of sitting places for mouth-breathing, salivating, or drunk,” Sundar wrote.
Another Internet user noted that he was once disturbed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me of screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca loses money after bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on holiday to Mallorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.
According to the representative of the Balearic autonomous government Marc Pons, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Mallorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Mallorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, because Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government has already begun negotiations with international operators on "entering the Mallorca market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The Diario de Mallorca newspaper estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Mallorca.
About 800 are the dismissed employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the insolvency of Thomas Cook in several hotels in Majorca, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional nightly fee.
This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had suspended operations at least until the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and the companies cooperating with him.
The diary Diario de Ibiza on Friday said most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that worked with the Thomas Cook Group were not in a position to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Mallorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is behind local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019, about 5 million euros.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland is still in 29th place, the US is at the forefront
The women’s national team of Poland occupies the 29th place in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous July ranking.
Weak staff matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were American women, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third place was held by the Dutch.
Polish women are preparing for the qualification of ME.
They were supposed to start with the away match against the Czechs on 3 September.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of opponents, it was postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Polish women will inaugurate the qualification with a meeting with the Spanish women on November 12 in Lublin.
Previously, “White-Red” will play two friendly matches – on October 3 on departure from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, the rivals of the Poles are the national teams of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Group winners and top three teams from second places advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barracks for the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host - England.
Poland's men's national team in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog crushed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are low, and coal furnaces will pile up this winter as if nothing ever happened,” reads the front page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
“So far, 82 thousand applications for co-financing worth PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The accepted applications amount to a total of more than PLN 915 million, “Rz” reports, citing data from the spokesperson of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper notes, only part of the costs incurred are refunded from the program.
The results of the announced roaring program are rated by the journal as "modest".
The local government, quoted by “Rz”, sees the failures of “Clean Air”, among others, in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by mail, possible random check of implementation.
This would improve the operation," says Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski, Mayor of Lidzbark Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the target of replacing 3 million kicking boilers was achieved.
As “Rz” notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year, PLN 1.4 billion has been booked,” reads the report.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Now the price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but it is not the end of our work,” Mariusz B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” the Polish minister added.
The Polish F-35
The Polish air force will eventually supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The investment will support U.S. national security and foreign policy by improving the security of a NATO ally that is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the delivery of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics and program support elements and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II produced by Lockheed Martin is a fifth-generation single-seat and single-engine multi-role fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombing and typically hunting air combat tasks.
Thanks to stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Belgium recently bought F-35 fighter jets under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also expected to consider buying U.S. combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender Dolls
Producer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
This is how we fight stereotypes.
Barbie introduces a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with a different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the series "Creatable World" wear wigs.
Therefore, children can decide whether their Barbie is to have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can turn into boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
They also refused to emphasize the characteristic sexual characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a slim waist or – in the case of Ken – wide shoulders.
The company believes that children don’t like having their dolls enforced gender norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a specific sex inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel said.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in swimsuits and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The group has reacted to the criticism and has already launched dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also puppets in the hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club Together can have a dozen deputies
Zandberg, asked on ZET radio how many candidates his party can get into the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the letter starts the candidates to the Sejm SLD, Spring and the Left Together, starting with the joint logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people have hope that the Left is not only right, but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 seats.
“This may mean that the circle or the club together will have a dozen or so members.
But it depends on the Poles and Poles.
I will not guess and say how it will happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by being different, we were able to agree on a common program.”
When asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, when he noted that the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, he replied that "the goal of the political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
When it comes to the Senate elections, he said he was thinking.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates in this offer to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further away,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the Senate District 44, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I don’t think I would be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (the KO-PAP candidate),” he added.
In this district, outside Ujazdowski, the leaders of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start.
Dakar: Largest mosque in West Africa opens
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived on buses, cars and on foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, which can accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, donated by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque ("Roads to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, revered by worshippers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque inside will accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the second one can be on the outer esplanade.
In richly finished interiors, you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and handmade decorations by Moroccan workers.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building is not comparable to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, provided lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smyla: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a victory, the players of the Crown will try to break in Friday's meeting with the runner-up of the extra-league Silesia.
“Our problem is not the Wroc<0xC5><0x82>awians, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” said Kielce coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a.
The players of the Crown last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when at the exit they defeated 1:0 Benjaminka of the game Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa Cancers.
Later, the Kielce recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Zag<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am very optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the turf after the last whistle did not result from the collapse, only it was a fall of anger, because they were so close," Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” the coach added.
Ognjen Gnjatic will certainly not play in the match in Korona on Friday, and Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be injured.
However, it is edifying to apply to the cup match of several players with a desire to play.
“We have a headache, it just seemed like he wasn’t going to be there, and now he is,” Smyla said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the extra-class anyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks, we may not be showing it on the pitch, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday.”
After nine queues of the Extra-Class Crown with the achievement of five points takes the 15th position.
<0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk has accumulated 12 more and is in second place.
Friday’s match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees could disappear completely from Europe
“42% of European tree species are endangered,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red Book of European Trees, published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnut trees and dachshunds.
The IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was prepared by specialists who, based on the research, concluded that out of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as in other parts of the world), 42% are “highly endangered”.
Among the reasons, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
According to IUCN experts, 58% of species are at risk of extinction, and 15%, or 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of the tree stand, accelerated urbanization, excessive tree felling, and subsequently forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also severely threatened.
“Human activities lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and pose a risk of extinction in Europe of important and undervalued varieties that underlie European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,” concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European office of IUCN.
I don't think I'll give you 600+.
“Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan distribution for their freedom, which future generations will have to pay off,” Grzegorz Schetyna told Rzeczpospolita in an interview.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is pic.”
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away.”
In an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz, Schetyna assures that she has an idea for defeating Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski’s party.
“Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than there are supporters of the PiS, a party that has betrayed its proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the president of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.
"First of all, nothing of the data will be received, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, as can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about “launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that in the KO program there is a project that will give the least earning Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners by several hundred.
The politician also noted that he does not want to race for the distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he does not promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition on the distribution, until finally the financial collapse of the country took place,” he stressed.
In an interview with Rz, Schetyna also stated that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“Pride walks before fall.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski is such a statesman as Banas is a crystal,” he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether to apply for the chairmanship of the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead condors
Six dead large condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes, or wild dogs.
The animals may have eaten a toxic carcass.
Apart from one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It’s a big loss to the environment, because the condor has to reach 10-15 years of age to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing a protected species, a threatened species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentinian environmental organization.
“I think that the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species in danger, but all other life forms, including human health,” he adds.
RZ: They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by the law firm of Andrzej Duda – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
According to the newspaper, it is a golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic during the interwar period.
It was probably last used by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to begin work on amending the law on orders and decorations in order to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of the state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time the work is fast.
At the beginning of August, the senators spent a few minutes on the matter, believing that they would consult the Office of the President.
This came in mid-September.
“I kindly inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not submit any comments on the position presented in this petition,” said the President’s Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The office of the President has replied to us briefly: it is in favour of restoring this," said the head of the commission, Robert Mam<0xC4><0x85>tow of PiS, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a request for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through a crossroads
The police action will be carried out, among others, at the crossroads of al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski from al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski.
Uniform activities are related to the recent complaints of the city authorities against drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w, the “Transitional Crossings”.
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering a crossroads without the possibility of exit, not complying with light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, but in fact we are making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, the city’s vice president, a few days ago.
His words came at a press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars along the intersections, which in turn creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster driving on lights or not writing SMS while driving.
The subject was taken over by the Rzeszow police, who are starting the “Transitional Crossings” action from today.
What's going on?
The aim of the activities is to eliminate the phenomenon of restriction of cruising on intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
This is a frequent offense that contributes to the aggravation of traffic jams and the creation of traffic jams.
He is threatened with a fine of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and improper parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late starting from below the beacons, slow crossing of crossings and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At what intersections will actions be carried out?
Among others, at Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellonian Street; Al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; Targowa Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; <0xC5><0x9A>reniawit<0xC3><0xB3>w Square from D<0xC4><0x85>browski Street or Hetmanska Street from Powsta<0xC5><0x84>c<0xC3><0xB3>w Street from Warsaw Street.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be held on the next Fridays of October.
They inspected the company that disposed of the waste from the “Czajka”
“Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski District and the District Construction Supervision Inspectorate inspected the installation in Zielonka on Friday, in which waste from the Czajka wastewater treatment plant in Warsaw is disposed of,” said Karol Szyszko, spokesman for the Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski mayor’s office.
Inspectors from the Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski mayor's office carried out an inspection in the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
“Dar-Trans” Private Trade and Transport Plant, under the agreement with the capital sewage treatment plant “Czajka” performs wastewater management services.
“The installation was inspected and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
He added that the post-audit report will be submitted, among others, to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then determined that the company did not carry out sampling, measurement and groundwater testing, and also did not have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka sewage treatment plant.
After the inspection of WIO<0xC5><0x9A>, Dariusz Sobota was called on to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka treatment plant.
In accordance with the decision to carry out waste disposal on the site, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STOO<0xC5><0x9A> was decommissioned, which was associated with the damage to one of the incinerator facilities.
According to the MPWiK, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me," said the candidate of the Civic Coalition for Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now “only a pensioner”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met on Friday with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk.
A short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa’s son, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“You have taken on a difficult task,” Lech Walesa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems facing Poland are familiar to all of us.
Therefore, there is great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible,” the former president said, addressing Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very important words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked for the support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution and knows how important it is,” she said.
“Let’s show that you can do a different, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said.
The Retirement Party
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told reporters that he is now "only a retired fan".
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope we reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to this) we will return.
The three divisions of power are the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are indispensable.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal operation, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we have a street criterion,” said Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa.
“That is why it is so important for Poles to go to the elections, think and make their own decision.
And that is the most important thing,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska added.
“This is the last chance that we will improve the situation in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “Mr. President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no power-sharing, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move a single step forward.
ME volleyball players: Slovenia – Poland 3-1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot terrain in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The White and Reds lost 1-3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has passed key laws.
The Senate passed without amendments the law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
52 senators voted for the amendment of the law on the property of state officials’ families – without amendments – 14 voted against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments submitted during Wednesday's debate by PO Senator S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were supposed to “civilize” the law and limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the financial situation of their own children, children of the spouse, children prepared for cases in which children remain in the joint household with the person obliged to make the statement.
The Act on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was created in the office of the Prime Minister, was adopted by the Sejm on September 11.
The regulations stipulate that, among others, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons who are at the head of other state institutions will be obliged to include in the statement of property information about the remaining spouses and children.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government planes along with the most important people in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted in favour of the bill, 12 against it, and four abstained.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight “performed on an official mission”.
During the flight, the President will be able to be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
The flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight “to carry out tasks directly related to the function”.
The law also specifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft - invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.
According to the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate office of the impossibility of organizing such a flight.

Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play in the match for the bronze medal on Saturday.
Vitala Heynen's wards were closed by Thursday's 1:3 defeat against the Slovenes in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their troubles with the trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they trained in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the reports of the people present in the class, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was more about spending it together than training.
“To talk, to think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to earth.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We always thought we would come back to this game.
We discussed this match with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main reasons for failure, I would point out ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect,” he said.
In his opinion, the “White and Red” did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted that the world champions could be put to sleep a little smooth way to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group stage, we would have been quicker to analyze the lesson and otherwise play in the later stage of the tournament.
But it's just a prank," he remarked.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat will turn the Poles into aggression in the match for bronze.
“I hope that we will show our true face.
There's a lot to fight about.
We won the medal in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during this championship.
In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two meetings of the group stage, and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player was given a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine in a six-month suspension for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgios, but they are still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the misdeeds of the most untamed professional tennis player of recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks of break plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which the untamed athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he’s been on a rampage for a long time and has earned a tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and the audience, breaking two rockets during the losing match with Karen Khachanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113,000 dollars.
He also did not play for long in the US Open 2019, but managed to publicly say that ATP activists are “corrupt”, which hurt the authorities of the organization so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict about the suspension of the launches and another fine.
However, he was forgiven for speaking about corruption after hearing the accused and learning the context of the statement.
In a statement, tennis activists said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behavior over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted in a vulgar way people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence a high punishment.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering him to fulfill several conditions in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct in force for professional tennis players, in particular, can no longer curse, destroy with missiles, destroy with rockets.
He was also recommended to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and also consult with people specializing in solving the problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment to the verdict was, “Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as his shoulder injury intensified in the Lavera Cup, so he had to give up the next races in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).
In the ATP ranking, Kyrgios ranks 27th.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines, he still has a lot of money left.
GUS: Poland is getting better and better
According to the report on household budgets published by GUS on Friday, 44 percent of them rated their financial situation as good or rather good in the UB.
The previous year, the percentage was 37.2 percent, in 2016 it was 33.5 percent, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30 percent.
A total of 8.1 per cent of households considered their financial situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2 per cent a year earlier and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of self-employed people.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the second pole are pensioners’ households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a large impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is for parents who raise their offspring alone, of whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good financial situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ program.
Before it was launched (in 2016), single parents and large families (with at least three children) assessed their worst financial situation.
The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good, increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodeships, there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of material conditions of households.
The best estimates are formulated by residents of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Then there are Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazovian (47.3%) and West Pomeranian (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average, and in Lubuskie it was 98%.
The highest incomes were given to residents of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average, in Poland, disposable income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also hampers spending growth.
Those per person amounted to PLN 1,187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9%, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1 percent of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80 percent, and by 2006 it exceeded 90 percent.

US: Three suicides among the crew of the aircraft carrier
Three sailors committed suicide aboard the USS George H.W. Bush last week, the US Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of the ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year and the previous one in November of 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush was docked off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties has been excluded.
Deaths are not related to each other.
“We need everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
"I want to emphasize that there is no stigmatization or other repercussions associated with seeking help," the ship's commander, Captain Sean Bailey, wrote on Facebook.
Critically speaking about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski stressed that in 1981, John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“Each of his opinions was accepted.”
There was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II could not eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activities is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way even during the life of Pope Polak,” he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were murmurings of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, he once did not accept Rydzyk, but he had the power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, as did his successors,” explained Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
“Beyond this came the fatal issue of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their lack.
I was thinking a little bit ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," he said in an interview with the journalist Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
In the opinion of the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of the PiS.
“It must be admitted that in the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the festivities began with Holy Mass, crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are Pisan, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the Pisan regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it, and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay,” said Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
“I hope that Pope Francis is chasing J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he concluded.
Tomorrow's celebrations of the 590th anniversary of the county
There will be gala concerts and auctions.
The jubilee gala will be held in Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w House of Culture.
First, at 10 a.m., in the church of St. Nicholas, the Mass will begin.
The official opening of the ceremony will take place at 11.30 in HDK.
The Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w Land Song and Dance Ensemble will perform.
Young people from Stanis<0xC5><0x82>aw Staszic’s I LO will present a spectacle entitled “Rubieszowski District: Hence my family – here I live”.
Then medals will be awarded “Deserved for the County of Grubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w”.
At 4 p.m. the event will be moved to the city promenade, where the concerts "Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w Charitable for Angelika Zi<0xC5><0x84>kiewicz" will be held.
They will play disco polo bands – NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and the star of the evening Mig.
There will be auctions, including pens and porcelain of the President of the Council of Ministers.
The PZPN is throwing punishments for the riots in the stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The Polish Cup match between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk did not end tragically when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, passed the race launched by fans from Wejherowo by millimeters.
After the incident, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating this case has imposed a severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future matches.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will not be able to play in groups until 31 December.
Burdy at the Widzewa <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> stadium also caused fans of Silesia Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.
Despite this, the services allowed the <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> fans to be thrown with ducks, to set fire to chairs and to force the host sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The ban also covered the Ekstraklasa league matches, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange markings across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, recording the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodeship, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the towns in neighboring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the changes we have prepared in the law, they will finally appear on the road signs along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the Carpathian section of the A4 motorway,” said Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand z<0xC5><0x82>.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned until November 1, 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
There will be no replacement of plates, on the basis of inserts.
They will replace the existing town names with new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great help for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windmill.
In a pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had made a target of the animal – a shot from a windmill was found in his body.
“The information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sola.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately clear that something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first X-ray was taken, it was already known that someone had made a firewall out of it.
There were shrapnel fragments in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation centre.
Overwinters at the resort
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water was provided, a safe place in the center where he would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He is not able to fly yet.
To release him now would mean that he would most likely not survive the winter,” Walasek added.
Staff after undergoing rehabilitation of the swan intends to release him in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice municipality, after receiving information about the cause of the animal’s poor health, intend to inform the prosecutor’s office about the case.
The event took place in Zameczno
Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish small trade”
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, the leader of the Agreement Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin.
During a conversation in “Signals of the Day” in radio station Jednica, Gowin stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot grow.
Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received “contras from the EC”.
“We won in front of the justice court and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates a government, then we will return to this topic,” he said.
At the same time, he noted that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade”.
"On top of that, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognizing that the Polish retail tax was an unlawful public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 percent of revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 percent of revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was supposed to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission launched a procedure for violation of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered as public aid.
It then concluded that the tribute had been implemented in an unlawful manner.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until the completion of its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
An EU court decision in May paved the way for the re-introduction of the tax, but did not finalise the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the CJEU press service informed the PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing, will start.
It takes a good few to several months from the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“This procedure lasts an average of a year,” a source at the Luxembourg tribunal told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer a few practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important ceremony in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion at which the whole family gathers around the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that the freshly baked mom and dad want their consolation to look the best on this day.
However, before you make a final decision about the child’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores you can find many outfits that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, several weeks old babies were baptized, arranged in white sets and put into the same drums or large pillows.
Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: several months old, one year old, and even older.
It is not difficult to guess that such a great consolation needs a little different clothing for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, it is likely that the ceremony will be held in a wheelchair or in the hands of parents or godparents.
The best way out will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a casual outfit, it is enough to look for its festive variants, for example, with a falbank or lace.
Ideal for a boy will be a body with a print of flies and shells.
In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of girls eagerly look towards richly decorated, fluffy dresses for baptism, complete with coats, bands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, applications and cute sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a small gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys, there was a fashion for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collars or caskets often made young elegance loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been pushed out by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, jersey shorts, and also a blouse decorated at the front on the pattern of a vest.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not obstruct the movements of the familiar toddler.
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz published a property statement
Krystyna Pavlovich made a statement of assets at the end of the term.
It follows from it that the MP PiS has accumulated 110,000 zlotys of savings.
Recall that Pavlovich announced his resignation from politics.
At the end of his term, he has $110,000.
According to the statement made by the MP, she receives a pension of PLN 4.7 thousand per month.
Pavlovich owns an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and a slightly smaller one, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also published a statement of assets.
Voting on a break during the Conservative Party conference
British lawmakers voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party’s annual programme conference, as requested by the government.
289 MPs voted in favour, 306 against.
Generally, the House of Commons does not meet during party conferences, so that members do not have to resign either from participation in them or from parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties agreed that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before Britain's planned departure from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not interrupt the meeting.
289 MPs voted in favour of the government's request for a break, 306 voted against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
Failure to agree to a break can be seen as a political revenge of the opposition against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was found by the Supreme Court to be unlawful and imminent) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the judges’ decision.
Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with Johnson’s speech and the subsequent turbulent debate being the most important event of the day.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“The time has come to implement Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on the priorities of citizens, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit must be implemented so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to begin in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday, October 2.
Conferences of two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications Johnson gave for such a lengthy suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” foreign media reported.
The president's spokesman has strongly denied these reports.
“It’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, say that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, said in February that “Poles sucked anti-Semitism out of their mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against Polish Ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, “Pole, Pole.”
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
This is simply not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalski, the portal “invented it”.
According to the interlocutors of “JI” during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda’s words and say it was the Jews from Israel “like Israel Kac” who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the portal, Boteach was supposed to interrupt the speech of Mosberg.
Who is Banas and what did he do?
The tenement house rented by pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Marian Banasi.
We are summing up another affair that shook the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Supervizijera” journalists have revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered a 400-meter-tall tenement house located in Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w’s Podg<0xC3><0xB3>rze in recent years.
Moreover, his sub-tenant was supposed to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenant house (and therefore rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has allegedly been a collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the anomalies in the Superviser program.
The journalist revealed that since Banasia, the tenement house was rented by people associated with the criminal world, to use it as a place of “erotic meetings”.
Clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Ban<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> responded vaguely and vaguely to the charges.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Banasi.
The building itself was vaguely described in them, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.
“The property of Marian Banasi and his wife may be worth from 6 to 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]”, writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia building itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently auditing Marian Banasi’s property statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that he would suspend his activities in NIK until its completion. “I will speak to your marshal for free,” he assured.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the investigation of Marian Banasi’s property statements.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over the state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Mariusz Witczak, PO-KO MP.
“If a normal Pole had so blatantly low-valued the rental of his property, he would have already 10 controls, tax domicile and criminal-tax proceedings,” he added.
He went high, he fell low.
Marian Bana<0xC5><0xA1> is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was submitted by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were accepted.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK in 1992-2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first PiS governments (2005–2008), Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served as the President of the Customs Service and also as Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
From 2015 he again sat on the chair of the head of the Customs Service, and from 2017 he managed the National Tax Administration.
Banas served for 3 months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a police officer's order will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregard for an order for specific conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The police union wants this change.
The idea came to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million criminal cases are referred to Polish courts,” reads the report.
“Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police Officers writes to MPs on the change of the code of offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read: “Whoever does not submit to the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, shall be liable to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who, by not following orders, prevent or impede the performance of a service activity,” the daily reports.
The sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political affairs of the demonstrations.
“In situations of libertarian demonstrations, this would be unfavourable and instead of easing the situation, even exacerbating it,” he added.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed the police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
J<0xC3><0xA1>chym Topol's writing is in my blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in one row with V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
J<0xC3><0xA1>chym, therefore, had from the beginning a curse of talent, which he was trying to use.
Eight years later, he returned with “The Sensitive Man.”
The protagonists are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a together with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are migratory actors, they travel around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys did not make a sound from birth, and for the other time stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
They are all just a background for observing a world where there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It’s a world of busy provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and slutty young people.
“Sensitive Man” turns into an absurd theater.
The narrative mimics didascalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is in operation.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared three Belgian daughter companies bankrupt: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
As early as Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company is now “fully operational” despite the British company’s mother’s bankruptcy, which has raised concerns among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that customers who bought tours in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world, declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company earn an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

“I don’t think Slovenia played fantastically.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was prepared for the visitors of the German Görlitz.
Actions are to help combat the progressive decline in the number of residents of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is struggling with significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which resulted in a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it was 54 thousand people.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received for the programme.
Two-thirds of them were residents of large cities.
The program was also interested in people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
“When we applied, we thought the program was meant to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get the opinion of the participants of the program.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what was their motivation,” said Robert Knippschild, who is in charge of the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
