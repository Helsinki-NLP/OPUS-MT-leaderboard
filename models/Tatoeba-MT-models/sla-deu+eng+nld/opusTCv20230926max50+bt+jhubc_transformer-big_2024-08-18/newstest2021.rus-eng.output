Semilarski v. Prosecutor’s Office: the cassation of the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski’s claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since its resolution was not within the competence of the administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
“These issues should be regulated by the prosecutor’s office and the district court,” the Tartu Courts spokeswoman Anette Creutzmann told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the state will have to say its word.
According to defense attorney Semilarski, Oliver Nees’s juror, his client had been unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands from the prosecutor’s office to refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for the moral damages.
The reason for filing a complaint to the court were the statements of the prosecutor in special cases of the Lyuna district prosecutor Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the other Vice Mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
“When I was arrested, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu – one of the most influential bodies of local self-government – were corrupt.
These public suspicions that hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarski said in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neas, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The allegation of bribery and bribery turned out to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, state representatives should be careful in choosing the words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before the sentencing.
The prosecutor’s office is obliged to do so by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Nees said.
“The public perception of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant,” the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, the former Vice Mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be brought to justice on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated in the meetings of the city administration more than thirty times in making decisions related to the companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarsky actively communicated on a personal level during non-working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor’s office presented Semilarsky suspicions of receiving a bribe and violation of anti-corruption legislation in conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained together with another Deputy Mayor Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
The prosecutor’s office and the security police said there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached a court that fully justified the policy.
The Valvo Semilarski investigation is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally the next historical minimum.
Judging by the return of the short step of lowering the rate, as well as the tonality of the Central Bank’s statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing may soon stop.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, primarily given that the risks of inflation deflation still remain down from 4% in 2021,” said Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, the annual rate of decrease in the turnover of transport, industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the contraction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (before this, 4-6% was expected), and the recovery of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $ 27 and $ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of easing, say economists for Russia and the CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia consistently lowers the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer, it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once due to low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also points to a close pause in interest-policy easing – disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
In addition, the Bank of Russia’s subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev said.

During the workshop, which was held today, July 24, the Government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of development of remote agricultural territories.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Ordyn Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The order for this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has managed to move from a dead end.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
Deadline for delivery of the building is 2022.
And this year, the school in the village of Bayandai should be commissioned.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the program of construction of facilities of preschool and secondary education is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, - said the Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the work on the development of general plans of settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also during the conversation, a problem was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant-farmer farms.
Because of this, the share of receipt of products from cooperatives decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the place, to study the structure of milk sales, to analyze the experience of other territories and to determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, the landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern waste treatment complexes.
But this option is not possible for every polygon - many of them overgrown with dense residential development.
After the polygon is closed, it stands up for reclamation - the body of the polygon is overflowing with soils, systems of degassing and infiltration are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit odors, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to rise a useless pile among the surrounding residential buildings.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the site "Annino" just recently ended, the authorities are considering the option of making a pile of ski slopes.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto long ago already clogged with garbage.
"Some time will pass, the polygon will "saddle", will gain strength, and we will think what can be done to make it begin to benefit.
Directly catches the eye - the ski resort," - said the head of the Ruz district Nikolay Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources
"Torbeevo" landfills in Lyubertsy and "Timokhovo" in the Bogorodsky district will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
In the territory of "Torbeev" by the end of the year will be launched gas piston power plant, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide its own needs of the landfill - heat supply of administrative and production facilities.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
A museum can be created at the Kuchino balashikhinsky test site, which was closed after complaints from residents on the Direct Line with the President of the country.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum for the reclamation of landfills in the Moscow region," - said the Deputy Prime Minister - the Minister of ecology and environmental management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful tall minarets only adorned Aya-Sofia
Once again about Aya-Sofia - got the text of Father Vladimir Zelinsky, that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First of all, there was a free entrance - hurray!
I haven’t been to Istanbul, but it’s better to have free entrance to the House of God than paid entrance.
Secondly, the Muslims just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oksa inter-river, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give it all back to everyone?
Do you think that there will be no pagans who will demand to return their temple, in the place of which the Tenth Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested funds in it.
That is, it is theirs, as well as the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie into their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They’ve improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it’s all their progressors.
Beautiful tall minarets very adorned Aya-Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid ink, there was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” or “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of a British Foreign Office official, Toynbee, who is ashamed to think so.
Everywhere there is a place of prayer for believers.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave; he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're the dolls, not the grim-stones.

The decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA.
President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that expanding the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams is currently wrong.

I knew that Bryant’s self-love could not be disturbed by some thrash stream, so as not to stimulate his sporting anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the pitch I tried to talk him out of taking the game aggressively.
I gave him compliments on the stage: "Oh!
Kobe, good score, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot about the fact that you need to once again take the ball and score another 3-4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi," Kirilenko said, quoting "Evening Moscow."

"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in total admiration for the fact that there was a legend next to me, which I only saw on TV.

Degtyarev was surprised by the information on the purchase of gas "Sakhalin-1" for dollars
The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Soviet Havana was surprised that the region is buying Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas, for dollars.
American gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
“To be honest, I didn’t know that, and I’m in such a knockdown because of this information.
I had no idea that this was still possible in 2020 in Russia,” he told RIA Novosti.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Russian Energy Ministry Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will switch to supply Russian thermal power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles “at normal prices” will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a production-sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the project operator with a 30% share, another 20% from Rosneft, Sodeco 30% from Japan and ONGC 20% from India.
The Khabarovsk Territory has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor of the Russian TV series responded to the accusations of “LGBT propaganda and feminism”
The actor of the Russian TV series “Chiki”, whose creators were accused of “propaganda of LGBT and feminism”, responded to the claims to the film.
The authors “understood the severity of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,” said the American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication “The Rise”.
“It seems to me that this is a story about the power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the boy’s father, who dressed in women’s clothing.
He stressed that he is “proud of the work” and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep drunk shot the set and said that all this is not true."
“Then there were a couple of cases where we met disgruntled locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came with the claims began to help us,” he summed up.
The shooting occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a car with a gun, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor on the service more.tv, which posted the Russian TV series "Chiki".
Baranec accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of unconventional sexual relations and feminism", drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama Chiki tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
