Novak helped Trabzonspor to the second place, also hit <0xC5><0xA0>koda
Defendant Filip Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k helped score in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2–1 on the Kayserispore field and kept the third Besiktas behind.
Attacker Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda after the January transfer from Slavia already gave the tenth goal for Rizespor, who saved himself, even though he lost 1-3 on the Fenerbahce field.
Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k confirmed on the defender excellent productivity with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of the Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer kicked the ball into the net from an angle.
The home team managed five minutes before the end of the match, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the setup brought the victory to their side, having successfully finished the break four to one.
<0xC5><0xA0>koda at the start of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after the solo at 1:1.
Rizespor did not hold the indecisive state for a long time, but he did not regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents he remained three points above the downhill zone.
The competition will end with a Sunday duel of Basaksehir champions at the Kasimpasa field.
The well-hidden cave near the hermit in the forests of Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor was not really inhabitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa, in the forests through which the Hrab<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD> cesta led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and artificially created.
And we'll go after the human hand created.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, or rather a sheltering chamber, apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock outpost and accessible by stairs from above.
However, until the last minute, it is practically not visible.
It is revealed by a narrow staircase leading to a rock gallery, from where it enters the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far away from human dwellings, at the time of its creation it could have been on a plateau, where today is a forest, a field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window and even the traditional place of the fireplace clearly proves that no hermit could never survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench at the back, which is probably used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek.
On the walls of the cave are visible traces of tools.
Breaking the sandstone with a spike was quite simple and quick for the consecrated.
It was enough to use the joints appropriately and gradually break the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail on the tip and the method of cutting in general, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to historians, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, sometimes someone sleeps there in these days.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are attracted by a flowing stream under the cave and a nearby Count's Trail, you will surely find the path down too.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k is in artificial sleep after a hard fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best of hands now.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This makes it much easier for me to take care of my daughter Finja,” said Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k’s wife Katja.
"Everyone's doing their best, Philip needs time to recuperate now.
There is no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient and give him time," the 45-year-old's wife said.
Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, also called for the financial support of the injured Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, thus levelling the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been collected on Gofundme.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee took football players Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola players in the Saturday match in Naples got four times the ball into the opponent's goal, but in the end they had to come to terms with the defeat 0: 2.
None of their goals were conceded by the referee after consultation with the video due to the offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record disadvantage of the technology, so many interventions have never failed VAR to one team.
“VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no other team.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Sassuola's unrecognized goals.
VAR has never been so strict on a team," Corriere dello Sport added.
Naples took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
However, the goal of Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> was not recognized after the intervention of the video arbitrator due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s further intervention and hits by Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not apply.
The home team added another goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the most recharged in history
"The growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Chmel<0xC3><0xAD>k, head of the clean technologies department at CEZ.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of Tesla electric cars, but also the supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are reporting their share in the market.
Operators of classic filling stations are represented by MOL.
It has no numbers yet.
"We started building our electric mobility network only last year," said Jana Juskov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company's spokeswoman.
However, the daily’s editorial board exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric racks operated by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
According to them, drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about one hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Excluding small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling was then carried out in a free tariff.
If motorists already paid for the subscription, their typical spending was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five most loaded chargers of the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which with their popularity will overshadow the entire regional cities.
Then Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border area, for example in Bohum<0xC3><0xAD>n or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey by the Daily Czech on the Move, 8% of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more robust approach.
The event, titled The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have people here, for example, who have long been against the expansion of the Turov mine, there are people here who are against the extraction of gravel near Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Ostroh, there are people here who are against the construction of meaningless dams," said Marika Wolfov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to retain water in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and the system of subsidies to promote sustainable agriculture and a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
“The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not the reckless and devastating business,” she said.
On Malostranské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> (Malostranské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>) there was a stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring the Czech land and landscape.
Present people were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The end of the canola dumplings" or "Less coal, more chopsticks".
Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda from the Za voda for people association came from South Moravia to Prague, protesting against the plan to extract gravel in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region.
“It puts 140,000 people at risk of drinking water,” he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned extraction of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to reports, the water quality will be threatened.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in the Karlovy Vary region for the so-called agroecological farmers.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms, which do not marry for income and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, on top of which they will not do such damage to the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died in plane crash on house in Germany
An ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in western Germany on Monday, killing three people and injuring two others.
According to local rescue services, there are probably two crew members and one resident of the house among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The loft apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, was subsequently engulfed by fire.
Firefighters have managed to get the flames under control.
The deputy commander of the local fire department, Robert Meyboom, said that both crew members of the plane had died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote in an appeal to the mayor of Wesel that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
Near the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police say it comes from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot-air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane had collapsed in the air before hitting the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech Savings Bank incorrectly charged some card payments twice.
He has removed the error.
On Saturday afternoon, <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna incorrectly charged some card payments to its clients twice.
Bank spokesman Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k said the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The bank has already corrected the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with doubled card payments were recorded by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
“Yesterday (Saturday) at night we performed an update of the system and all these double payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At the moment, everything works without problems," said Kropik on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the bank’s spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, there were fewer thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are investigated by the savings bank.
"It could be a combination of several factors," said Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, there were 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch on Monday will present a system of three emergency stages against the coronavirus
Gradually they will be depending on the strength of community distribution at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," said Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch in the Czech Republic.
It will be called traffic lights, the individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that the inclusion of individual regions will still be discussed with epidemiologists.
He admitted that at present only the Moravian-Silesian region would have an orange color and Prague would be approaching him.
The map will also include individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to solve this at the level of regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
Vodn<0xC3><0xAD>k and Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka
When the waterman Jonas and the miller’s daughter Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka stare at each other, it is not easy at all.
Jonah's father, the sloppy waterman Hastrbuch, prevents him from falling in love, and Caroline has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not human.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially the Caroline, from that waterman villain.
How about he intrigues and lies?
Especially if she can make Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka reject Jonah and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the Night Teapot, spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other raccoons.
The enraged villagers will set up a hunt for the waterman, and an irreconcilable vodnik curse will fall on Jonah's head.
And now, Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ek's soul, Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and rescue him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of <0xC4><0x8C>T and in the exteriors of the Brzin pond, in Obd<0xC4><0x9B>nice in the Sedl<0xC4><0x8D>ansk<0xC3><0xA1> region and in the beautiful environment of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

Customers of the Mostek Autodrom can use the new e-shop on its website.
It will also purchase coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously only possible personally with a worker of the autodrome in the starting tower.
“We have started to improve the e-shop to make it user-friendly, while at the same time expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, on this occasion, we have prepared for our customers a bonus in the form of a discount of CZK 1,000 for all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found on the website www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, Commercial and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.

The majority of cases are mild, with only three percent of those infected having to go to hospital.
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or a summer dose of sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious departments of hospitals are semi-empty, although the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalized people," Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch confirms.
It is worth recalling that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out collections, the republic was closed, and the Czechs used disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died every day.
Today, the daily increase in the number of infected people is higher, but every day a maximum of two people die from COVID-19.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infections per capita, and Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by a hygienist in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradecko.
The disease was confirmed by tests with one of the nurses.
"We are chasing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Sch<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B>l, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the house so far have symptoms of the disease.
Area testing will begin with hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a mask on at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of the coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of a prachatic company.
Overall, 131 people were infected on Saturday – half the number on Friday – but less tested on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished the fairy tale, Anderson was swept away
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh showed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious company in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian dartsman.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-pound leg and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" was hard to get to the doubles.
The way in which "Dreammaker" had it in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that the scattered Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian mastered great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, but in an unfavorable condition, he "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, there was a lot of frustration in Anderson.
He was throwing darts, and his opponent was acting completely sovereign after his triumph.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three match darts and honored his name - he wrote his big dream.
The winning of the trophy, named after Phil Taylor, is all the more valuable to the Belgian dartsman as he is his first major win.
The last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, charged with burning the cathedral, the man confessed
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original stained glass windows from the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Investigators investigated the arson suspects because the fire was advancing through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, police did not find any signs of anyone entering the cathedral by force.
The defendant is a volunteer at a local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecuting him.
Now, prosecutors have reported that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday, we will present a "lighthouse" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to serve the role of a pandemic plan, due to the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"The degrees will be according to the power of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in each region varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be imposed on each stage, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Minister of the Interior Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Party TV show, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented on this by saying that there is nothing fundamentally wrong to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
In view of the growing number of infections in the Czech Republic since Saturday, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government’s approach, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures would apply and when they would be announced, was criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, compensate for the confusion," Senator Marek Hil<0xC5><0xA1>er said in his Questions.
Measures can already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday there is an obligation to wear masks even in non-residential medical facilities, for example, in pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in the Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> and <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> regions.
In the Highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in internal public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutn<0xC3><0xA1> Hora region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and, accordingly, regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, authorities have not required a negative coronavirus test from Czech citizens since June 15 or imposed quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
Currently, all EU Member States are in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues.
Playing at one-third capacity, she should have finished at noon
Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty near Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Lhota in the Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko region continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates were about three hundred, in the morning there were 900, police spokeswoman Lucie Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems were actually silent.
"Some have already left, and others are about to leave.
The music production continues in part.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and dismantling of music systems," Novakov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
“Police continue to closely monitor outgoing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of police officers are overseeing the action, foreign police, transport and police officers are on the spot, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During today, police inspected 470 people moving at the scene and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novakov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police also dealt with 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants of the technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
This was stated by the Minister of the Interior Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on the Prima Party television program.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, and neither did the hygienic station or the Ministry of Health request it.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that the technoparty has expanded to the surrounding land, the owners of which did not agree with the use for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damages.
Supporters of techna on the meadow at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
Police initially guarded the meadow in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>imi in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko, where the technoparty took place last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s Lhota, where the technicians eventually actually went.
According to Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, no one came to Bla<0xC5><0xBE>imi.
Snake bite: Girl ends up in hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in the railways.
The snake bit a girl in the foot there, the year 2010, who was brought by her parents to the rescue service base there," Maria Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, a regional spokeswoman for the medical rescue service, told Dn<0xC3><0xAD>k that the child was taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The snake is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chance that the snake will bite you is not very high, in ordinary contact it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud squeak.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you step on it by mistake.
However, her bite is not a tragedy, her poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can occur only if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk of danger is mainly in children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea after a bite, weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers may experience anaphylactic shock," Miriam Gredov<0xC3><0xA1> from Klatovy Hospital told Dn<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The man threatened to throw the baby out the window.
After the policeman poured wine and threw dishes
After 11 p.m., an emergency unit broke into the apartment and detained the men.
The infants were immediately taken care of by health workers, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovsk<0xC3><0xA1> said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
One day he even climbed onto the window sill, where he was clapping.
Police are still investigating the man.
He does not want to publish any more information yet.
Stosurov<0xC3><0xA1> will give preference to her daughter over tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not enter the coronavirus-affected season this year.
Sixty-six-year-old champion of the US Open 2011, who became a mother in June, but still does not want to finish her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
“I’ll stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones our Evie will experience in the next six months, and just enjoy it,” she said in a statement.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on 3 August with an anthurium tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie Reveals Meat, Fish and Eggs of Unknown Origin
"One of the vehicles entering the complex transported 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of at the disposal plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the live fish stand, it was then found that the seller had no evidence of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for the long term.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal grocery store in the country, with almost half a ton of unlabeled food without proof of origin.
For most, it was not possible to determine the date of consumption, some of the products had a past shelf life and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky ahead of ceasefire in Donbas, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to begin from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin, criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The cease-fire is set to begin after midnight on Monday night, be "full and general" and pave the way for other provisions of the peace accords to be met.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and jeopardizes the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament last week decided that the upcoming elections to local councils would not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the separatist-occupied Ukrainian border with Russia after giving the regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
The Zelensky office said the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and on the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing some units from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea, and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but in occasional shootings and artillery attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed more than 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet taken place.
Unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, the seven-batch was dominated by Novotn<0xC3><0xA1>
The defender of the last two titles, Dole<0xC5><0xBE>al, did not score a four-hundred at the end of Saturday's program, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> did not jump the foundation in the bar on Sunday.
For a long time, the ten-man team was ruled by the Latvian national team Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but after the disc he resigned.
Rykl has so far won two bronze medals from the Czech Republic, this time he was the only ten-man to cross the 7,000 mark.
Vilém Str<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urb<0xC3><0xA1>nek won other medals for him.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> S<0xC3><0xBD>kora after the competition.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start because the results would have looked very different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a persona 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the stick, and I was most disappointed about the disk, there I was below average," he admitted on the union's Facebook.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> won the first day of the seven-fight with a more than 100-point lead, even though she was plagued by an injured ankle on a rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not cross 40 meters with a spear and did not advance to the final eight hundred.
Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> scored 5878 points and won by 241 points before Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wish it was around 630.
Yesterday my calf began to pull, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular because of its significantly lower price compared to gasoline or diesel, given a significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and diesel, it has its own environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market the previous year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
“In these days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our gas stations in combination with the classic fossil LPG,” said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Karl<0xC3><0xAD>k from Primagas.
However, LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which a number of motorists are now refueling into their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the production method," says Ivan Indr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is quite good, for example, compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
By contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by natural gas separation.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" (in English "from source to tank").
Some of the largest producers of bio LPG currently include the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is exploring the possibility of production in its refinery in Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov.
According to the Association’s estimates, there are about 170,000 LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered cars were converted last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch revised the number of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers of those infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number fell from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479, which is 1775 fewer cases.
There are currently 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the surge in the number of cures is the revision of data, which recently hygienists have not been able to update," said Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 COVID-19 cases had unfortunately died.
Mobile constituencies or correspondence choices.
Politician and sociologist looking for options for the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in order for people in quarantine to vote in October's regional and Senate elections, the law needs to be amended.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He said this on Sunday at the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the current legal rules.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to health conditions cannot vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM program that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of YES or CSSD (because, according to the experience from abroad, this would rather be recorded by other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overrated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that now it is necessary to come up with ad hoc mechanisms (choices) that could be implemented as early as this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
As another, he sees the already mentioned electoral units or the possibility of representative voting within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Bucharest: Protesters threw pig ears at government building
Protesters against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another of a series of protests against the "mafia style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA news agency said.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, had a weaker participation than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
By 8:00 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed for traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government building played a theatrical scene in which they symbolically imprisoned both Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the main demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadzhigenov, said on public radio that a "peak escalation" in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades across the country" was going to take place on Wednesday.
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borissov and his government, as well as for early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borissov has previously said he will not resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to implement Bulgaria with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, though the concession did not reassure the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov’s government suspended a vote of confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants games without spectators
Football coach Bologna Sini<0xC5><0xA1>a Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we are doing here is not football.
I'm fed up with no spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
It's terrible to play like this and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovic said before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus pause, Serie A matches follow in a quick succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
Under such conditions, you don’t even know how the teams are doing.
Let's get this season over with.
These measures had to be taken in order to win the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back,” said the coach, who also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D>, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench for the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the league break and everything else, our team has managed to move up the level.
We want to continue to grow and to do this we need the players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises have been reported fires and explosions.
Some Iranian officials said the fire, which broke out this month in an underground nuclear plant in Natanz, may have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic faces "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to be repulsed.
In recent months, he said, there have been several widespread cyberattacks that have been blamed on "certain governments and groups," according to the analysis.
However, he did not provide any further details on the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
He also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state agency IRNA this month discussed how Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could have been behind recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militias Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of rockets at bases in Iraq, where the Americans are active.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA Extends Production Shutdown to May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended the shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are scheduled to restart on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
The attack will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said a spokesman for the car manufacturer Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavirus affects key markets such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Cologne) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA does not sign on life in the city.
"From the beginning, it was clear that the city was empty.
But the streets are gradually filling up, especially now, since Monday, when it got a lot looser.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
He said there were no complications with foreign workers staying in the shelters.
"In those two months, we had to solve almost no problem," Kaspar said.
For example, the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav-based <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants operate at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
In the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and employers in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to the family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson had been battling insidious cancer, and when it seemed she had defeated the cancer, the disease came back.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in bed in a hospice, where she still had time to take her life’s love.
Unfortunately, the disease succumbed.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her friend Ricky Moore, with whom she has lived for more than 16 years, have traveled around the world in competitions.
The 39-year-old was a healthy athlete who was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhaustive treatment, radiation therapy, in the hopes of recovering.
After months of treatment, Gemma did seem to have won the battle with cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British daily Daily Mirror, underwent a 10-hour spine surgery and then began drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her that she had only a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde finally decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma one last time on their two-month anniversary to a restaurant.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post on her social media account appeared that Gema had written for her family.
“If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too much fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side all along, and given me a tremendous amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media.
“I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all of my followers on the social network,” she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the passerby will receive a pocket work by mostly beginning Czech artists.
Images and other creations are created directly for artmates, so they know in advance that they must fit into a size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist in the package and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Widzov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer may be surprised what kind of work of art he gets.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra <0xC5><0xA0>toplov<0xC3><0xA1> or miniviews by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The Punx 23 artist, in cooperation with Dora Dutkova, prepared a pixel associated with a walk through Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrov<0xC3><0xA1> and Juliana Chomov<0xC3><0xA1> sell the pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the trident and a fortune-telling card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book The Spiritist.
Wages in the healthcare sector will increase by a maximum of 5% next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic, according to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch
Wages in the health sector could rise by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for YES) said in Questions by V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Moravec on Czech Television.
The union’s demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aids.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (wages) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March it intervened in the selection of insurance premiums for the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread.
Insurance revenues fell at the time.
"A 15 percent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS) is likely to reach CZK 88,312 this year, nurses CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
Data from the <0xC3><0x9A>ZIS also shows that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125, according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow pay tables, and the contractual salaries in hospitals in cities, counties or private ones.
Therefore, they also require that the salary tables be uniform for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber Roman <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, trade unions should see how it is currently.
The House recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit this year to a record CZK 500 billion, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the rewards of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers, according to <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, does not agree with a flat salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical institutions themselves, and the money in addition should go to them through a payment order.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective medical aids in its possession.
Waiting for the completion of the tendering process.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
The shattering smart quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We are ready, they say.
“The smart quarantine is working, there is something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss it with the military tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not run the whole thing again," the prime minister said on his Facebook page on Sunday.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygienic stations, which must gradually move to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian region, where some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic are.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK news agency that he had no information on Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a ninety-member central management team established under the military as an advisory body to the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The tremor project was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Sunday.
He also said that the army could take him back.
The shortcomings in the project were previously acknowledged by Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Dzurilla, the government’s IT and digitalization commissioner, who is in charge of the project.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
For twenty years it has been created independently and non-systemically, now we are trying to unite it in a few months.
It can't be jetted.
The people on the march, the poor on the hygiene on the march adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes,” he said.
Mayor of Ostrava Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "go crazy in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is an effort to "not get lost in politics," he told Respect.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the presidency of the ANO movement, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava, led by him, won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
“I thought I could hold out for one term and with my business experience, I could turn everything around and get back on its feet,” he said.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for a second term.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don’t want to fool around in politics,” added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a heavy introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about Macur's possible end in the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example, for his alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, YES supported in the election of Zeman’s opponent Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Draho<0xC5><0xA1>.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
“As long as I feel like I can make a difference in the movement, that it’s not a futile fight, and that no one cares about it, I have no immediate motive to stop,” he said.
Macura, 65, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was, among other things, the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He has also served on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transportation services
At the end of July, Uber will return to Brno, which offers transportation services.
This is a consequence of the change in the law, said Petr Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l (ODS), the Brno councillor for transport, in a press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as marking as a taxi or taximeter.
However, with the amendment of the law, the conditions for operating both conventional and alternative taxis have changed since July.
In recent weeks, Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l has held several talks with Uber representatives.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits,” Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l said.
Uber has worked in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it for not marking vehicles as taxis or missing taximeters.
The court issued an interim measure banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but last year, Mayor Markéta Va<0xC5><0x88>kov<0xC3><0xA1> (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber was allowed to drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return as a result of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too lush celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of the apartment on Saturday evening in Brno and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a pedestrian who immediately called the police.
On arrival at the address in the western part of the city, the guard noticed an open window, under which the chair still lay, and next to it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The movement that was carried out from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers walked down the hall to the apartment and asked three young men between the ages of twenty-six and ninety-nine for explanations,” said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the officers.
The request for the appeal of Rafaj will discuss Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with the CSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss with the coalition social democrats the request for the dismissal of the head of the antitrust office (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS) Petr Rafaj.
The non-profit organizations called for the dismissal of Rafaj at the meeting of the anti-corruption council of the government and also the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region.
The Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second term expires in the middle of next year, under the law, he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is the responsibility of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Rafaj’s recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would familiarize himself with the materials and that the government parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he had not yet negotiated with the president, and that he would not have a meeting with him in the near future.
According to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktualno.cz wrote last week that the police are interested in Rafaj’s meetings with the captain Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the project of a controversial new Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital for eight billion, which <0xC4><0x8C>unek is firmly promoting.
The bun admitted the meeting, according to him, they jointly dealt with his "senate activities".
Raphael says the same thing.
The administration of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region called on the government to appeal Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for the reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS on public procurement according to Jaroslav Kom<0xC3><0xAD>nek, Deputy Chief of Transport, is not transparent and has signs of willfulness.
Last March, police intervened with the antitrust authority over a toll-collection tender.
This year, in June, the server Aktualno.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written for the company of influential behind-the-scenes player <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Alexander Chuba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj’s account.
Rafaj has been the President of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and the President appointed a former Member of Social Democracy for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafayev's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not held office for more than six months or if it seriously undermines the dignity of its office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blansko library, the workers were collapsing in the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new equipment will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blansko on a regular basis.
In the warmer months, however, it was practically impossible to stand there.
There was a terrible heat and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That’s why I love the air conditioning,” said one of the Blanen readers Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the library Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Dlapa, the temperatures in the building have often risen to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and works like a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, thanks to the curvature of the building, the sun rests on it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to air individual departments, because during the night, for safety reasons, the windows must be closed.
We often have this from the morning in the library to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
Worst of all was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And a floor above then the exhibition room and the director's office.
An unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It has happened several times that librarians collapsed at work and ended in incapacity for work.
The problem also regularly occurred in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes there was no breathing, "said Dlapa.
Initially, the representatives of the city wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three out of five circuits.
Due to limited funding, only the most troubled areas will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are one floor higher," informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Svoboda from the Blanen investment department.
He added that in the first phase, last autumn, the workers installed air conditioning in the above-mentioned premises and adjusted the electrical installation.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The City Library of Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of that, about nine hundred to fifteen years.
Chicago's resistance has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are silent about the health of the players and do not publish anything.
He was one of the few to emerge from the Crawford line.
The 35-year-old Montréal native was present only in the first training session, since then he has been absent from the squad.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last 14 days locked up in my house," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about their health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into the full load again.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goalkeeper won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goal is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will play a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the lead.
Thousands protest in Israel against Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place outside Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Participants are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is dealing with another wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's familiar nickname.
"Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his clothes," another said.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel’s first prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and misuse of trust.
He denies all the charges and calls them witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which has a population of about nine million, has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel.
Of the 455 people killed in the outbreak.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce daily increases in infected people.
After the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, however, especially at the end of June, the number of infected again began to increase significantly.
Netanyahu’s critics say the government has not been able to provide sufficient assistance to tradesmen affected by quarantine measures, for example.
Protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
Firefighters had to cut the body out of the wreckage.
The tragic accident occurred around 11 p.m. near Neveklov in a narrow district leading from the Slap Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at a slow speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued from the wreckage by firefighters, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
An end to wasting and throwing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and embarks on a fundamental change of strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to spit one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the largest polluters of the environment is not a novelty.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
The view of slow fashion, often a disdained approach to clothing, has changed quite rapidly in recent years.
About half of the goods Pietro Filipi sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to throw one collection after the other and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the times of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
“Most discount traders already count when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a scam," says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
“Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and over-seasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is absent from any discounts typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," adds Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Giant graffiti presents RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was liked by the city leadership," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
It consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-<0xC5><0xA0>anov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, he was dragged by the Nazis to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig entered the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently completed pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He took part in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, 46, who is known as Camo in the street art industry, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
Graffiti began on the surfaces allocated for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hanna storm arrives off the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwestern coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CET tonight).
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened in a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and heavy rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damages, including damaged ships, have been reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and recommended people to evacuate voluntarily.
The strongest warning came from people in the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total it has the element to hit an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous surf and rare tornadoes can pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a statement.
This morning local time (afternoon CEL<0xC4><0x8C>) the storm was moving in the area of the U.S.-Mexico border and was accompanied by a wind at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, which gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it advanced to the mainland, which again knocked Hanna out of the hurricane category.
Authorities have urged local residents to wait at home for the storms, while not forgetting the hygiene measures associated with preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to observe distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who had tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take their masks and disinfectant gels with them, if possible.
"We're not far behind yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding,” said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places up to 300 millimeters of rain could fall in a matter of hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimeters, which together with rising sea levels could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman gives the rank of general to Colonel Lipko
On Wednesday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will grant the rank of general to Colonel Pavel Lipko.
This is according to the Ministry of Defense’s expected events.
The reason for the award of the rank of brigadier general is the August entry of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the alliance multinational division of the Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel <0xC5><0x98>ehka as deputy commander of the multinational division of the Northeast in the Polish Elblag, which commands the Allied forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, he became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Office (N<0xC3><0x9A>KIB).
The government proposed to the president to grant Lipko the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Professional Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be conferred on a soldier for the duration of an elected office or for the duration of a service assignment requiring the conferral of a higher rank.
The rank of deputy commander of the allied division corresponds to the rank of general.
A soldier to whom the rank has been conferred shall have the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to the rank.
Lease of the rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted is omitted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
He is significantly involved in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at the Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with distance or wearing masks in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the agreement had been signed by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be sufficient fresh air in the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed upon by the officials shall meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
In the Arctic Svalbard fell the temperature record, there measured almost 22 degrees
“A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen,” the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, surpassing the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbards are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers posed by warming in other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report from the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as ten degrees if greenhouse gases are not released into the atmosphere.
The increase in temperature in Svalbard can result in the melting of permafrost soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can also cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
British returnees from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential trips to mainland Spain because of the risk of the spread of COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must remain in isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the statement said.
“We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries,” she said.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
The British government is concerned that they will be paid sick pay if they have to spend 14 days in isolation after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-day vacation to Lanzarote, scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
“We were supposed to go with my whole family, my wife Amanda and my daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don’t know what’s going to happen.
“I work as a train driver and I don’t think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after I return from vacation,” he said.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been more than 900 new cases in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Electricity purchase model from Dukovan will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of electricity purchase from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity in the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek (for ANO) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ have already said that the more likely option is that people will save thanks to the construction for electricity.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
Environmental organizations have previously criticized the plan.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people on the Dukovan construction site will make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact will be in tens of crowns per year for the family, which is much less than people pay annually in electricity invoices to support the so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the buyout price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any draft amount, it should be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, on which traders now supply the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity in the amount of ten euros, the surcharge of an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could be equal to a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances including an electric hob and an oven, but not using electricity for heating and non-heating.
“We are living in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be an extremely speculative matter," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, CEO of the Energy Financial Group, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The proposed law envisages that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO, or by a legal entity authorised by it, owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The agreement between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but not longer than until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon production design as a nuclear-powered power plant connected to an electricity system with installed capacity with a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek previously said that the new Dukovansk<0xC3><0xBD> block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the equipment during construction without interest, while the operation is expected to be at 2% interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should contribute 70 percent to the construction.
The remainder should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> said in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and CEZ for the construction of a new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn the material about the support of tourism in the media for two billion
The Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) plans to spend CZK 2 billion in media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic.
Minister Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> (for YES) said that the material is still being worked on.
A document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by Zdopravy.cz.
The ministry justified the plan with the collapse of tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media and revenues declined.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website glidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism for advertising in televisions, radio, the press, the Internet, billboards or squares at railway stations.
The largest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
The majority would be acquired by private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weekly newspapers would receive $400 million and the same share would be given to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for a media campaign, most of it privately owned.
The remaining $150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at train stations or in the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> said without further details on the server SeznamNavl<0xC3><0xA1>dy.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarova Adamova, the advertising would benefit from the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babis (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn of the election," she wrote on Twitter.
Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> denies that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she said on Friday.
According to him, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting, it could be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
Let's Save Tourism initiative does not make sense media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, chairman of the initiative.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
A broth of life, a rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album titled A Death is the stem of the grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s discography he is the fifth item and, like in previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s poetry, which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, the year 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passed through his own, personally presented experiences as well as very intrinsic expressions of faith.
But he was far from agitation, whether he spoke or wrote of faith, of God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, utterly tolerant.
I think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek), the masters will forgive me.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s album offers recordings of author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Kl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, or Honza Barto<0xC5><0x88> and V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I will help - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s long poems.
"She radiated with pride and unending bitterness," writes Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka, "over the state of our world at risk of extinction.
The world, which is becoming increasingly dulled by consumerism and greed, is increasingly drifting away from what its soul was created from—from the secrets of faith, humility, and human closeness.
In them was expressed the longing of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest to a few, but who also knows that it is only because of general disinterest that they cannot be renounced.
Those poems reminded us that one might have to lose everything dear, but it is not insignificant how one loses it.
If he sells himself to general bankruptcy, he sceptically resigns, is frightened to remain silent, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves.
“Paroubek is not my advisor,” said Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
The former prime minister and chairman of the CSSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The party president and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said this today on the Prima Party television program.
On Friday, SeznamZav<0xC4><0x9B>dy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s advisor.
"Sometimes we will write an email, he will send me some material and I will read it," Hamacek said.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"That I read his opinion from time to time, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana <0xC4><0x8C>ernochova, the minister said that many ODS members still "listen to the views of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus unobtrusively".
It is okay, he said, because he is an experienced politician and former party president, which is the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media are making an affair out of it, he called a sign of this year's cucumber season.
On Friday, SeznamZawedzy.cz reported that Paroubek was acting as Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the candidate of the party in the Ust'ek region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as the vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamacek said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, lamenting the Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American stickman who has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat two years younger Duplantis, last year he defeated him at the meeting of the NCAA University Association.
"We had a battle a year before, he and I were second, then we changed it.
In both cases, it was a very good duel," Nilsen, who secured the victory with a 5.95-meter run, said.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply upwards and is now alone in the highest barber spheres.
At just 20 years old, he became a world record holder, this year on 8 February in Torun he surpassed the bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
“He jumped six meters when he was 18 when he finished high school,” Nilsen told the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew from a boy to a man, he would multiply his potential and talent.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he said.
Although Nilsen’s list of accomplishments is thinner than Duplantis’s, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February he improved his internal personal record at one of them to 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought for the American expedition to the World Cup, where he finished 13.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“Definitely my priority is to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that’s where you can make a name for yourself,” he said.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead at events like the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Pan-American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and other bartenders time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere duel for silver?
"Everyone's trying to reach him, but I don't think that's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen thinks.
"He's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he will want to increase it even more.
A woman has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her disabled son’s pension.
A trial awaits her
The money that the 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to ill health, the court deprived the sick man of his right and appointed his mother a guardian, who was supposed to manage, among other things, his son’s money.
“From mid-November 2013 to January this year, a woman used part of her son’s disability pension for her own use and deprived him of 440 thousand crowns,” police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that as a guardian she had a special duty to defend the interests of the victim.
The woman, according to the court order, had set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
“After paying for the expenses associated with the son’s stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of a vehicle, electrical appliances and for the running of the household,” the indictment said.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own needs.
But she defended herself by helping them pay their family expenses.
“We had problems with our income to tighten the running of the house.
We've never bought anything above standard.
It was always about things your son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime,” she told police.
He promised to return the money to his son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say
Finds from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spearheads.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments date back to 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here,” said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people of the cave Chiquihuite, located at a high altitude, lived for a long 20,000 years.
So far, the widely accepted theory has been that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Clovisian culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
But this model has cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reported 42 different locations across North America, proving human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them could have come to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada.
Interest in tickets so far fulfills an optimistic scenario, according to sellers.
Prices are gradually falling too.
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half that, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis fulfills the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
The most popular destinations are, according to sellers, mainly the southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, the most sold flights are to Croatia's Split.
Of the other countries, the UK is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of flights is also decreasing.
At the Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz portal, it was around 6250 crowns in the middle of the month, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85% of sales.
However, prices are also falling in some European cities, such as Spain or Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, as they fear further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of a pre-departure ticket has decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
“This confirms the future trend of people ordering tickets much less in advance, requiring more flexibility, less risk,” said Michal <0xC5><0xA0>indel<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
There are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
Compared to last year’s summer season, it is about half of the destinations.
The big finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand finale.
It will feature the experienced 49-year-old Scottish dart player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then bumped into his neighbor in the charts.
However, he also dealt with James Wade, and in the quarter-finals he fought vigorously with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"The Flying Scotsman" was almost in the semifinals, when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped from the shovel, dominated in the extension and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovi<0xC4><0x8D> 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament, and perhaps just knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old dartsman first surprisingly knocked out the world six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle overthrew also Joe Cullen, and in the quarterfinals, after a sharp start, overcame also Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-finals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but in the calm playing Belgian then excellent series got a lead, which then more or less without problems to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he exposed to occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the discovery of the novel coronavirus in the Czech Republic in early March, it has infected 15,212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are sick.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times in a row two hundred.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, 235 tests were positive, 246 the day before, and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first day of the week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have already been cured of COVID-19, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with the coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infections in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants, almost 59.
The following are the districts of Jihlava with 56 and Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>secko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increase in the number of infections, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events for more than 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced by half from the current thousand people.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by the Johns Hopkins University of America, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The balance of victims who died from COVID-19 is close to 645,000, according to the source.
The latest one million infections were added to the statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on July 22.
The United States, which has registered more than 4.1 million cases in recent days, Brazil with 2.4 million, and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, according to authorities, had the largest share of the rapid increase in cases.
Infected people are now growing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases were added worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil and India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially reported today by the DPRK.
Household air is five times worse than outdoor air.
Health Harms Air Fresheners and Deodorants
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by the Israeli expert on human health Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was credited with creating Israel’s Ministry of the Environment, the focus should be on household pollutants right now, with many people spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned a study by the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA) that found that indoor air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
“Due to the coronavirus epidemic that has forced many people to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it’s time to focus on air quality in their homes,” she said.
In Israel, almost no one is concerned with the quality of "home air".
Dangerous things can be things with which a person usually comes into contact - coatings, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas is also released by clothes that we regularly carry to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
Children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
With long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
However, not all pollutants come from household items, and the material from which the houses are built can also be a source.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel quiz: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada has lost a chance to advance to Spain's highest football league due to a coronavirus outbreak.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed second-league final duel, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
On Saturday, Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people, bringing the total number of positive COVID-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to illness in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had a point to get into the playoffs.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruni definitively canceled due to higher power due to the fact that there was no time to play it.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, on the other hand, is rioting against the match.
In the end, due to the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to the customs complete in a single term.
The leadership of the former elite Spanish club threatens to fall to the third league court.
The first two teams of the Huesca and C<0xC3><0xA1>diz table have the security of progress between the elite.
Zaragoza, Almer<0xC3><0xAD>a, Girona and Elche will face off in the playoffs.
Karel Gott didn't like V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel?!
Dominique's daughter discovered it.
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," Gotta Dominika, the eldest daughter, told Aha!, saying that the Master couldn't come up with a name for Havel, and whenever he was spoken to, Karl was always angry.
It’s hard to say what they did, but according to Dominika, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"My father, in an article after the revolution, said that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark, but if he rebelled in any way, his career would be over,” Gott said.
But then he adds that eventually the Czech greats found their way to each other.
"I know the word 'Havel' couldn't have been heard until he was sixty.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday, and suddenly my father’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the then-former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
“And that’s where a new era of their relationship began, because Mr. Havel’s father regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home in Bertramka,” added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k was also saddened that he had never received a state award from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
After all, he met him in 2009, although it was already at the hands of his successor in the role of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus (79).
Another honor will be received in memoriam, because the current President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
On Tuesday, the Czech Republic is in danger of heat, meteorologists warn of fires
The warning of meteorologists from high temperatures applies for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Extraordinarily, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in Central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to observe a drinking regime in the heat and to reduce body weight in the afternoon and afternoon.
Due to the warm weather with a minimum of precipitation, there will be a risk of fires starting on Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires concerns Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD>, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen region.
The fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect significant collisions that would mitigate the dangers in the northwest and west of the Czech Republic until at least the end of the week," the statement said.
The Prague City Hall has responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning fires at risky locations, which is due to take effect from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires, for example, in parks, gardens or forests, up to a distance of 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these areas.
The measure will remain in force until appeal, said a spokesman for the Prague City Hall, V<0xC3><0xAD>t Hofman.
