The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29%
A marked weakening of both sides of the current grand coalition and a marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian captain Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8% of the vote, but against the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5% of the vote.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost by 25.6 per cent almost 9 per cent of the vote.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially of the People’s Party, which triggered the early elections, a literally catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the MPs had a significant lead over the SPÖ in their preferences.
The voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the chairman of the party and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's presidency.
Such a development would likely facilitate the path to an increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. the resumption of a large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPÖ) won a preliminary 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - at the same time the Social Democrats voiced concern about the 1999 repeat of the year when the People's Party negotiated with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 the FPÖ even split from the BZÖ party) to a joint government.
This development is clearly based on Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and envisages a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but it lost slightly and fell among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% threshold and did not get into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India could cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
After the meeting, Mukherjee said that the executive might be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, which has jurisdiction over the matter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, according to Mukherjee, it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then ask for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same opinion during the negotiations.
"He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get involved in the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing them with such assistance.
“We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side to deal with things, the minister avoided.
"I've received quite a few promises," he said.
Czech judge the fight for the seabed
It will proceed to a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-strong UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea team.
His boss, the division’s director, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, observes and occasionally adds to the interpretation.
There's a working spirit and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Here you can find oil, ores and other minerals, but also hitherto unknown living organisms, which carry the key to the development of a cure for cancer.
The bottom is bigger than the mainland
Today, coastal states have begun to apply for new underwater territories vehemently.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCLOS) established in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
According to the Convention, it has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf has that part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only three of the last mentioned countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The worldwide resonance recently saw the success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater states.
But he also acquired New Zealand - the area of the seabed, which the commission granted him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The future profits from the use of the seabed will be invaluable, as they promise.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do so up to ten years after they ratified the “Montego Bay Convention”.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, declared by convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka in an exaggeration, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It was granted the status of a "pioneering investor" in 1991 under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is fragmented, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be mined on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian employee of the division Robert Sandev brings to the demonstration one such concretion.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a fairy-tale scheme that, according to legend, revived the Golem.
German Special Operations Forces were in the process of releasing the hostages.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were ready, but no deployment took place.
Further details of the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 abducted European tourists in Egypt are gradually coming to the public.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the defence and interior ministries.
According to the ministries, both experts from the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, the air force of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as experts in logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene of the liberation.
However, according to a further statement from the two ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the captors had let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany as a supportive force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," one of the interior ministry's spokesmen said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages were moved to border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of the release or the possible payment of the ransom.
They are now safely rescued in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is under the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There is no information yet on when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" all five tourists should fly with special forces one of the Airbus of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress, by a narrow majority, let a $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets fall.
The Dow Jones index fell sharply.
In a 206-227 vote, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, the majority did not find a program that should ease the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, urged MPs to give their consent before the vote, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
The Dow Jones index fell by more than 6%, or 600 points.
Investors are concerned that the state rescue package could collapse.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose, then fell sharply after the announcement of the collapse of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, both the House of Representatives and the Senate have to agree.
Travel agents are recording a growing number of bookings
It seems that winter will be good for German businessmen in tourism:
According to one study, travel bookings for the following months increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel remains undiminished.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as announced by the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already increased bookings available for the autumn months.
According to the DRV, the turnover for October was about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
These results are based on GfK numbers, which evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included travel bookings that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States is in demand, the DRV said.
For these routes, the increase in bookings accounts for about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable for Germans.
Above all, organized tours are on course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "more easily calculated for the client than for an individually organized vacation".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by taking advantage of early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so there will again be a higher turnover compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Infinitely repetitive navel, beer from tuples and prominents in cuts from well-known designers.
First time on a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV presenter and wears a custom-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we are not even three minutes on the beer meadow, and already photographers are throwing at us and quickly filling up memory cards - it flatters me, because I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems that my cheap costume has accomplished its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears women's clothing or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The special views at the stand with bananas in chocolate only reap my apron.
One monk reminds me that I had wrongly tied her up: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, on the back you are widowed."
I'll shift my bows from the back to the left.
"Okay," he says, laughing.
Others are not so much interested in subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "To drink to get dressed!" and push on passers-by's naked asses.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks "gorgeous", with an extended "ooh".
That's what he's telling me after he's relieved himself of his just-drunken mule.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as the public in Bavaria calls it.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, they run around the area where the Oktoberfest takes place, a bunch of paramedics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Doctors always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most beer meadow visitors: empty there, full back.
Who lies under the tarpaulin of this coffin of promille is not seen.
"It's the one that can't go on," one of the paramedics will call in response to my question and disappear into the crowd.
Police Release Name of Victim of Accident
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He had already been released on police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are widening
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern shore of the Bosporus, perhaps just twenty paces in Asia, stands one of the best monuments to this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpa<0xC5><0x9F>a railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
That’s what a tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits round at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the facade, looking indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gateway to the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which became involved late in the game by the empires, intended to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by using this railway, which was supposed to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops marched out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there's bad news for Hydarpasha Station, too.
In 1917, an explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually crumbling and history has been bypassing it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves, at least symbolically, to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development party - the AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a curvy ride on the tracks that reminded me of the old-world rhythms of the famous Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
In the West, she aroused suspicions, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP main tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, purposely built in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and powerhouses, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to make early morning shopping.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy objective is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey was cut off from its homeland.
Today we have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But I'm sure there will come a time," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want that kind of decision to happen."
Then he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are as good for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, take these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpa<0xC5><0x9F>a Station, after another mostly waking night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had watched the construction of this building a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East may now be, in large part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting in the harbour for the ferry back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt about which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologue, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district musical plan, he founded the excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus sang the last time in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 — we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to engage in any music that was presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged all the time.
How often only Todd told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it! "
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor florid.
Wherever the standard of music was, it always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in his two decades of conducting the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I’ve reviewed over 100 of his concerts over the past 40 years and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by any of them – and I’ve been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "dragged one or two soaked pecs around the world".
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's remark by the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication The British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
“I recommend José Vicente Resina’s exhibition ‘Flamenco and Life’ because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They implicated me with the simplicity and the strong charge with which they affect the viewers, and with the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
“Resino can capture magical moments.”
Honda strikes for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-room vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
To this end, improved engines are added, which increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have been made to this one-room car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the introduction of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year's 2008.
Almost a million units have been sold in Japan since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market was the old continent with about half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, is aiming for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
While in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of Honda Jazz, in 2009 it estimated 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
In terms of the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz model since 2002, which is 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a 16% decrease.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
This is the Honda Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises to sell about 200,000 units worldwide per year.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year, when it will be presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in size.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also resulted in an increase in the internal space.
This advantage was achieved, on the one hand, by the use of a new platform, on the other, by the storage of a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - also increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the 1.4 engine, as the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 degrees for the first Jazz model.
With the second generation of Honda Jazz, the engines are also new.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the drive system, while high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2-liter engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 hp - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with a power of 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan was inspired by nature, specifically bees, to make progress in the development of accident-protective technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the role of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Center for Technological Advancement have developed a robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Advancement at the prestigious Tokyo University.
According to Kazuhir Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Development of the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of Nissan’s safety shield.
The robot is tasked to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
Most important, however, are the folded bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles up to a distance of two meters within a 180-degree radius of the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot will mimic the bee movements and immediately change direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, a robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction by which it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and according to these data, it should behave.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we’re not talking about giga or mega in memory.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for instant precipitation prevention, a technology for which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would guide the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy Fear Before You Take a Mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, does not lack ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages with banks with dubious solvency, she created a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
It's not like a bad credit hotel... or a messed up hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionist, look bleak to think once, twice, and three times whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a place for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel there is a dream room.
At least something, because it's better not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
Bank Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, will spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant decline in its exchange rate.
A week after revealing their preliminary deal, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a single price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the carrying amount of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion to acquire convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and an exchange rate of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock, however, lost 6.79 percent and reached $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a banking holding company status,” said John Mack, CEO of the group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week to allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time it places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest ace to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The terms of the deal show that the deal has changed over the past few days: Morgan just announced last Monday that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought," Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to reduce risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for Morgan Stanley securities than their book value.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in earnings from the stock.
The agreement stipulates that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price 50% above the exchange price, i.e. approximately $ 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash flow.
However, the group’s spokesman declined to provide further details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had “sensibly” reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs picked up the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buyout, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
To re-establish a republic around 21st-century socialism.
This is a joint project by Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez of Venezuela, Eva Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Last Sunday, the third candidate, following the example of his counterparts and friends, tabled a proposal for a new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order to pass the bill, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted near the east of the polling stations and a calculation by NGOs on Sunday predicted a clear "yes" victory, ranging from 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft constitution.
"The Constitution has won the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Organization of American States (OEA) observation mission, took place calmly, concerned the text of 444 points building up the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution consecrates the state's power over the economy by reserving to it "development planning" of a country living primarily on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and on the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The Correa-backed proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will exercise this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution, among other things, reinforces the principle of free health and education, which the president began to introduce in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, he also expects to ban the presence of foreign troops, thereby ending the agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorean base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
In Chad, 19 hostages were freed.
An Egyptian commando took 11 tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago, by the hijacker.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
The hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without the opportunity to express themselves in the press, aboard a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a suburban residential area of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the hijackers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garrana said at the airport's runway.
Since its capture on September 19, during a four-wheeled safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard, Aegyptus Agency director, a safari organizer.
A senior Egyptian security official suggested that 30 members of the special forces who approached the site aboard two helicopters had set off on a steak during the night just before dawn.
"There was a gunfight, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," the source said, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the Lightning unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of people from our intelligence services, from special forces,” he said.
He also denied that the ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle with the hijackers on board, killing six, including a Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The Quiet Majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on financing culture fills the pages of the newspaper with inch headlines and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to pry the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological digs, and national monuments that are starving to death?
Which politician would dare remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the case of our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in synergy.
In Québec, a federation of societies for the history of Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers joined together in 211 societies for history, monuments, archives, and genealogy seek to uncover history, preserve a heap of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few pennies.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, who, driven by hopelessness, protest when promoters and leaders drop their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the tribune for history and monuments?
The Benelux government will take over the state of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will help Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to be in trouble due to the growing impact of the US mortgage crisis, by partial nationalization: the three countries will support a money and insurance institution, which also has a capital stake in Hungary, with a sum of 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to enter a major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this matter could be seen as precedents in some respects.
In terms of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy out almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank will sell some of its equity holdings with absolute certainty, especially the insurance activities purchased last year from Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Bank Fortis shares began to fall sharply last week, in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of the crisis in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company’s securities fell 12 percent to a 14-year low on Friday alone.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group’s total market capital value is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to the company’s leaders.
The company’s management blames the collapse of Fortis’ shares for the uncertainty in the overseas market associated with the adoption of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the shares rose slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the head of the bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has so far signed up.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There was no panic among the bank’s clients, and the branches were not taken by attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's data on drug purchases, often deny the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with an applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescribing data in any case with the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to a fox," Richard Dick, the author of the drug-prescribing monitoring program, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make premiums and the amounts paid in the event of an insured event depend on the health status of the applicants, and if the risk is assessed as too high, they will not even conclude insurance with it.
Previously, they sent those concerned for medical examinations and only concluded the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, a customer from pharmacies can easily find out what drugs the person has purchased in the last year and a half, from which the program itself draws, how he suffers from the disease and what his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to the fact that he has practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in the category with a higher risk.
Several versions of the program are in circulation, some also determine the risk factor, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company except for paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-increasing factor, while the first mentioned difficulties are not.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, special companies have been created, which, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, will ask the patient for permission.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their negligence so far.
Recently, some companies are also processing the results of laboratory tests, which combine with data on the medicines used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, at the same time controlling their use will become more and more difficult.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to health care providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give the authorities the power to control even companies specializing in data provision, is before Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his programme so that the transfer of data is bound by the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can hardly refuse the permit in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So chickens are, after all, somewhat reliant on the falcon of goodwill.
The Global Marseille Menu
EU and India to double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, this topic has also dominated the agenda of the Ninth Summit, among other, mainly global, issues.
Today, the French-Indian summit will also be held, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power, which should be given more opportunity to speak on international issues, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been further discussed at yesterday's, already ninth, summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the European Union, the President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that the turnover of trade will double in five years, or increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
With exchanges of goods rising from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally aligned, so that air transport has become green in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy said the talks would be speeded up.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU’s partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, in all its forms, was condemned by both sides and called for an expedited convening of a UN conference.
They also urged the end of the Doha round of trade talks, although both have contributed greatly to its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as to the need to conclude a global agreement at the next climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
Both sides would also like to avoid rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister arrives in the French capital on Monday, where he plans to close a trade deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that French companies will receive the mandate to build India’s <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement will be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition area.
It will be followed by a press meeting at Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is still decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
The plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada.
The debris was found on a single plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that remained: “The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure that this is exactly where Steve Fossett flew the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) said an investigation team had been dispatched hours after the wreckage was identified, identifying the plane as a Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of primaries.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, the world flew in an airplane and without landing.
Among his many records is also a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born from the "compact" jeeps of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a vortex of news to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that the unexpected and unconventional communication that accompanies the launch of the Suv Glk will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign that accompanies the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan’s main business class, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will leave the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its trifles to recompose into a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which, in truth, has never done excessive problems so far.
She never even met the opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact, few) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-color flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they removed them so that they are not recognized.
Inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc has given Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in the name, so easy to control.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the on-going Dasla, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previously committed offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to the fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer enter any stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more will be added to the more than one hundred and fifty.
“We need to put out this fire right now and not justify those who behave in this way,” Viminal said.
So, "clearly open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Lech."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday, Casms, who can count on even one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"Chorus Leaders and Tensile Arms during Mameli's Hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who for a few weeks is the director of the Vimin<0xC3><0xA1>lsk<0xC3><0xBD> Osservatorio (he won the place that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a questor in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but, of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” Osservatorska adds, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
Until now, this group has remained within limits, now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate it for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistles at Mameli’s hymn: it’s not a crime either, but if you allow it, it’s rudeness.”
