Republican strategy to resist Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of electoral falsification in the United States are rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have been enacting laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting voting rights in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of his will, and deprive citizens with criminal convictions of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills obliging voters to present photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government body.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Electoral students who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
The same states, however, allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the credentials issued by these clubs for voting.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting.
This is the first time such a requirement has been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American people.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This restriction did not go without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to add about 10 million citizens to the lists.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws aimed at shortening the early voting period.
During the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's total electorate.
The same thing happened to people from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, only 46% of those who voted early were white.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were vetoed by the Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules, which came into force, will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats denounce the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing them as an obvious focus on influencing the 2012 election results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, a PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, false negatives and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly undergoing medical examination, there is something to doubt even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the obtained data are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates in those who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of follow-up, that the likelihood of metastasis is 30-40% higher in those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking a test starting at age 50, or at age 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a threat to life in the long run, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we are determining with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
I would recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it’s also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not you should take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate all the pros and cons of passing the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that number would rise to at least 50%,” said André Bollier, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to people’s health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said André Bollier, a spokesman for the French government.
A encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the association added.
Foods
The association also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the association said.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at the moment, the results of these studies can not be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give contradictory results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer, vitamin D is also not completely clear.
However, Mr. Beaulieu stressed that it was important to discuss your concerns and family history with the doctor.
"The passing of the analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, the report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused a real stir - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much or little.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or at least the "least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not been discovered experimentally before.
But physicists are not quite sure that it is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although for complete certainty some data is not yet enough.
Let's imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law that is absolutely inevitable, that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of a similar nature in it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermions, who prudently obey the Pauli principle.
In the other are the bosons, a vile band of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, which means that they can calmly find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "particles of force", through which the main forces of nature are distributed and to which the Higgs boson in some way belongs.
These same bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it’s because of one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “particle of light,” which is the “courier” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “breaks” the electromagnetic field at that particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of the "force carriers".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken".
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large stone.
That’s why we need a huge particle accelerator like the one operated at CERN – the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! – to achieve such huge energies.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not.
So, what can all these studies “bring” to you, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to detect a discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of SM.
In addition, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be discovered, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to “new physics” and shut some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But so far, such differences have not been found in CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, pioneers of laser research in Bell’s labs could not have even guessed what kind of revolution their work would cause.
They anticipated their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not originally intended, now serves as the “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die...
The Commission for a Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon, and at this time a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Debt" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a delay of two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloya, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at the table, on which there is an appetizing dinner, he gives up and agrees to be helped to take food.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before an ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
“Over the course of our lives, we are taught that a man should urinate standing up,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois shelter.
Regressing to a child’s condition is an unbearable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability to accept the decline,” he says.
Since, according to many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care facility are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more care, called “medical.”
Mrs. A., 89, is most afraid of dying "in consciousness from suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to get to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in my life,” she says before allowing herself to wear a mask that eases her breathing.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the shelter Victor-Gadbois with the help of a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one place in palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all going to die.
Here life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it’s physical, emotional, or emotional.
To the dying, we will agree to give a mouthful of brandy or pepsi, as long as he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank this beer in the legs of the deceased.
“We help loved ones, as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadbois, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast to him, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois Shelter and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec’s health care system that causes many palliative care practitioners to fear enacting a law legalizing euthanasia and aiding suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, has been circulating and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid that patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists to the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Helen Richard's hopes for survival were already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me she regretted that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not complying with their request, after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
People who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to feel better.”
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and Italian mafia experts tell day after day what they know about the colossal “system” entanglement of the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
The “industry” that has been very expensive for Quebec’s taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It is curious how this system falls apart after all the means have been put into practice,” jokes Jacques Duchesneau, MP and former chief of police of Montreal.
It was thanks to him that the scandal erupted in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the then Prime Minister of the Liberals, Jean Charet, very reluctantly agreed.
Duchesneau’s report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties, and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonneau Commission has “already removed two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will be able to “discover the schemes behind the individuals.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Anti-Corruption Standing Unit, established in 2011, was joined by an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, moreover, the employees of the special unit “Molot”, which after 2009 forced the “waste cartel” of Montreal, to stop overestimating the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next up is Gilles Wayancourt, who recently resigned from the post of mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, an official indictment was filed against several engineers of the Montreal Transport Service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a mafia-affiliated broker who, in turn, transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trumble's party United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito diverted money to the right and left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals, who were then in power.
He also confessed to illegally raising funds for former Liberal Party Deputy Prime Minister Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the cost was overstated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totaling $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they received on the paw, overestimating the bills by 30-40% with the help of fake supplements.
Then one of the mayor’s party organizers, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party’s cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, immersing Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first lawmakers in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re de Prairie County in the east of the island, she has been confronted since 2010 with the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of Dirty Money in Election Campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, she will “pull the string to understand the functioning of the system infused with ants to stop the gangrene and identify the culprits.”
This process is described as “painful but positive”.
We are in the process of cleansing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and an observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we cleaned the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that “officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of “elected officials who knew about this scheme” but did not participate in the frauds.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 to parties, but he says that will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and party financing: “We cannot go down below; boldly getting into the essence of things, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh to look in their own backyard.
"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"
This season at PSG you have achieved an extraordinary range.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not on fire.
From the very beginning, at the NIF Pre-School Centre in Clermont-Fontaine and before my arrival in Saint-<0xC3><0x89>tienne, I always stepped forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
The addition of this summer is not a novelty to play games of a very high level.
They also know that every workout is important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, wants to be on the level and put up to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti is supporting my positioning.
He is helped by substitutes like Claude Macelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Yeah, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all technical staff.
He has no equal in the Premier League and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
I had a good conversation with him in January.
I had a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took our place as the leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified for one-eighth of the final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We will be able to speak face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to take the rematch in one-eighth final.
Will PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position in the long term.
It's not like that today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
Not to take the title in the First League, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship.
We were close to that last season.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troy and still find something to criticize, of course, it’s a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to today’s challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has not been able to make it to the one-eighth finals for two seasons, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amounts, we represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who were not at the top last season, were “awakened” by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties, the result is that we won.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
And what if they say that there is some kind of “gold addiction”.
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's a disappointment.
I really wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking some playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I am able to play good qualifying matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must act exemplary.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Desham headed by the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
Who was Laurent Blanc?
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc reached his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) torn out on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This game has given us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, a political vision is obvious: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol of the BitTorrent type, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for making donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s exchange rate, peaking at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell five months later to $2 before returning today to around $10 (the exchange rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world’s exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used to promote in video games, which are earned in the course of the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously bookholders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, receives the privilege of adding this new line.
We are talking about the hashing phase of the file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) would want to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by up to one hundred million, which leaves another reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and Bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noise, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payments company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, allow it.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
The "giant sales" were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Ion Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noise, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which in this way comes out cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, Pierre Noise said, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB’s report proposes to revise the various risks that are now considered to be heightened if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. should follow suit at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying only on us.
We were mainly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, both wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was under the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, but they will be gone as soon as the West becomes more sensitive.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the gloom of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved these days.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into dealers, capturing state land, to resell it for construction to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who will not want to return either to the gloom of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and which are watched everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who waged the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore provincial troops that would not submit to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be somewhat decentralized, modelled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially in the run-up to the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
This only heightened the feeling that Western countries were there only to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper in place, without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the vast Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that, one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, should also restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "military-civilian activity" service under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountainous areas.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in the area of arable land.
What will we leave in memory of ourselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work coming from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign factions, which the farmers, as they told me, wished for, it was necessary to provide them with a little non-military support, which would be well controlled and would come directly to them.
Difficult Births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky step by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he has decided to play va-bank.
Surprisingly, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions, for two years now.
This new initiative only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic delusion”, continuing “to violate this word” and “to trample on the right”.
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an expedited vote resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I retain extraordinary powers”, which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, reserve participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... the time for prayer, since some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were incorrectly set.
The text, which was voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 eventually remained identical to the article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of Sharia are the main source of law.”
Salafist parties, for whom the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” say the liberals, who see it as nothing but PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular with regard to verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomiet, this is alarming, because “people who are called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can see the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals, moreover, are excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“There is currently no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system," Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition, reassures.
But he admits that “there may be ambiguity around Article 220, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to “fiqh” [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to decide on this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will take place not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Also, the trial of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered detrimental to freedom.
Blasphemy remains a liability, and insults are now banned, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom.
In addition, none of the articles is more about protecting women, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive aspect is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Navel of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the pristineness of nature.
AiF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this “bath” receives God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the holy places in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Way of Tribulation or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony, the Pretoria, where there was a trial, and in the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointing and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Navel of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected on the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is the most sacred place for Jews - the Wailing Wall, left of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave here notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above ocean level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can reach them in their own way.
The rest are brought to this historic peak by a cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus delivers to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to all of them on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
You should also visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exposition includes paintings by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Ban museum, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with murals of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique part-Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dal<0xC3><0xAD> and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are flickering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healing
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below the level of the ocean.
The azure water in it is brine, easily holding on to the water even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around are unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with salt water - rapeseed, and healing mud, and treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to put in order the shattered nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they also lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street "your" sign, Fortune will become benevolent.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists on note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know the Russian language.
It is better to take money for the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the country's only metro line, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
In fact, it's an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop working.
On Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish humus paste, a variety of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - phalale, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fed cats that valyazhno "walk on their own."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlyks love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance is $15 a day.
A bicycle rental will cost 15 s. per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest the most.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" to Moscow will lead: migrants save money on the language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law on mandatory language testing will give, scammers have already appeared in the country, selling "lippy" certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left behind.
On December 1, the law came into force, according to which every labor migrant will be obliged to pass the exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and communal services, households and retail.
However, over time, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, it will be necessary to surrender not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed in order to obtain and to renew a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
They are not subject to the law and people who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of testing was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times had time to ask the press: what, in fact, will it give?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service answer - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, language-skilled, without a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, - Sebelev is sure, - the future migrant is doomed to face dishonest people, who under the guise of help will shove him "a way" into a terrible narrow barracks, where he and dozens of others will linger for months without food and documents, incubating 12-14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“At home, they are promised one thing, and upon arrival they are deceived, they take passports, they do not pay the promised salary,” said Tolib Sharipov, the head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Justice of Tajikistan.
Don't argue, you bastard!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to earn money in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country in which they seek, but also on their own, write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even an intelligent primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention to dress them decently, put them on and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity go to earnings.
It is difficult if the language is poor, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
The tests will only be carried out for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Aliens are forbidden to enter"
Many of the visitors claim that getting an official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it turned out that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several "Lipid" certificates of passing language tests have already been seized by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, hoping to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice the cost of the official testing procedure: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
In the fact that the main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “shells” could not just be bought, both the authorities and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise those who failed to successfully pass the test from the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into account the illegal arms market
Proportion of crimes with legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to press the shots at weddings, when there were no victims, and the massacre staged by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people died.
Police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and raise the age from which you can get a gun license - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be made to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by “twisting the nuts”.
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the lawyer-forensicist Vasily Lesnikov to the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, for six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while for the same period, 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not put the criminal to go to the “black” market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” market of weapons is replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site accepting orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military trace", that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“Weapons were carried by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets said.
The next type of “black weapon” is stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes those taken from police depots and those stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "guns" go on sale from military warehouses.
There were frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
“There are proven versions that part of the arson was done specifically to cover up the shortage,” the former military man said.
According to Baranac, weapons manufacturers contribute.
“Private weapons factories are now being spawned, which cannot withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from the floor to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are especially many guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its own production, sometimes handicraft, and a mafia formed, which organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where did the weapon come from?
Experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public-Management Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapons topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there “by officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of production of weapons, 5% are accounted for by "black archaeology".
A dealer-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked not to give his name, assures that the weapons found by black diggers, no one has been buying for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, for a new batch of sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through the ensign, a person buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
He's being discharged, passed through the fence.
"He's transporting her to the city and here he's selling 900 euros apiece with two stores," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when a crime detection plan is on fire, they conduct a control purchase from illegal arms dealers,” the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a comrade responded, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya", where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner", where we will trade.
I only found out the price of the gun there.
Military columnist Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about him.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a few cassettes through someone I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Ex-military Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album with "anything" on it.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranza, does not offer a cat in a bag - you can try everything.
I, as a potential customer, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there put a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon hits well, we start bargaining,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet bring to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - they write in an advertising cap on the site "Buy a combat gun or a machine gun."
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will it be sold to minors?
"Without a license of course," - asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is saved).
"Buy TT.Moscow" - concisely formulates the request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and wanting to buy a combat weapon rows with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then mine coal in Siberia
Military observer and former military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapon is hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO “Right to Arms”.
Victor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can remain without weapons and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and wanting to buy a combat weapon rows with a shovel.
“People go like hungry fish to feed, and then mine coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can save in the amount of from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Right to Arms", Makarov's gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these middle-level warehouses.
According to official statistics of the department, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the U.S. strike workers fast food and supermarkets
The McDonald’s cash register is used by up to a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days, a wave of protests has swept across America against low wages in Walmart’s department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
As long as no one dares to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that Walmart employees and the fast food system receive, the purpose of the protest organizers is to create trade unions in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when an orgy of cheap sales fell on America, capturing millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by fights.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed along with trade unions and left-wing activists the stores of the Corporation, whose goods are designed for people of modest and middle-income.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart employees only work at their jobs.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheaper in part because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or manual scanners.
Shareholders on Black Friday demanded a pay rise and lamented that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
To a typical Walmart employee who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is out of pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $ 3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than she’s spending on her salary right now.
If Walmart completely shifts the growth of wages to the shoulders of buyers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Supporters of Walmart quite note that the protests occurred in only nine states and did not inflict any damage to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in her stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Corporation spokesman Dan Vogelman claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was merely “another PR stunt” by the union that organized it.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where they were targeted not by Walmart department stores (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but by McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that, it doesn’t even give you hospital bills and doesn’t pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average their ordinary employees receive $ 8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
How to live in New York for that kind of money is incomprehensible to me.
At one time, almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald's, who worked for their counters after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly come across interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the forum of the Wall Street Journal, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Protesters at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade union activists with pickets and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But to cover the union fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary flow of personnel.
Disagree
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the rally was a rally at McDonald’s near Times Square in the middle of the day, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, City Council member Jumaine Williams, who said: “McDonald’s says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn’t even give you hospitals and pay you for your honest work!”
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, supported the protesters, saying that "we must join together in supporting fast-food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, and not all of them were employees of the fast-food community, which in New York employs tens of thousands of people.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will give rise to the flame of mass movement.
"For the time being, cheating on the brain is average."
The topic of augmented reality, popular among fans of modern technology, has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, in the summer at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was filed by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D-technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi it follows that for the scientists of this company glasses - the stage passed.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Can you tell me what your research team is doing?
“We are dealing with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes ticking them with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else awaits us?
Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very much.
We are trying to change that, working on true three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to inform others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sloppy gestures, but about such meager, short gestures.
At the same time, the gestures were removed not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this soda can?
You will tell and show at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow you to more accurately determine human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
“In principle, the current generation is something that we can build on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it’s not about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the resolution of the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our Redmond Laboratory made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, but it does not require touch, so that the frames per second were larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second - a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, a normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in the three-dimensional definition of the position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk around, holding the smartphone in high hands is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transient" augmented reality, when based on the cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and beyond everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (private things see only you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from "Iron Man", but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tactile feedback!
My hands can't feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's great at recording push-ups!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" touch - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is, gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you are stuck on pads.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to fool your brain?
To make him think that he feels what he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is another task that remains to be fought for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very limited space believe that he is going on an open, almost endless - we are also working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While cheating the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very much for many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to a researcher – many things are absolutely in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “Petersburg Avant-garde”, dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the scathing artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, who meets then at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable parties and vernissages.
Paintings by Kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets, causing a smile at the citizens, raising everyone's mood.
Recently, he took up the charm and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as a fashion designer, engaged in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although in society everything that is almost gray, causes aggression and arousal of bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and the new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I began to be friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazon region, which led to the Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
It throws me into the theater, clothes, music, in all genres except the word.
- And all this united in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory of Pushkinskaya-10, and there, while there was no repair, there was a music and art club, a Bohemian club, the house of St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tequila jazz, I remember how Cord was brought with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
The cord and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in a tightening shirt, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137", Griboyedov club - echoes from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I'm the hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was named me, ended my climax.
In the new times, it is uncomfortable to work according to the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is recognizable.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, The Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being so is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything is blurred, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian change of clothes in order of order.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't get his hand in his face and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you as a city charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, should be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, tactical, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people flocked to the packs, the bohemian loved one, the simpletons the other.
Now everyone has broken into micro-communities, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to get everybody to like it.
Now you have to think about who will like you.
Now each iconic hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes for several thousand!
- It's where the sex and social spheres work.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end, less management, money, everything will fade.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the acquired.
I painted such paintings in my youth that one collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the pictures that usually end.
Now often confused concepts.
They say: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up on the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting.
I am for that kind of culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing as an official of culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, it was not so, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are shifted, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are such artists who should look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
It is difficult to grow art on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this thin layer.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with St. Petersburg grant
Birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue their kind in the conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAISH).
But if on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - the excretion in orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophile.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to space to test how the embryo develops under weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem associated with the fact that this chick must find support, he must stand on his feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
Unable to find support, the chicks squirmed indiscriminately.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, after that we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - Vladimir Sychev notes the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
With animals, the last time a biological "minikovcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with the fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - this is a single experiment, and such studies should be conducted," - said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitual habitat, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
Humans, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would survive after the flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"No one answered this question," said space veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolaev was also an cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice in orbit and even worked in outer space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are a few astronauts, who after long flights cost everything, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights," sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC hydrolab is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts practice their skills in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for infants - a native element.
Little Ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's occipital fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says infant swim instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a born child, then gravity, the force of gravity, is necessary for a woman.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, decreases the ability to push the fetus.
All right, let's lower that by relying on birth stimulants.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go to childbirth, she will push him out.
"And then what?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the earth, the body will not form a skeleton and muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," - predicts the head of the committee on bioethics IMBP RAS Igor Pestov.
While the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthlings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Main Control and Audit Office: The check of the black system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kal, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktualno.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack,” Kala said.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nechas's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited.
Recently, the prime minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then the prime minister can not resist the work of institutions, which are charged with the duty to verify and enforce their obligations,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel test that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation states how public procurement should take place, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with the still unfinished verification, interesting differences were found - in simple terms, the legislation in our country can be "accurate and unmistakable", but in practice, we are inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you, what does it mean for you?
It is such joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop clarifying laws, reducing and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the limit on orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with “papers” so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As far as the institutions are concerned, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is our principle, and there is also a college that works a little differently, but basically both institutions operate in the same way.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounting Chambers.
As for the local legislation, is it easier than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but it cannot be definitely said that it is better in everything.
Is it because they are better at controlling?
Certainly not, but I repeat, I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, do the consequences manifest themselves in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we started using our new tool "detecting the risk of uneconomy", through which we drove almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will bring benefits or additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will “harden” and will not be enforced.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are associated with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called black system. What does this mean?
Is the "Swartz system" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies charged with the duty to verify and enforce obligations.
You can say, “We will change this law and allow it,” but you can’t say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules on how and what should be formally carried out, and it is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
Mostly they are passable, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning, in the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were paved, but somewhere frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be slightly warmer.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently accessible without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are passable.
But on some of their sites there are still remnants of frozen and places of overcrowded snow.
You need to be especially careful on the roads located on the hills.
Pardubice and Kralovegrad region
The management of roads and motorways of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads of the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on the mountain roads and roads located on the hills, there may be a covered layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about the ice, which can form especially on the hills of the Pardubice region.
Holodeck can be near Lanshkroun, Usti nad Orlici, Shelchik, Svitavi or Vysoké Mito especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located near Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlicky Mountains.
The covered snow layer is located on the roads located on the hills in the areas of Rykhnov nad Knezhnou and Trutnov.
In the east of the Czech Republic today, there is a variable cloud with no precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region this morning passable, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is cold, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In places, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now almost unlimited, however, road managers recommend to exercise caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south of Pilsen and Tahov, frozen areas can be found.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning about the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-used roads in the area of <0xC5><0xA0>umava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the hills of the Olomouc region today should take into account the snow porridge on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervonogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsk Krzy<0xC5><0xBC>.
At night, snow forced road workers to go out, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other areas of the road edge, as a rule, pass without restrictions.
"On the heights of the Sumperk lies the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle," the traffic controller of Sumperk road management told the Czech News Agency (CHAN) today.
At night, their colleagues from Jesenik went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after treatment with chemicals remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberg, drivers should be attentive to forest areas where humidity still remains.
Ustetsky Krai, Liberetsky Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are still a few hard-to-pass places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to a few places with ice or fallen snow, a mountain road was closed on the site from Telnice in the Clinic in the Ust'ecki region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Czech Srednjegorje, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Szczeti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - all day it rained and melted snow, at night the sky brightened and frost began.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 road on the border of the Ustecky and Liberetsky krai.
Because of the branches of trees, which were bent under the snow, related to the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnice on Kninice.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It’s just one of the many disturbing news that we humans get so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about this and saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about this?
We are talking about a nationwide fundraising event, which we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts will start in parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus support us at the same time.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also sang the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world is canceled".
Will the already beloved YouTube listeners sound the anthem at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if everything works out and the world does not end.
It is sung by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be played live on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by the role of Jesus in the video by Tomasz Ganak, also participates in the performance of Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl Xindl...
How did you start working with them?
We also collaborate with other people of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds of the concert against the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the Tap civil association at the Jedlicka Institute.
The teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Jedlicka Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and in this way we try to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Jedlichka Institute in the future, a separate building will arise, in which we will move with this project.
At each concert will perform several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would interest all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suhi will perform.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grand events” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
As for abroad, you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It’s not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and tool boxes.
However, while coping with it without problems. Czech airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
By going abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have seen that in the east it is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and here it is still a wonder to self-move a person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there are no such trivial things as giving way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities move on their own on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-free is one thing, but the moment we get famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything really starts to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular now, but let’s go back two years, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute as a teacher, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I organized an interesting musical circle together with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our presenter Ladja Angelovic says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has the popularity only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It’s true, we were helped by the fact that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate, in fact, as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things imitating each other.
It is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural...
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is a shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Has it been successful because you are a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do the job qualitatively, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
There's only one Ladja Angelovic.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - at the Fleda Club and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by telemetry at the time of the performance of the song by the band The Tap Tap "The end of the world is canceled".
The goal of this project is to raise 25 million crowns for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 CZK, for children under 12 years of age admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a European Space Agency ministerial meeting, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has actively participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights into space, but this was not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Louis Hirsch Prize for "Introduction to Space".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway track was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket had to be used to accelerate or brake the truck.
Information about this thresher is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Section of Armament Technology in cooperation with professors Me<0xC4><0x8D>islav Wolfke and Gustav Mok<0xC5><0xBE>icki.
From the surviving materials, it is clear that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, work was interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter missile, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared, and the following year, the work "Air torpedo rocket and aviation rocket bomb" by author Lelyva-Kzhivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects of military use of missile technology were handled by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory-Naukowy Committee), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity the work was terminated due to the outbreak of the war.
The next scientific work devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal "Problems", which publishes four volume articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in space exploration.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the fall of the POA became its full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the POA, Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902-1959), became the deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful Meteorological Rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested at Bledowskyi Void.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could cover 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aviation developed the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
It will undoubtedly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wage), price tensions arise.
By this concept one must understand the state when the producer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to withstand economic competition by “beating” the cost of a competitor in order to take away most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearing, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where the cost of labor is high compared to others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditures of the state on social needs grow.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they inflict in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Unceremoniously methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual states a situation when governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own populations to private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to economically compel its people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for reducing workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is an increase in poverty and, at the same time, the difference between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, for several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra to get a living wage.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on a poor salary at the back of society in the hope that someday private investment capital will come to the country.
The question is, where will it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue to nausea that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by governing actions.
Next, the question should be answered whether private capital, which is now practically managing politics and the entire state, is not acting for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a desperate situation, manifested in corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everything deserves to be punished, but it is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financially powerful groups preferring their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy now quickly finds itself in such a situation, as described by Appian in The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey: “The state has long been disintegrating, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Takeovers, illegal receipt of favors with the help of stones and swords.
Profiteering and corruption prospered without any prohibitions, and the people themselves went to the elections with a pre-sold vote""...the decent people did not run for the post of ruler at all, after all, one day the state remained without a consul for eight months." .. "They seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic man.
As in antiquity, our own reckless interests predominate in modern society without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended to be used for public purposes.
The current result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes we must look for in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic in nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and never will" - Sting, the song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain are the words: "We do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, they wouldn’t exist.” – Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has generated many responses.
Some advocate for Israel by arguing that it has the right to self-defense, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians by arguing with the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is credited with the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who, in these periodic waves of killings, is the criminal and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation and did not witness the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who has served above all the tensions that have lasted for 95 years (as of the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasonings are backed up by historical facts, some of them derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their own steps completely independently, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be admitted that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have occurred in the lifetime of a generation.
Among the astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered as the head of the strudel (I do not know if anyone stands above them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They don’t write much about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) as early as the nineties of the 19th century to stop rumors linking their name to criminal activities in the higher realms in which they were shadowed, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the augmentation of wealth, or both.
They have large stakes in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries in which they do not have a stake, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took over the central bank of their country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the central bank behind the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began issuing his own (understood - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their thirst for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars created by the great Freemason of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially of Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prelude to such a project).
The method by which a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds work is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, which was supposed to prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, the fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, and creating a precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was only left to throw the Germans a strong enough, condemning the guilty and offering simple solutions to the Leader, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong one.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
When World War II broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or whether everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a focal point for World War III.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will be the victims of fighting on the front line, now with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers incite people to vote exclusively for their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the hawk of Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to develop into a world conflict, and given Iran’s control over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of the world.
David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
The new world order in their view is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he causes all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves to be branded on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name cannot buy or sell.
This is wisdom: anyone who has reason can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of a man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
The movie “Operation Argo”: When there is nowhere worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The US administration was not expected to have a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could have fundamentally undermined the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later amplified by a failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, “Operation Argo” describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult vicissitudes, they ended their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover legend, according to which they drove on Canadian passports as members of the filming group, looking for a place in the country to shoot a sci-fi epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, invented by Evacuation expert Tony Mendes, required Hollywood’s cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, held press conferences, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The Affleck film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-cineopus", the story of a successful venture, a scam - an example can be a number of films about friends of Ocean.
The moods in the film are constantly changing - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the titles show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck has managed to relaunch his career.
The ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film that is not filmed in the director's hometown of Boston.
The sense of place at the same time refers to the qualities that raised earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it at Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when the story suddenly changes somewhere.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues achieve in the scenes fictitious (fake headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a lot of exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He is quite successful with this few, sometimes he thinks something - there it all turns out not so elegant (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and chasing on the runway look quite far-fetched).
The disadvantage of “Argo” is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro style, recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind of one, still in a certain sense living history, as well as to testify to the exaggeration of ideas about omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services.
Balloon Inflating Rules, Bananas and Circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decree or project from the EU workshop".
“We were prompted by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of major European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organiser of the survey.
Among the absurdities that have already been put forward for nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will be held until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU’s controversial directives include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which is detrimental to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermostats just because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a cage for chickens, resulting in a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
Also criticized was the factual ban on the use of the term "bread oil" or the removal of classic bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes decisions under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic is now even under threat of veto defending the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union were supposed to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "abnormal curvature".
At the same time, the Commission justified itself by merely harmonising existing divergent national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite resistance from some states, has nevertheless relaxed standards for fruit and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives will lead to waste of products.
A candidate for the poll could also be last year's EU regulation, according to which the balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight can not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to U.S. research, according to which balloons when playing are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are prohibited from blowing into fair windmills.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is absurd enough: anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but should instead say "BYURM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplateky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food reserves in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said then-Agriculture Minister Yaroslav Palace (CFDP) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high grain harvest in the country, and as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles that had to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for the subsidy were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavlo Nemec (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be used to prepare an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre orders are the exception
While rulings in member states are easily criticized, EU efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve rather recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States achieved when discussing the budget.
The fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition, arouses emotions among the Czechs.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians retained the name "Olomoucky cheeses", however, "Tusemsky rum", the traditions of which in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename it "Tusemak".
Rum can be called only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, has already been found, for example, Karlovy Vary currants, Gorzhelitsky and Tr<0xC5><0xBE>ebonsk<0xC3><0xBD> carp and hops.
Also, the EU trade mark can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Gor<0xC5><0xBE>ice tubes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to run for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or a president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how the country has been robbed over the past 20 years, how thieves are swarming around here, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and an independent person, not belonging to any party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I have always said that I will be involved in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can implement my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the widest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation murmur in our bar or at the TV, but we are ready to trample anyone who tries to change something.
To this is added the media, which denigrates the person, and which confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's get to your point of view.
You started the fight for the presidential castle with theses about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about reverse property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
In order to do this, the law needs to be changed.
As president, you have no such powers, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for excursions to become a free enterprise, it was possible to promote it.
The problem is politics – when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately obstructed, and that restrains citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without having to be partisan on the shelves, without looking at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer to me more to the left.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not that someone belongs to the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for the society whether it will be proposed by the HRCM or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But do you not prove it by what you have said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
This is what you are trying to get closer to.
This can be called populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are being talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will only have slogans.
You won’t last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side, so that we can achieve ours.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong personality that voices abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am only a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I’m trying to move things forward on my own; if that doesn’t work out, I’ll be back in the private sector in six years.
In part, it sounds like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I went around a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorentsova, who uncovered the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that changes would be difficult to implement.
In spite of this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to test the purity of each potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money to do it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, my transparent account is only twenty thousand crowns.
You don't have any money?
You talk about property declarations, and how are your own affairs with it?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million, well, a few million more in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin came to me because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, own $60 million worth of property, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money especially in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I get in debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program isn’t that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign costs will essentially be covered by the senator's salary.
But I wouldn’t live with that money, for example, I wouldn’t be able to pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for office.
So you're going to continue to do business so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut back on that?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, the managing director of a travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be the silversmith who will keep the republic.
But I also need something to live on.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which is what I get.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday issue of the newspaper "Pravo".
The architects of MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speikenisse and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lisette Verheig, passing by on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, says, “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad, and e-books.
Now no one goes to such old-fashioned libraries voluntarily anymore, right?
Speikenisse, an inconspicuous sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesque painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had only one chance to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Winnie Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, master of bold column diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual serenity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury members looked puzzled and shrugged their shoulders, the daring Maas put together a pyramid of size from his original gift and concluded the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Speikenisse, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the contest "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, a faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of a dairy plant, became richer on one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly - in Speikenisse appeared the first in the history of this city public building for cultural purposes.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: a book Eldorado under a cheese cap.
There is only one elevator passing in the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glazed on all sides, the room is light and easily visible, the floors of the burnt brick and elegant street lights unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
Look involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
“Usually, book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of space on its head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The internal space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Black bookshelves are especially pleasing, which serve as wall decoration, railings, and stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guessing what kind of unknown material it is.
“We sought to work with secondary materials,” explains Joep Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once, at an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been used as a lining under the roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be discarded.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was compressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little shoe.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who crosses a path nearly 500 meters long will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wooden ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The Cost of a New Soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trowborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun only gets inside for a short time.
Wide farms made of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was already here.
As well as the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Buckenberg "the soul of Speikenisse, which has long been lacking".
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to occupy empty seats on the shelves of the not yet fully equipped library - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are up.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vinnie Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, now every resident is somehow connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speikenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for identity building.
Szabo: “The Germans should play a more important role”
Germany abstained in the vote to recognize Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians’ request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why not?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO carried out this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from the policy, which, so to speak, was governed by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent common policy.
Thus, the Germans find themselves again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only tapping their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or Britain pursues.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
This is a willingness to take a position that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are largely different from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t give it too much importance, it’s not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic a blunder as it was in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are differing views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has spoken out for a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of U.S. domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, can not openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not at all as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and its position as the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a unified, non-contradictory European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are instead forced to act on their own vision of the situation.
This is what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won’t it really take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German sentiments are manifested.
The Germans don’t just deal with it.
In fact, this is an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, then who remains?
The Germans just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don’t like it, it’s unpleasant or intensifies your dislike for you – that’s life!

Trademark Protection in China: When Puma and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
What is the Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
However, it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
There's a new case of this kind on my desk every week.
It is enough for imitators to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
This is how Gucci turns out to be Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the Trademark Registration Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
However, the cases of Pattloch are not like this. On the instructions of his creditors, he opposes the fact that Chinese enterprises officially receive from the trademark registration office the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai", a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not admit guilt.
“It’s hurting business, and we need to fight it,” Pattloch said.
"The brand is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, is the third largest and fastest-growing luxury market.
However, it is difficult to get rid of dubious entries in the trademark registry, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about the cases in which the court rejected the claims, because after a long time the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as it caused damage to his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, an enterprise that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to a Mercedes star.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, in which the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The Trademark Registration Office of CTMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to lack of staff and equipment.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency in the work process to normal”.
Thus, the number of pending cases on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting this is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to protest it, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator enshrined Chinese trademark rights to Freudenberg.
This was an own omission, as surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trademark registration office of CTMO rejected the Munichers’ claim.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues the fight so far.
We need to be vigilant
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves from us.”
Internal costs are scarcely accountable, the firm’s archives had to review even acts of a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party “a large six-digit sum in euros” for a settlement.
“It’s clear from here how expensive this is for us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Namely, if imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent registration.
“We need to be careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions, rather foreigners should “everything that is somehow worth protecting should also be registered in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay license fees to the opposing party for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we will be driven out of the market in the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: Stumbling, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice in it.
The history of relationships that have covered a distance of more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, there is a flooding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's slippers pick up a beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after this slowly increase the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they come, enchant and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his fabric shoes as he guides them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years old, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor, came to the rehearsal.
"Om" Obani" is a difficult thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, besides in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essitzheny, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take over the leadership.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means narrator or praiser.
In this room, they don't speak bantu fluently, but they can sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has taught songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Essitzheny, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected 40%
There live about 2,000 people, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants there are many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the IR virus.
In Essitgeni, the miniature reflects the disease of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest in the world life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005, but earlier Imbogni participants saw a lot of children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since taken almost professional care of AIDS orphans in Essitgeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pediculosis and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and the human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections are significantly more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
The human papillomavirus is also common among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, there may be ulcers in the genital area, complaints when urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as blisters or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, partially the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, you can cure most STIs and avoid distant consequences.
The leadership, donations and, last but not least, the fees for the performances of the choir throughout Germany allow us to collect something.
“In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Essitzheny,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also takes care that orphans are well-organized, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, is the support of the village.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and made sure that children in uniform showed up in class every day.
Those who have no family left go to the shelter of Haniyeh, a lone woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious in the whole country, prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it is associated with sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the IR virus has spread so quickly in recent years.
But it also lays on wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support cultural exchange a little, Ibmogni takes a tour of southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, incidentally, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Essitzheni, where the singers visit the children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, it is more than famous in the valley of the Eculveni River.
"Go to Essigny, there's light," say the people here.
And after a 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also on here.
NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid colliding with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other places in the solar system.
Invisibly for the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix", explore the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows in endless dahlias.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union’s new definition, is not a “planet.”
This fragment of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink “newborn” stars in the stellar circle.
This region of star formation - scientists call it unromantically W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This overflowing heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
A donut-like ring is made up of material that the star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this picture of a galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, colors get better.
How the red eye blinks the Snail Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity with the terrestrial continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color rendering.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they arose is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
These may be fragments of the moon Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: the Vortex galaxy
Depending on the color transmission, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the image shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid derives from the Latin word trifidus (three-dimensional, three-dimensional), as dark bands of dust divide the glowing heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers have photographed the forerunner of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies meet each other and inevitably collide.
This birth star Hubble telescope was photographed in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who does not like technical abbreviations can call it by the nickname “Southern Circular Wheel”.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, which is 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
A large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe mostly had hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey – even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the space available to them to look deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the “Big binocular telescope” is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the “Great South African Telescope” in South Africa is segmented – to reduce the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-emitting ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the "Very Large Telescope" - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
ESO’s Chilean Observatory is also planning to install the European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should span as much as 42 meters - and will consist of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photos should be expected no earlier than 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks up at the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
You can see them in the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system - primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Big Bang through the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the "Messenger" rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now sure of this.
Drink oil every day and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus with thunder rolls along a winding road past densely forested hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright that you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here live Talysh - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, of which little is known, except that they speak perfectly in Farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Lerik.
The small town boasts too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes 8 hours for 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
There is a biography of about eight dozen Talysh from these places, which is more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the museum’s controversial star is Shirali Muslumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, has turned 122 years old, the age of Muslumov seems extremely doubtful.
“He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973,” Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did Chaban Muslumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-lived people in Central Asia.
“Amazingly many elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, since there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of melted oil
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerick area surprisingly often reach the Biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old living here.
Why are there so many long-lived people here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with special genes of Talish.
The director of the Fatulayev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is about nutrition.
Talysh like meat, bread and mostly dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a matter of a primitive way of life that keeps people young? In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At 97 years old, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two kids nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical puzzling glasses of armoud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under her head scarf she hides long dark pink braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair milked, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never shopped in a store in my entire life.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But it became better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev got to the helm.
Propaganda does not often sound in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the nation’s father, who ruled the country as a dictator, knows almost no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the reins.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is an amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva’s long-grown son is also right: “Old people in our culture enjoy deep respect.”
They live in a big family, loved, cared for and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is missing from the constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep split in the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia has met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not run out of pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are afraid.
The fear of a religious state in the Nile is at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a Ph.D. from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles managed to drag in a nightly 15-hour hurdles race at an Islamist-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the proceedings are based on “principles of Islamic law.”
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and one fears that Islamists will use a vague formulation and the resulting legal loophole for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least, this is hinted at by one new article: in all cases concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamist institution with great authority throughout Sunni Islam, should be brought to the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in a limitation of the judicial power.
In the draft constitution, much is subject to interpretation.
Another problem is that the jurisdiction of civilians should remain with the military court.
These courts during Mubarak's rule served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were imprisoned.
The draft law also states that the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morals and values.”
Legally, this is so vague that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature.
Open text means nothing more than censorship.
No article directly establishes equality between men and women.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that “insulting people” is prohibited is also questionable.
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about the jurist?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Morsi offers for signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
“The Revolution is Back”
The opposition against the superiority of the Islamists has been forming for several weeks now.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution was "on the dump of history".
Through Twitter’s short news service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “putsch against democracy.”
“If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Yasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
“The Quran is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under veils and Salafists who shouted: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Morsi: “Clear the country!” and assured: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began provoked a state of practically civil war.
Morsi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clearly.
Now it is time for the people to decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
The majority for the Islamist project, this is considered a settled case.
"The concept of 'human rights' is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in jail or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words “human rights” never appear in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with “Welt am Sonntag”.
Morsi’s expansion of influence across all three branches of power in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president has de facto annulled it,” Saeda regrets.
Without civil society, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a retribution for that.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You’re creating a monster that you can’t control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the worst smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of this country’s success is somehow related to the local addiction to one extremely sinister fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a spiky smell of rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
Surrounded by snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but there is an inextinguishable characteristic smell in the air.
Rakfisc is trout sprinkled with salt and strewn in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of shower you need to achieve.
As twilight thickens and it gets colder, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, let’s say, exciting dish.
“It’s eaten raw and drunk with a glass of aquavit, local cumin vodka,” explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time “raffisk general” who runs the festival.
All around us, people eat fish cut into small cubes and drink it in large portions of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Howard says.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a couple of slices.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - little different from the portion of sushi that you have been carrying with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the autumn.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly frozen, it was extracted and, silencing the perception of alcohol, consumed.
In the memory of the last generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants, who are attracted by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (an old rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) come here to work.
Rakfisc is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat sinister, element of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you <0xC2><0xA3>9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country’s residents seem to be happy with it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called “the incident of July 22.”
It is very hard for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway’s current prosperity is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, carrying trays of aged raffish, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English well.
We don't like to show up, we're not bragging.
Norway handles its oil very carefully - most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was making money they didn’t have, Norway was calculating all the costs sparingly.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's a rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food, and I've had enough of rakfiska.
Here's a hamburger with moose meat - it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special dinner dedicated to the rafisk, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live TV show in which the presenter is shown in a bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what assessment did you make of the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls off the chair, maybe taking the aquavit.
Or maybe just smelling the fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto has a difficult start to his career.
As Mexican President-elect Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly dire state.
The city is overloaded with transport at its best, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting through several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will put on a presidential tie and take over the reins of the country.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, which is now laying down its powers, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s political career developed alongside the President of the United States as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Rectangular man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with holes and pits that were previously on this site.
The signs with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are connecting with him hopes for real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of inconsistency that the new president was put forward by the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very committed to embodying his vision for the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nessaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under highway overpasses, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality also bear the harsh nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to appease drug trafficking gangs in those areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
In the desert near the extensive landfill only in the last two years, several dozen bodies of murdered women were found.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State during Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto ' s governorship, well above that in the infamous city of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, whose name has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, it can be said, at best, that during his tenure as governor, he failed to cope with the problem of the murder of women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most houses in this stale neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back tears by showing me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her cohabitant killed her.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before,” recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten and her body was already stiff.
Mariana's mother retells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, which has only one word: justice.
This, they said, was denied to the family.
“State officials treated me like an old gossip, dissatisfied with a disturber of calm.
They want people to simply accept what they say and shut up.
But it is wrong, it is not possible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
Putting on the presidential tie on Saturday, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto with her will take on a difficult responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has pledged to make addressing the issue a priority during his reign.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president he was as the governor,” said Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo of the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, the indictment says.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, particular attention was paid to Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army has been accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint about ill-treatment, which he said he had been transferred while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Feyn said that the records of Manning’s weekly visits by prison administration officials for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defence's motion to terminate Manning's case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was conducted the day after Manning stated that while in custody he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, prosecutor Feyn and Manning reviewed the reports that were filled out after Manning's visits by administration officials during his time at Quantico Prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the prison administration's treatment as "excellent" and the general terms of detention as "very professionally organized".
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Feyn argues.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about these problems and that the administration who had visited had discussed them with him and had stated that they would be dealt with, but had not recorded it in writing.
“They recorded ‘no problems’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise the topic in the conversation,” Manning says.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission examining the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get rid of the “injury prevention” regime and to ease the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited regime of detention - to a level lower than the surveillance regime for the purpose of preventing suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay so they can cancel the injury prevention regime... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to the severe heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan base, to the size of my prison,” Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in this cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell—at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day—alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, hats, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime was forbidden by the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, light constantly beat into his eyes, penetrating the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned over in bed at night, then, according to him, he was awakened and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, a judge questioned Manning about a statement he made while testifying on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of security guards and other inmates at a morning checkup.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Answering the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw a blanket he could cover, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to throw it.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could have used a rubber band or flip-flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, hats and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he experienced during his detention and significantly reduce the term of detention if Manning is found guilty by the military court, which is due to begin its trial early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico under the rules governing the detention of detainees under the strictest possible regime.
The charges brought against Manning included aiding the adversary, unlawfully facilitating the disclosure of data on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information, and the theft of state property or documents.
If convicted on all counts of indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrival corridor, approached the border control area, and froze on the spot.
The signs pointed to two queues: one for Mexicans and one for Extranjeros.
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conventional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I settled on the elaborate construction of an "American of Mexican descent."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and queued up for Extranjeros.
I recalled this story a few days ago when Mexico’s newly elected President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was eager to talk about the Mexican economy’s rise, which would allow Mexicans to now, with the same success, stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a difficult and filled with old grievances.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and, with a shotgun, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is worth only some U.S. statesman to speak a word of criticism towards Mexico, the press and among the elite of Mexican society immediately spread complaints that the Americans infringe on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are full of belligerence.
Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States is the most difficult.
Do you want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone — a father or grandfather — did not have the opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - dark, low-educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
Mexico sees it differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got a good job, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We respond to them in the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as non-real Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are some frictions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans — Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican-Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations were already not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Mexico’s ambassadors and represent Mexico’s interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated in Mexico recently.
Yeah, I guess.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles in the New Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
Sounds familiar, meaningless debate about who started it; many buildings turned into ruins; killed over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians are hopelessly stuck in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have stirred up many established realities in a rebellious storm, and the Palestinians and Israelis have failed to stay away from the whirlwind that has shaken the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will be even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
A war without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give grounds for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes this week have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
Leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say they have forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders were destroyed and 1.7 million residents were blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements grows in the Arab world, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
A resurgent regional leader, Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim nations, has backed Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states in the Persian Gulf.
The triumphant supporters of Hamas declare the creation of an Islamist crescent around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king’s authorities threaten Hamas’s allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on Israel’s southern borders, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where under President Mohammed Morsi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization largely similar to Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic relations, Hamas could become a significant player, whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States has remained true to its unwavering position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the start of the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel’s economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have died from rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part at the expense of a wall that enters the territory of the West Bank - a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of supporting the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If you give them all the power in the West Bank, won’t they start firing rockets at Israel from there, as their fellow Israelis in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and firmly suppress any attempts to lift their heads.
Proponents of the hard line may win; however, their calculations may be refuted by the Arab spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere, do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel must no less take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect – the growth of the Arab population – only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
There remains the only solution that is relentlessly called for by sane representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and the concession of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long had to decide to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are more than ever in a position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama must also play a role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows a reluctance to get involved.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Cigarette Packaging Act came into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of disease-affected parts of the body stand out in contrast on the dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
Australia’s first ever law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of dull-olive color with terrible pictures of the affected body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking their parents.
In addition to various pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs introduced mandatory from this Saturday are the names of stamps that are printed in the same fine print.
These are the world’s toughest conditions for packaging tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says the aim of the measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this bad habit of fashion status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
“It’s obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies try to convey through packaging,” Health Minister Tania Plibersek explains, citing studies that show that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so these changes will not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more of these products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha from the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and expects a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After Australia passed a number of laws that made it illegal to advertise cigarettes on television and support them for sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing ads on the web, but it cannot restrict foreign websites from doing so.
“If you sell tobacco products and you only have this little loophole, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting to you,” explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of brand reviews written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not regret his efforts and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States are making claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations between all these countries and Australia are very insignificant.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory posting of photographs warning of the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively disobeying innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“Just grab a cigarette and hide the pack in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yew, the head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on shelves.
“It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, and now it takes me four hours,” he complains.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, all right, it’s over, we close the store,” he says, throwing his hands up.
Missing in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there will not much help either books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in child development speak in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
Maybe we need to be bored?
Oh, yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think that boredom was a relatively recent invention when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
“In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
The question remains, however, how do we understand boredom?
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research materials on the topic and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people “want but can’t do what would satisfy them.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn’t do something they’d like to do.
With apathy, you don’t want to do anything.
The main thing in experiencing boredom, he says, is “attention disorder and the associated mood deterioration and the feeling that time is slow.”
The description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when it’s really hard to focus on something.
In their study, “The Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the journal.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of a non-relevant television program included in the next room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign soundtrack.
Those participants who heard the low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people start rocking on a chair or drawing stunts on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study showed that children who are not forbidden to squirm and turn learn better and remember more information than children who are asked to sit quietly,” said Fenske.
At some point, we all get bored: with a flight delay (as in my case), listening to monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show a different degree of propensity for boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special "scale of propensity to boredom".
To determine the score on this scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I am too much interested, so there is not enough time for anything."
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys are more likely to miss girls, says Stephen Wodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially if there are a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers often miss.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day using a pager.
32% of teens said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what similar data on boredom would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescents have a peak in boredom,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, it can, as research shows, push people to absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling or the abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to the study of this problem.
“That’s how our brains tell us to do something else; it’s boring,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know exactly what to do.
If you’re bored and you put that energy into playing guitar or cooking experiences, you’ll make yourself better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and work,” says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom needs to be extolled.
However, it is not worth considering it as a bad thing either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
“We see it as a way to get bored more often, with boredom being an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are used to constant overstimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when silence comes, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will apply
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old footballer and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a criminal offense that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and the tube he smoked it in.
Mr. Orosco says that he was in Lamar with his friends once in September and was driving in a car on the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosko was summoned to court for possession of drugs and possession of a device for drug use - minor offences, each of which was fined $100 - and a court date was set.
“We are being treated like criminals,” says Mr. Orosko.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks since the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law, but on the place of consideration.
Accusations of minor marijuana offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken a similar action.
Police stations have already stopped prosecuting people aged 21 and older for keeping small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative counties of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to review existing marijuana-related cases and continue to hold the drug accountable.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West voted to prevent the emergence in their places of new, state-licensed stores for the sale of marijuana.
“It’s all happening so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the controlling bodies in the state of Washington are also puzzled by scratching their heads.
They will have to establish rules to determine how to license the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in resolving marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
“There’s a more orderly market in Colorado, so they’ll set a good example,” explains Brian E. Smith, a representative of the Washington State Board of Alcohol Regulators.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than put forward some suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent to focus on,” he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and will put the state into a state of uncertainty for a whole year, when the state licensing system does not yet exist, and the right to own marijuana is already legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order to "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on the sale of it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses within cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently established marijuana legalization research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his subordinates that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer hold persons over the age of 21 accountable for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would stop accusing people of these violations "from now on".
Police chief Oates said the police would monitor the city's compliance with the rules governing medical marijuana growers and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
The Weld County Prosecutor in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is taking a more rigorous approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor's office would continue to prosecute possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 people are charged with possession of two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many are also charged with other violations.
"It is the duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer holds adults accountable for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger backed the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in the already opened cases related to the possession of marijuana.
“I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes is our direct duty,” he says.
While 55% of Colorado residents voted in favour of the decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different parts of the state has exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state's experiment with marijuana.
“Country prosecutors have a cultural barrier to this,” explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing marijuana convicts and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve been chasing people for so long that they can’t really accept that it’s not a crime anymore,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana in the same way as alcohol, are destined to become an experimental field nationwide to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope that the Justice Department will concede on this issue.
Despite several resonant arrests of drug traffickers and medical marijuana users, the federal government has in most cases given a benevolence to the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Anti-drug agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser to the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which would not have been able to open sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position to give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
The city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I got out of Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at Worcester College, Oxford, in the late 1980s, I packed my suitcases and left, which resulted in the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink from the sloppy cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically bullied and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I studied in a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this illustrious cradle of enlightenment it seemed true barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You might ask, why do you think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, adhering to the center-right views, is subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Corpus Christi College’s student club in Cambridge say they are “often actively isolated, personally assaulted, and made to feel unwelcome guests” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recent BBC 2 documentary about politics in the student environment, Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right, in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides in a rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver hoodie.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made “scapegoats due to higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the University of Nottingham Association of Conservatives, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that “the university environment is increasing a disorientation towards the left.
“People who don’t even know us think we’re the brazen and impunity-ridden children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the history faculty of Corpus Christi, in which the request for increased protection was filed, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, says that the attitude of members of the student club to right-wingers has deteriorated significantly.
“This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and the normal life of club members,” she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish with hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in the budget allocation for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman week, when students got to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that was waiting for me.
I did not know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but also took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues — the miners’ strike, privatization, and the government’s refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government in South Africa — penetrated the wooden walls of the audience.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was difficult for me, I was stunned.
Harry Pitt was a very gall-like man with a cake-like face.
“The Thatchers don’t teach French in principle, or they just don’t have enough brains?” he asked.
The other students sneered.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in your spare time, unless you are, of course, very busy spinning around in society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting at lunch alone; then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year English-language student who introduced himself as a member of the University’s Association of Conservatives.
“I know who you are,” he said politely.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathizing with conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be harder for you.
Most first-year Conservatives pretend to be Labour.”
Later, at a local pub, I tried cowardly hypocrisy.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman from the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who studied at Eton himself, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"They're kicking each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the criminal prosecution was abolished in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour leader and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because of his membership in the Conservative Party, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettyness, and commitment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends of the capital.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties there were adopted any political views.
“But it’s the best university in the world,” he complained.
- They can't do that, except in the city of slumbering spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably.”
His wet eyes were blurred.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college."
I was exhausted by my constant trips to London and my emotional defenses weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher took me seriously as an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
In my heart of shame, I confessed that my parents had brainwashed me and called them “old fools.”
The respite was short.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a weasel and a rag.
But at eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The sad thing is that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and free-thinking.
“Valentino prefers elegance to fame.”
About the exhibition “Valentino: Master of Sewing”, which opened this week in London, ABC is talking with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: Master of Sewing, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il Signore" Garavani, but it could not be written without his eminent clients.
Valentino has always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, abounds in personal letters and photographs signed by the most aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a modest tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international “elite”.
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
“They don’t at least put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet, like some great pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornewitz.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an outstanding host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains Heini’s ex-wife Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentinian model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after the fashion show in the square of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its furnishings, in food, in music.
“Valentino made each guest feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model” whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Paris Fashion Week.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Pedigree Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of falling in love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was turned into a glamorous catwalk of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must defile the catwalk, contemplating the "viewers" of dreams that sparkle with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her Sweatshirt.
In this audience of models shine names such as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - like the first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember him beautifully.
These were trousers, shirt, "vest" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they “fit” to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also can not forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to put on one of his evening toilets.
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for the holiday at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with frills, a "corsage" in fold and a strapless neckline.
“It was a dream that came true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum care... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories accompanying him."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seams) to make this outfit of ivory silk with pearl inlay, twelve kinds of different lace and a plume of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from the upper world".
Intoxicated for many years by the "lifestyle" of the elite, Valentino is now his own best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalier (a badge of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavalier, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honour, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance,” Dr. Arenberg recalls.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a dinner party at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
“He was flawless, time doesn’t exist for him.”
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living mining sulfur in the Kawah-Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when in contact with air.
Having broken off huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, rolls the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up a steep rocky road.
Up to the summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters high, is only 250 meters, but exhausted loaders need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, with difficulty maintaining balance and carefully tapping the road, so as not to fall and fall from the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who broke down from the rocks of Kawah-Ijen a few years ago.
Kawah-Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they mine
Once on top, they pave their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales, which the mining company placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is the PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to petrochemical industries, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for making matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“Since carrying 70 kilograms is the norm, we earn about 46,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.8) for each walk,” explains Anto, who usually carries three daily carryovers.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would earn in the field.
“The daily payment to the miners is very high by local standards, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for collecting coffee and the average monthly earnings are equal to two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the loader, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason that in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are Hindus", and she took it to Java.
Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes tear because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes tear because of the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or porter at a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
For a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the night, because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers are dragging baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulfur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to bearers who work on their own account and with such disadvantages.
In fact, they don’t even get a portion of the 30,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5) photography fee, which, along with an entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2), guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its mules.
“It’s a job for cattle, not people,” says Badrosin, a rooty stretcher who has spent 42 years on Kawah Ejen for three decades since he left college.
Ability to lift up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate work “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because a volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains of their severe diseases ... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, which are more severe than the pain in the knees and shoulders.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the bushes.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unajnik says, opening his mouth wide, missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works as a sulfur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and housing and education prices for the lack of children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am the husband of a patriot, you are my wife of a patriot, we will fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mint commercial, but despite this — or perhaps because of this — this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like “Let’s put the bao (bride) in the oven” to laugh at Singapore’s birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their “national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction of our own kind, so we felt that this was the topic that we should touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, to launch perfumes with pheromones or organize fast-dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who doesn’t take this so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the policy office for married couples and families of the National Population Office, said the reason for this is “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond marriage and family building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in lower birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to sharply increase immigration to counter population decline, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is a flourishing of barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party scored its worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in birth rates has some impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small homes.
For example, this is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has moved to control the number of small apartments known as “shoe boxes” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46-square-meter apartments sell very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a vacant lifestyle and deprive developers who want to build a large family home of incentive.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” are selling much faster than the more spacious ones.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments buy up for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income increases.
However, he admits that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously put in the way if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Excessively over-stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems they won’t have much effect.
“People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and because of this, many people postpone it,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how hard the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the Singaporeans have the final say in terms of childbearing.
Personal in offline - personal in online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is a property of private or "the sphere of personal life, which have the right to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when discussing situations on the Internet that he probably would not have shared outside the Internet?
ElPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys aged 10 to 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “a password and a username,” when they applied it to social media.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who is behaving stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends in a quick way,” he said.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from an unfamiliar person.
I wouldn't be dealing with someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one rubbed his trust in him and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If they put pressure or demand on me, I’ll just delete them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Only included privacy."
It then explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I didn’t like the person or if I wanted to.
“Although I know it’s cybermobbing,” he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and education and learning specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
“The Internet appeared as a tool for finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she said.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and youth, who were born in the age of technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning,” she says.
He explains that the topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published, or spoken, at an age when maturity is not enough.”
“Also, they should be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or, would you like to have a photo of you published like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask for other people’s permission to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to behave online the same way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, just as they should be on social media,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,” he says.
According to Gaurdiya, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson “do not talk to strangers”.
UNASUR summit ends without promulgation of the Lima Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe had repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the front page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government ' s website at some point.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Umala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without a sound was broadcast in the press room with the message “closed session, sound prohibited”.
Few of the information circulated among the reporters was provided by the press-secretaries of some UNASUR Governments present at the meeting, but not of Peruvian origin.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this is a statement of Umala, and not an official document, which ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite the press insisting, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not circulated.
On the official website of ASPA, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but kept information to a minimum.
The summit also culminated in a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, have gathered at a regional meeting and have ratified that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins Monday's hearing of statements by both sides in The Hague, as part of the indictment Lima has brought against Santiago.
“We will abide by and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court,” Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, and greeted Umalu with a handshake against the backdrop of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia protested this week against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact, according to which it recognized submission to the verdicts of that international court after the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose UNASUR membership has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and the directions of action for 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the amount of the proposed investment amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residency agreements”.
He said action was being taken to improve “cooperation in combating citizens’ insecurity and against organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, affordable Internet access in all corners of South America, and taking into account the risks of natural disasters in an aggregate and effective manner.”
As Europe is in crisis, “economic unification (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... bringing our countries together and creating new economic schemes,” he said.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five relate to Peru and are limited to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a greater link with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before taking part in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico City on Saturday to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of an international court verdict challenged by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaragua Pact will require discussion with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance for the adoption of the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter is suspended.
Peru holds a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.”
Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru’s state television that Europeans “killed each other during World War II” and in other clashes, “but now they are practically one homeland.”
He defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which was endorsed by the UNASUR member countries.
“We need to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to take us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give lectures never assume any obligations, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at one time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be observed."
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come to his territory for questioning over an alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law alone considers it possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration in Assange’s physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What is really there is a danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to being confined in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity that will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, is conducting a number of trials in various European courts,” he said.
“If the UK provides a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will be over.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done on other occasions, interrogates Senor Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate “mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt villains-politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, “neither bankers, nor bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador,” and added that, having been re-elected, “will deepen the revolution in order to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also backed the decision to keep Paraguay's veto at UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also found the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate maritime borders with Nicaragua now "fully justified" following a ruling by the Hague International Court of Justice in favour of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not being respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to work them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the dispute over maritime borders, which is being held in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it is right for Latin America to apply to international bodies if the two countries commit to make a decision, no matter how difficult it is."
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in Ecuador’s upcoming presidential election to run for a third term in a row, he indicated that he considered the possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult”.
Correa assured that if he loses in the February 2013 elections, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to acknowledge this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, that would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he went for the treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean that President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s health will deteriorate,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS test had given a positive result.
"I feel like I've been deafened," he recalls that difficult moment, despite all the doctor's clockwork.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts came true - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients of the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90's it would be difficult to believe - too few treatment options existed then, too little knew about the disease, too biased towards patients.
Even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, having AIDS was a sentence at the time.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without deteriorating the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their disease, still many people come when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV department of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the beginning of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 200 years and CDs with a number of 50 years.
Simply put, the above means that anyone diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been registered by May this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still fatalities?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, that's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the past 12 years, we have had no shortage of medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they are not aware of their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all people who ask for it.”
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned for inspection to a private laboratory, prompted only by the fact that it was done by his friend and, despite his young age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from sarcoma.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'm better off screwing three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, said in a statement to inspire fear for those who are now, in the context of the World AIDS Day.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and the average citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who tackled the HIV-related problem.
The biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a popular question, with outrage and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and health workers, which teenagers do not want to hear, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not just behind the counters, and that hundreds of them be in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
This is not an encouragement to promiscuity.
It’s not about paying for a beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez said when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV.
92% of infections relate to the sexual pathway, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it per registered case.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that nullifies the Vitro Group’s debt restructuring achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
Procedures in support of the survival of firms that are allowed by Mexican laws do not seem to be valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the June 15 decision by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves defenseless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to a leading glass producer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, proving three discrepancies.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceedings concern a competitive proceeding under consideration in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without intercompany voting, recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt proceedings that the Vitro subsidiaries had before their parent company, the majority needed to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose interfirm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of the branches, Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that has overtaken the United States by striking the country.
So far, the firm of the Gonzalez Sada family will appeal the decision to the court of appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenary, that is, five judges, since only three have voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be made, which will require a review of the process by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worse, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae ("court friend"), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it is exempting itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambola from two sides: they beat in Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
Given the months-long complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Union Aviation Pilots Association has already found a bottleneck.
An instance headed by Carlos Diaz Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic regarding the operation performed by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 of IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be used to purchase shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Meeting this weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the common civil society approved the creation of a broad front to confront the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a gigantic sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces that leveled off part of the protected territories and pose serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the government’s rejection of the Senate’s request to explain under what conditions and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA’s English abbreviation, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already gone to the archives.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of viewing it as violating freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Khetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Avid basketball traveler Hector "Khetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball histories as Hector "Heathin" Reyes.
And before a brain hemorrhage chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small-scale player, a Major League basketball player, a commissioner and head of the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys, and president of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, CEO of the National Team, and president of the federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during Primera Hora’s visit to his home in Bayamon, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife, for over 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected during his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These were the best years I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or executive.
There were many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey made his debut at BSN.
From that moment on, Kuko Ortiz became the head, who was a great administrator,” Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was on his way here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Would you?"
And that was the start of Minsey, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey had brought the championship to Bayamo, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements of Minsey in the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we got fourth place and it had to be bronze, if not for the Canadian referee who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one who won from the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and broke up the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minsey, Gauss, Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortis), but also the young (Javier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Chichote' Morales, who was unable to participate in the 90s due to a wheel injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualification tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-playing players like 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Aliseo and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily suspended for disorder in the Pan-American Championship of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculin has.
And this is without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good youngster, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in BSN there were up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's superfluous.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the Dallas television series, in which he portrayed a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night of complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
“Larry is back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the iconic role he loved the most,” his family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived a full life,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television for his role as a decent type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he plays Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive jinn girl played by Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the protagonist of two rarely aired comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who Shoots J.R.?", designed to create hype around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars, which were risked in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most watched entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finale, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be treated.
“I know what should be on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages of New York City in the early 1950s and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t include anything that I thought was capable of inflicting pain on anyone or influencing them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and after,” he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that explores “The End of the World” begins
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Charme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people grabbed as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what he was expecting in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call “long-armageddon,” and the growing conflict that will drag Israel into, a place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Sharme told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we only have 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor who offers courses on the topic of “the end of the world” in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, adjunct professor Barry Wacker is reading a course on “Media, Culture, and the End of the World.”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions are proposed.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell students what is possible, probably plausible and impossible,” Wacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the “imminent destruction,” students must study, prepare projects, and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night that the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“Places are over in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-intermediate students, which enrolled 35 students.
We received emails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I love watching what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology from Huddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Weckesa, a 25-year-old student in the psychology and nursing department, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a course that teaches that,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed — not to mention the professor — said they believed in the end of the world date of December 21.
“Our first project affected the prophecy of the Maya, and in some ways we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old last-year student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, where people react to the changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places, people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any course about the “end of the world” there.
“Philippines are not taking part at the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an order from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Stall noted that many days of the last trial had been talked about for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are very careful about this date.
Some said they were going to the "end of the world" party.
“Maybe I’ll call one of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
