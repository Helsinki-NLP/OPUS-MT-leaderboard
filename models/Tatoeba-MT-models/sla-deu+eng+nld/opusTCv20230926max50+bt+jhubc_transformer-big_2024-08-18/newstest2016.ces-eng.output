In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their home.
Lamb vowed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at the house, and that contacts on the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter said.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot the popular Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fateful call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details, published by state investigators and students and employees who knew him, together created the image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in a thank-you to the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with 17 other faculty members, and many students attended classes at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave, saying he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment of staff meant that a doctorate, for which Lamb worked hard, would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seems to have been troubled."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the state border into Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot in the yard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State Coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her guitar for several years.
He was a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls were softened as soon as he appeared,” said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"It was a total breakdown," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were best friends.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O’Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat that Lamb finished on guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We were chatting and recording each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a first-year seminar and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended a commemoration event with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this reportage.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that police now claim Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says they won’t hire as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but a toy and product manufacturer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will be recruiting employees between October and December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily recruit employees to help with stores and sales, for sending and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana was going to be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The film is starting and I’m getting to know something that could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s truly the best travel document ever filmed for me.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that there is “no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the margins of a ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unresolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching Iran’s nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 Electoral Numbers That Show Donald Trump in Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like a joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But no matter how many Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the polls, they are failing (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead by a two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously wonder what that means for the real estate tycoon’s nomination chances.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end none of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeba Bush’s Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth are realizing Trump’s will to endure and are starting to put their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate tycoon is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump’s approval rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of the real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "indignant" about his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enthusiastic” against the 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disturbed” if Jeb Bush’s favorite became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bloating and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to think that a real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to an ABC News/Washington Post Monday vote.
The same number holds in the Iowa state senatorial club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think they don’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their school hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s a change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time last year, 4 out of 10 Republicans had chosen Rick Perry as their nominee, against 28 percent for a possible Mitt Romney nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct duel between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over the trader by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have already made their point.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump-backed voters say they will not change their mind.
Obviously, a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46% say they keep the back door open for a change between candidates.
Yet Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has still been held as the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump’s bloating will distract key Hispanic voters from the Republican party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post opinion poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump appears to remain as well.
Frustration from the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving roughly half the voter support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are “dissatisfied” and 21 percent are “hell angry.”
The House has supported a larger share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in the first reading supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenues from the surface extraction of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised MPs that thanks to this they would receive additional money from both the state treasury and municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a greater part of the revenue from fees from the surface mining of brown coal from the mining company.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the previous 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the way in which the compensation for the minerals that companies extract is calculated.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets are expected to have a neutral impact, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns from the fees and the state budget 150 million crowns.
About 200 million crowns went to the municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from the extraction of brown coal.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining areas with permitted mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments should continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told lawmakers that municipalities would earn CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government regulation.
The reimbursement shall be calculated as a result of the quantity of the mined mineral and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by government regulation may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be applied in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects from the mining fees will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would damage the villages affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Dawn) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MP Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned of rising unemployment in Mostecko.
Kadner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for revision.
The reasoning says that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are negotiated for more than 90 percent of the long-term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not experience price increases.
“On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,” the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in fees in terms of employment is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the novel by Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is mined beyond limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> will lead the Czechs as the first, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the table at the Davis Cup draw in India on Thursday, and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til plans to distribute the load over the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, so there are tough matches expected, which can last up to five hundred.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And according to how it will look, he said during today's training of Czech selection in the center of Raja Kum<0xC3><0xA1>r Khanna.
With the team’s number one and the world’s forty, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> is counting on Friday and Sunday singles.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek are probably in the second place.
I want almost everyone to be involved.
It's slow in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech squad should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It’s just a question of who will stand next to an experienced doubles player, who has an 18:4 score in the Davis Cup.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are still options with Rosol or Adam Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"I really don't know who or what it's going to look like," he said.
It depends on the evolution of the two.
The variant may be Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek, with Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> surprised in the 1st round by winning the doubles over the Australians.
"He's decent," he said back.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I would like to play the same performance I showed there from the second set.
"I like the experience and would like to bring a point," Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek said.
The home team will put Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the players of the third and fourth hundredth rankings.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are challengers and ours have experience with the ATP Tour, but many times we have already seen that the Davis Cup rankings do not decide.
"The current form, the weather, decides," he said.
Friday's opening singles will start at 6:30 CEST and may be extended due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it's supposed to rain and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it, and it's got about two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be done under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn’s PMQ debut is highly anticipated.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his Prime Minister's Questions debut later, and will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he demanded "less theater and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand in silence while singing the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the front pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said he would “stand in respectful silence” and acknowledge “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.”
But Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "no matter" what his belief was that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences at work are also "shrinking" after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party had "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers’ Party to be confronted by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "immediate responses" and tooth trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also gave up the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time because he was told that he was still discussing the matter with House spokesman John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House, and their position among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photoshoot in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I Was Photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and earn money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra rises while wage growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following data and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven higher by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB’s earnings, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it looked as if estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a bid approximation from its rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Stocks in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest drop in the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its firm rating to "sales."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in mid-year earnings before taxes <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague flat marshmallow rejoice.
Controversial building got a stop.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the construction, which is to be created in the vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Monastery in the center of Prague, and a petition was created.
In the decision, the magistrate stated that there had been a violation of the construction law, because not all the requirements of the territorial decision had been complied with.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain certain requirements, for example, the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and clearly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the construction," the decision reads.
The magistrate also considers it illegal that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation under consideration, which has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be created on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
From the file material it follows, however, that the owner of the land only showed consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the placement of the building on its land, writes the Department of the Building Code.
According to Francesco Augusto Razette of the investment firm, the building code department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the opening of the review has already expired.
Either way, this is a scandalous process.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razette said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow because of the supposedly proposed color of the facade, provokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are bothered that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fr<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the project was changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which included a glazed facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and revoked the permission of Prague's conservationists in 2010.
The new project of the company Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NP<0xC3><0x9A> and the magistrate conservationists, and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the reproaches of opponents, saying that he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project the nickname of pink-white candy.
Czech politicians brought in migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg travelled to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
Along the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into their car, who were said to have been driven about a half-kilometre away.
It was not criminal in Hungary at the time, he told the newspaper.
We knew that the guardians of the law did not punish such actions.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in prison.
Police said they behaved correctly, but communication was tight because they could not speak English very well.
The prison, however, was trite.
For example, in our cell measuring about three times four meters, there were 15 refugees from Syria.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg said.
What can no longer be entertained?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
The President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> will answer questions from readers on Friday 18.9.
You can ask her about amendments to the law on executions in force from September 1, 2015 and other matters related to executions, or executives.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s onslaught in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening ties with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events like the Adelaide Show.
IGA merchants and suppliers are joining brands such as the Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investor-strategic day.
South and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA’s trade moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, which took over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in southern Australia and 30 in the west over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash’s solid price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said Melbourne’s business lunches could “highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of the change in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have moved into counter-attacks and are investing more than $150 million a year to match counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from privateers.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says price matching and re-equipment programs are on the decline and hopes to return to core profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a collateral loss in a recent row around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks", attracted unwelcome attention due to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated from the referee twice, Harrison then said, "Wawrinka should have stretched one to Kyrgios and I should have stretched it to him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after convulsions hampered his ability to beat Richard Gasquet at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis defended Healy steadfastly.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes against Sam Groth for a second-round spot behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"I was thinking quite intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a convulsion in the US, but he is not the first player to extinguish anger on his rocket because of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But he really controlled himself very well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a bit harshly.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits perfectly into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains very hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important match starting on Friday, saying the "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but he supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term statist.
“First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around it,” says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and others point out, in the eyes of the public he is growing rapidly, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the sun when he will be able to think about it is also for the team, in my opinion.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border as hundreds of migrants piled up in the country, and Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown time on the strips of land between two states are those who flee violence in their home countries, build tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together call "Open the borders!" and reproach the police.
Some people refuse food and water.
The Serbian foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
Over the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries,” says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Riots at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at its ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke in hopes of reaching a possible agreement next month or the end of the year that EU nations would take in more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU summit on Tuesday to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday’s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities greater authority to resolve the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up court cases of asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country once the fence on the Serbian border is now complete.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are pursuing a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalise the violation of a four-meter fence that the government has allowed to be erected on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we are quite clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the country.
They penetrated through damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly repaired the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed-wire tow truck.
At the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos arose, as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing, and pressure from people arose.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s runoff before Bernie Sanders cut by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton is now backed by 47% of Democratic primary voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of major competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say there are clear decisions they will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and is easing, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men decreased significantly, and Sanders lost only 5 points on her.
Clinton’s advantage with democratic voters under 50 has vanished and they are now on par with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a strong lead, thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders only loses 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her for being a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it’s time to be a woman president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a great opportunity to choose and agree on the problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential bid, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to lead – a third think he shouldn’t.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice to nominate the party, Biden was the most common choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be electable is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of election.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some of the key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of the three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think so.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
As far as all these measures are concerned, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of it hasn’t affected her at all.
But among the American public, it’s a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue was revealed.
Most Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall view of the Clintons, while 36 percent say their view of the Clintons has deteriorated.
It’s mainly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and credible among her party’s voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and credible, down eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also don’t see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump both have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush were the best.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn’t think of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends with Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, while the others are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% in the latest CBS poll conducted ahead of the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographics, and knocks Trump out among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is back together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on edge from a 10% support drop to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump’s 32% support.
The latest poll from the ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s upward trend, Trump decided to shoot a retired neurosurgeon blindly, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said during a campaign in Iowa last Saturday.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-year Baruch College Student
Nearly two years after a student died during an overburdening fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Dengo during the inauguration ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital late, contributing to his death, police said.
Police said he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before being taken to hospital, police said.
However, they took the time to change Deng’s dress, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the nationwide president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, members began to hide their equipment and essentially preferred the well-being of the brotherhood over the life of Michael Deng,” Wagner said in a statement.
He was unable to recover and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by overburdening in fraternities, and at least one student dies each year from overburdening since the 1970s,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement.
The fraternity and its members must take responsibility, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assault by overburdening and criminal association.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity and the national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
Rates will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy in particular, the history of a small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, but not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hikes will begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss about speeding up can be exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more common but still low rates to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month or so, the expected rate hikes can make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for stock to be stopped again after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years has often been the most - about 14 percent - heading for a relatively flat rate hike in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main stock strategist at Nuset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate cycle and returns are starting to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but raising rates often helps it.
Currently, the Fed faces some conditions that did not yet exist and which could speed up the recession.
The most notable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, annual nominal GDP growth was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against this complex economic backdrop could be risky, and the question "whether this time is different" could arise, Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the upward cycles so far have been in a super leverage cycle with GDP covering the peaks of the onset of a recession very quickly after the onset of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months, and we are still continuing.
Fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects an increase in rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes course of policy.
For bonds, returns appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the up/down cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that raising rates will bring yields between long- and short-dated bonds closer together, equalizing the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although “we’re still careful about tightening the yield,” said Kathy Jones, a tight-knit fixed-income analyst at Schwab in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusted to the expectations of the Fed’s policies.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a more stringent monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased – all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win after the interest rate rises and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse, as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt will also be higher.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to be surpassed within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheets in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock-based games, consumers also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticizes the station for “stupidity”
He believes that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they’re just cheating on the British
Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked Voice and says neither is he an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is “changing” to Classic FM, a leading MP claims, and is accumulating fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove they are doing something that commercial broadcasts don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public service radio station appears to be “stupid” and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word 'stupid' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are two examples that strike me, when you’re actually just imitating what we already have on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually at the cutting edge.
“I also think that Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production that came under fire due to treading on the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport, and they got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was produced "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when he launches a fun series next time.
However, he declined to rule out ordering more future The Voice series or spending taxpayers’ fees money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be a reason to slow down spending
Virtual shopping has been on the rise for more than a decade and has made many of Britain’s main streets a ghost town.
However, experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a 7 percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a 7 percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth level of the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always rationalized over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on a sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to fade away.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average shopper turned to their computers to arrange purchases and toppled several retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers contract again, can deter customers from further purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims Buried Victims of Crane Crash in Mecca and Bin Laden Family Sanctioned
The bodies of the 29 dead were transported through the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane fall at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims down the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose their way and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen made his final journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned a construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people killed in the collapse of a crane at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will take place, and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the crane's shoulder up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disk agency did not report this detail, but said that the heads of the company were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman pledged to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims coverge before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement on the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not provided for comment.
The royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi-ruling family for decades and are running major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade, whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that must be completed at least once in their lives by every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) will be donated to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q CEO Says Eastern European Traders Working for Cheap Already Trending
Brits are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Edited by Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British reportedly put down hammers and brushes and hand them over to busy, trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY work at their home, according to the company’s head for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the chain for domestic needs, argues that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make the better half.
Currently, most of the workers are male.
She said there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says: "Most men work in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of purchase decisions.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the UK FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Laura says: “It was a conscious decision – diversity is an important topic here.
So it was not difficult to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher announced a decline in both mid-year profits and sales after the group took on the cost of closing deals.

The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of the straight stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice-President of TOP 09, who stressed the principle of merit.
Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura, the Chairman of the ODS Members, noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better if it were in standard valorisation, because it would reflect on the next years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to deal with this," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksov<0xC3><0xA1> (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which next year was to be valued beyond the law.
Marx defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which, according to her, is not pink.
Higher valuations next year would have a budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorization has decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Op<0xC3><0xA1>lka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing veto would complicate the payment in December and possibly make it impossible, he said.
Therefore, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP Roman Sklen<0xC3><0xA1>k proposed to shorten the deadline for discussion of the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, and the right blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money comes mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the coming year, pensions are expected to increase by an average of about a hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be received by people who will be entitled to a pension or a part of it in December.
It can also be obtained by those who have lost their pension entitlement before its payment in December.
However, they would have to apply for the supplement in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valued regularly by January, by price increases and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross salary, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
Last year, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions, which was about five billion more in the year-on-year, according to the state's final account.
Spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension last year increased by 104 to CZK 10,714, according to the data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided for the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin left his plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to the Russian media, the billionaire’s Senate seat was almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was supposed to represent the West Russian Kaliningrad region, whose Governor Nikolai Tsukanov, as a candidate of the United Russia government party, defended his post in Sunday's elections.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from the three candidates whose names he announces before the governor's election.
After the election, he will elect a senator from the three candidates.
The complication for Yakunin was that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin, however, found an exception for Yakunin, saying that he was an extraordinary and empowered ambassador who was not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The final drop in the hero's intention is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urov<0xC3><0xA1> decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1> are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the current one, Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k told the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would belong to Bartosz, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery from a serious illness, surprised him.
We had a deal three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was probably a hooked athlete.
Before filming the next scene, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks, and even walked uphill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director noted.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women take a tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They'll pour him some food, but they'll close the door right away so he won't accidentally think of playing a tiger outside the rabbit house.
And that’s what we’re trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and means it well.
But at the same time, she is an usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, said Baigar.
The film parallels the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - T<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmov<0xC3><0xA1> and Pavla Beretov<0xC3><0xA1> - and sons-in-law Erik and Pep<0xC3><0xAD>k - Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Havelka and Jakub Koh<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has pledged to provide an additional $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flow to Europe.
Google.org announced this on Tuesday, which is a charity branch of the Internet company.
Azerbaijan has canceled part of Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ko’s visit for criticizing human rights abuses.
Czech MEP for the ANO movement Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka postponed Thursday's planned trip to Baku because Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit today.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, this is justified by the EP resolution of last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka was a co-author.
By the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The resolution condemns “unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan”.
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent verdict of the Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismail, who advocated uncovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the possibility of building an air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out that a Russian air base in Syria would be established in the future.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has used as a service and logistics center.
According to the Russian press, since the beginning of August, the supply of Russian weapons and military supplies to Syria has increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, US commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria, the third phone call in ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to interpret concerns about the gathering of Russian arsenals near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Moscow’s support for Assad was a “lost bet.”
He said Russia’s policy objectives in Syria are rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has turned Syria into a satellite.
This could mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal, but which one, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to a report by The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and the Russian president could meet during a UN meeting.
The White House’s advisers, however, have differed.
TASS quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin has not yet met with Obama on his New York program.
Sesame oil is applied during the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from cold seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example, gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common causes of death of Czechs for several years.
Biliary inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss the sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of foods and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties three times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder mainly concern overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should watch out for goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use toasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all its active ingredients, Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>eck<0xC3><0xBD>, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in the Sokolov region, which produces bio virgin oils pressed cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses only unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press will be able to squeeze out eight kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for an extra virgin designation.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for heart and blood vessel diseases.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Research by Jarmila Hamerska, who led Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 °C it begins to overburn.
It is better to use it, for example, for dressing salads and it is especially useful in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high content of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which, of all fatty acids, reduce cholesterol levels the most.
In case of heart problems, you should be careful about the amount of total fat and calories you receive.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of foods, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than the so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially processed products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator will prolong the shelf life.
Old oil is known to people mainly by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, the defect is not cloudy at the bottom.
It is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Hemp seeds are among the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body and must be taken from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that in the company Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling.
It sells 500 liters per year.
People often take one tablespoon fasting in the morning.
Hemp oil is not in any taste, but it will perfectly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the beauty company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecuers are Americans.
There are 1.4 grills per household.
Around the world, various barbecue competitions are held, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives did not grill.
The vast majority of them also grill several times a year.
In order for the barbecue to be successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time retains health benefits when grilling?
In general, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then loses the body the beneficial substances that we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When meat is said, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in the Sokolov region are immediately reminded of grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen is characterized by the unique property of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils retains health benefits, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help increase our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when tasting salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
So when grilling, you can use it in two ways, when marinating and grilling itself.
Marinating meat and fish will preserve their juiciness.
When preparing a marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, add apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
The spice in turn adds flavor to the meat and preserves the oil and delivers the right skewer, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
So, marinated meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies especially to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grating with oil to prevent the food from burning.
Preparation of attachments is also an essential part of grilling.
For grilled meat and fish, almost anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 pc of peach • 1 bunch of rucola • 1 cup of chopped cucumbers • 1 cup of a mixture of lettuce leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add chopped rucola, chopped cucumbers, and peach into large cubes in a salad bowl.
To taste, salt and pepper, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drip a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not only about the drugs, but also about the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, this is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, social legal advice, recommendations for housing, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, the passiveness of the patients frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is proved that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, for example, a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to various myths, for example that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why the Give a Chance website (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, there is a saying that the sooner the disease begins to heal, the more likely a doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater is the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains Dr. Eva Medov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or imbalance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depending on the specific difficulties of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Köv<0xC3><0xA1>ri, Head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
Although people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation can not stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in case of multiple sclerosis.
Another benefit of regular exercise is the fact that the patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"The endorphins are also released during the exercise and the person feels well after it," says PhDr. Kamila <0xC5><0x98>asov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Faculty Hospital of Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovské Vinohrady.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were so-called "saved", today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, Head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is to ensure that a person can remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including employment.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with occupational therapists so that each person receives a compensatory aid tailor-made for him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shaken by it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to a heavy burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we have to follow someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they can finally come to the conclusion that even with a disability it is possible to live a full-fledged life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinov<0xC3><0xA1> - Schubertov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbuses would not fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that no one can make and process.
Nevertheless, in addition to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for forming composites, one can come across something as ordinary as apricot kilns.
In the drum, which resembles a sugar wool pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are ground in the pile of furnaces.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of the latecoere Czech Republic aircraft door manufacturer.
At the premises in Prague’s Let<0xC5><0x88>any, the former Letov produces complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply the doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is being assembled in Prague, also includes passengers in the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world’s largest transport aircraft, the Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the momentary keys are adjusted twice a year by the company.
If the yellow sticker does not have a check record, they should explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who drive regularly to see if the doors are made according to the agreed rules, in the Prague plant.
Human senses, however, have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to the A320.
The rivets must be cracked by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even from the sound of the hammer falling, they can tell if the rivet is already correctly broken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The nit can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the inspection, a trained touch comes to the fore.
When the controller swipes a string of rivets with his finger, he knows if there is any out-of-tolerance.
Then he takes the exact deflection meter in his hand.
Letov lived before 1989 the program of the training military aircraft L-39.
In 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
At that time, it teamed up with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
Conversations with Boeing were not so happy.
“We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable deliveries,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain closed if Letov did not take the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
I talked about our cooperation with Airbus.
Negotiations with the French began the next day, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the assembly of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not have gotten to these big jobs on our own.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
The partners want guarantees of deliveries for twenty or thirty years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have made any doors to aircraft.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated inspections, it costs millions of crowns to maintain them according to Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to train our employees, equip the equipment and certify the whole process again, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The company is now finalizing a process for zinc and nickel plating to replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we show them the production.
They'll also check our lab.
They will test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, which shows Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> the way customers control them.
The reward is the Prague company’s long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today stands and falls the production of embraers.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
To replace the Czech Latecoere is either impossible for a Brazilian or European manufacturer, or very difficult.
However, this does not mean that you can say any price for the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It tells you how much one door will cost ten, fifty, a hundred pieces made.
The price per piece continues to fall to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this price pattern.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Half of the hall, where electric cabinets for the military aircraft Airbus A400 M are assembled, is empty so far.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic riveting and door assembly line for the A320 Neo is being built.
The riveting will be accelerated and refined.
"This is the trend that is moving away from the assembly in aviation," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The future line is secure.
Airbus has ordered 3,278 A320s so far.
Just a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete installation of the doors for the upper deck of the A380.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, before that, the company must pass qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic devices in the doors of the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on the further development of production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says proudly.
Latecoere, however, is on the verge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the Letov area, where he is based, there is no other place.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now there are 800 of them, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing keep up the pace of ordering hundreds of new aircraft every year, they don’t have to worry about their jobs.
Despite having contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, they exchanged some of their loans for shares.
The creditors gained a share of 37.4 percent in the company by raising capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed to existing shareholders for new shares for 222.9 million euros.
In total, it raised the share capital by 280 million euros.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
The average contract growth is expected to be 4% per year until 2017.
In the order book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on drips.
The Czech race in Prague’s Let<0xC5><0x88>any is important for groups.
16 percent contribute to the group's revenues.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members of Parliament supported a larger share of the state's coal taxes.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets are expected to have a neutral impact, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns from the fees and the state budget 150 million crowns.
About 200 million crowns went to the municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from the extraction of brown coal.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining areas with permitted mining to a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments should continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told lawmakers that municipalities would earn CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government regulation.
The reimbursement shall be calculated as a result of the quantity of the mined mineral and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by government regulation may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be applied in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects from the mining fees will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised today by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would damage the villages affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Dawn) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MP Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned of rising unemployment in Mostecko.
Kadner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for revision.
The reasoning says that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are negotiated for more than 90 percent of the long-term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not experience price increases.
“On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,” the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in fees in terms of employment is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the novel by Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is mined beyond limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain idle for a while and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been a few years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The U.S. economy was doing fairly well, with a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that same day his colleague - wrote a message claiming he was "sorry" for the first murder and wishing he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called police Monday morning at about 10 a.m.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send a police officer to his house.
He said: “I shot my wife last night” and also mentioned that there was a “cute dog” in the house that “wouldn’t bother anyone” but was upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not present himself.
Lamb also did not explain why there was a shooting in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb saying, “I’m so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving a note, Lamb made a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday’s statement that Lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship between Amy Prentiss and Schmidt, government officials said there was “no evidence” of the “love triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for more than seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
O’Steen and Prentiss’ 19-year-old daughter was “shocked” by the case.
O’Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, according to the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Flash, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She's always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail.
When police caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he shot himself.
According to the curriculum vitae he published on the school’s website, Lamb received a PhD in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001 and lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things are taxing themselves.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left this injury in tears and knocked him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moreno's reckless intervention in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 has a very hard time, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he plays again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was mistaken.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both legs.
A tweet from Shaw’s account said: “Thank you to everyone for their messages, words can’t express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery starts now and I’ll come back even stronger.”
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Philip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It was a very nasty injury.”
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture during a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt his opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I could only see the ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling’s surgery.
Does David Cameron know The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long to learn it almost by heart.
You can't be David Cameron.
When asked by a child schema provider to name his favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, I loved reading it to my kids because there was always an image or message behind it that I hadn’t seen before.”
Well, only after that, in the next paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book according to a 2012 movie lift that added more characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a wall where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the concise content of the book, which records the object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss in 1991.
As if it wasn’t suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads like a summary of the Lorax film, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: “In the town of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by a wall where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win his heart.”
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be unfamiliar with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that local nature is being devastated by the ravenous, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, the shriveled, moustache-like creature who speaks "for a tree."
Most likely, such a relatively unimportant PR task was given to an assistant who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text likely came from Cameron’s supporters’ office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of neglecting England, but still holding
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England has chosen for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat that she suffered last time in the trial series is not very likely.
I wouldn't rule out winning guests, either.
Alastair Cook’s party may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this battering outfit and collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only youth positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali's developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the trial series level, represents an offensive option.
Adam Lyth dropped out of England in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to neglect Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I’ve said this before — players are their best picks.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performances weren’t 100%, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s always been a team player.
The question of how much trial time the batter gets to show himself is a hard nut.
Lyth was given seven caps — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton was given nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and abroad.
The only thing you might be remcatting is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean—although Lyth was in his best form—but this wasted opportunity is already a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming and this is a batter I rate very positively.
He's the x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won 236 at the Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been raised and I have no objections to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't fire, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there’s no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 rehearsals before performing in 2001.
He managed to do it for three centuries and didn't even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, I was intrigued as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a pramica, but there aren’t a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors have opted for youth.
They will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it seems that England has made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batter from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on a white-ball tour and brings both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes got a one-day break, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy stagnates by 2017.
The inconceivable strategy of renegotiating David Cameron to keep Britain in the EU gets into more trouble every day even without electing the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to head the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have had enough of Britain's egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want to do so even if they ate up social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then come home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an untapped Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the too long-running Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to watch them break their legs with the help of the British Selfie, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK — something they themselves don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning intentionally useless SNP-style remarks during the pre-2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from the negotiations."
Europeans know to their own detriment how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the EU is of the press oligarch barons because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, a cunning Euro-opportunist who made his name as Brussels' "EU straight bananas" reporter in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-free thugs, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo-non-overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a rabid gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she won't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, ever since Blair accepted the principle of the repealed EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him a dismissal card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him not to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-accepting the Murdoch Neil Kinnock boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC chair he left on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official stance on Europe is, I’ll say it mildly, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the furious Ukip tendencies and the wild shores of Tory's little Englandism can certainly take it.
That's what Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't dare admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all times" - Benna's phrase - was apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey — remember, it touched me too — the discipline of the news remains important in the age of all-day television broadcasting, and especially in the faith, the frenzy of paranoia and betrayal that social media is.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the support of the Workers’ Party in the referendum campaign as self-evident, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s basic distortions about EU membership – in line with their Bennite besieging economy, an anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic squabbling.
As with his twisting on NATO – Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems useless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by Britain’s “weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even while cutting the costs of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the opening of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize e-review published by Public Health England
A statement by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency released a "measurement" report last month describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the breadth of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet magazine last month attacked an "extraordinarily shaky base" on which PHE was basing its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have disputed claims that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They state that the public could expect PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the discussions were summarized in a research report.
According to McKee and Capewell, one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, the CEO of which allegedly had previously obtained funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health mandate BAT in the Sustainability Report, it states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they said.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industrial funding in the newspaper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at the PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The group’s report “expressly admits,” lacking “hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claim that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a smoking route for children or non-smokers” was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two smokers die from addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses and cost the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC Should End With EastEnders, Says Former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give a right hand" to a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for deploying public service programs likely to be watched by only a handful of people, in difficult broadcasting times over his rivals' biggest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to connect with the BBC for six years working on Channel 4.
“I’m fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s negotiations on the future.
If you keep license fees that I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, at least for programs that others don’t produce or deliver, the creation should be reduced.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and, of course, produced domestically.
Honestly, other channels would have given them the right hand.
I can't understand how these are public broadcasters.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a TV businessman who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for catching up with ratings “because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support.”
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more well-groomed public service programs of the BBC "go to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission of justifying <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of revenue from license fees," "But of course we are doing all these obscure programs that no one is looking at."
They're broadcast at a time when no one's watching.
As for the royalty, Johnson told the commission: “I urge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a big amount, but for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot, I would be surprised if they pay that much because they don’t watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke to the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the BBC’s small production volume had already been classified as educational – it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio – and should take as a model public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to “inform, clarify and entertain.”
On the topic of partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which have only been broadcast on television by a handful, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the tuber moves.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny tubercles change direction when they are affected by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
The researchers said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and is activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation — an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are inserted into the patient’s brain.
The tubercles usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves act in the ion channels of TRP-4, which is found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the tubercles by ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contained TRP-4 ion channels.
When he used ultrasound on the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbells and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical treatments to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements embarrassing the British arms trade.
Watch the video on the anti-weapon market from Amnesty International.
Horrible killer drones!
The shackles on the legs that break the ankles!
Shaking bullets!
And electric stunning batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricature of metaphors leave no one in doubt that this ad at the world’s largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the emergence of posters at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to the DLR from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using a font with London Underground signs with DLR lines becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend to the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective, called Special Patrol Group, has helped distribute across London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen Key, which allegedly "will gain access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists within protest movements and realize that they need to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms trade health of the passengers on the subway.
The video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads — he saw an empty space in the ExCeL calendar — and thought, “Let’s show them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They were playing around with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but “by adding colorful colors and animation, we’ve made it appeal to more people.”
“They’ve done a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the trade fair,” said Tom Davies, Amnesty International’s chief executive.
What we now need is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military to "on the shoulder of the AT4CS RS launcher."
This includes a "uniquely shaped head that delivers amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."

Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
11 years ago, I moved to college as an inattentive nineteen-year-old, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I was bothering — and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can range from slightly on the nerves of the gorging to totally horrifying.
It's tempting to gossip: to tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what's your opinion of Corbyn, and why "you honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to also take a breath - ask and express interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find the people you love and the ones you wouldn't be dealing with even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were releasing fire extinguishers.
Leave people room.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and communal public places, but they’re also rooms where people dress up and dress up their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about starting college while in a relationship
Introverts come to college.
Your room should be a haven, yet many tracks turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One boy in my dorms used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Since you started going to university on top of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and performing with a plate of baked cakes seems a little less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and perhaps everything will end up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and stiffness are likely to disrupt others’ pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk a theft in your tea?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they are furious inside.
If someone steals something from you, it’s annoying and you have my sympathies — but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate who traded her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, you’re also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quiet down a little drum and bass, because it was 3 at night and she had a note in the morning.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then played her own music aloud, locked the door and left for her three-hour note.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same colleges as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and might also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can’t trust your heart – but if your sexy roommate isn’t 100% your future spouse, try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about how to keep them safe by hiding something for them - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in the water bottle, then put them in the freezer – but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a difficult time already during her pregnancy with today’s seven-year-old V<0xC3><0xAD>tek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone in the preparation and upbringing of her offspring.
I dealt with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and I was looking for positives in it.
Uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to bother.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for a long time, Eva remembers her first pregnancy today.
Already then she met on the Internet in the chat of the elder Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eva and V<0xC3><0xAD>tek home from the maternity ward, but he did not get too involved in the role of stepfather.
"He then pulled out of the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in Three.
The motive of the third series of the Czech television series is the search for happiness on the second attempt.
Caring for V<0xC3><0xAD>tek and financial security of the family managed thanks to part-time work and great help from her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not ultimately spoil Vasko's affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around V<0xC3><0xAD>tek’s second birthday and he now understands V<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek as his dad and also calls him that way.
Even though Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood in his 60s according to his words and also devotes himself more to children.
In addition to V<0xC3><0xAD>tek, two-year-old Leont<0xC3><0xBD>nka and finally twins joined them.
"Your family came in kind of naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked much to me in a relationship," she says.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
The twins Ema and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a violation of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess in the blood of a pregnant woman and are manifested especially by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually spontaneously disappears.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vasko's happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emika was placed in an incubator in the intermediary department, where Vaskova’s niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, describing the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for the baby to be born in the maternity hospital did not make Eva happy.
"I was mad at the longing for my husband and children," recalls the difficult moments at the ward of six-and-a-half, a four-time mother.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But this did not happen in the end, and the doctors released Eva and the twins to home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large family can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with an electric double plate and cramped conditions.
The house did not grow bigger, but Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we'll trade for a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive in particular the family comfort and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or shyness of the house.
So far, we have done very well, better than we expected.
Although the mess is harder to hide in a small space, and sometimes we cross the rolling babies, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek's work as an illuminator in the film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
That is why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of sixty, according to his words, the care of the finances of the family and children physically copes, but how long will it be so?
“I realize that, given our age difference, I will be the one to feed this family,” Eva admits.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly an employer.
And when it's the worst, my husband and I can swap for a taxi, jokes a cute blonde.
Apple has a yo-yo effect.
It's all because of the displays.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a firmer chassis, or a touch-sensitive display are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend is that every new iPhone generation is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference to the disadvantage of this novelty was really negligible.
However, this is not the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model, and by 20 grams for the larger one.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair with bending in Apple's pockets was greatly troubled.
The chassis of the novelty is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which also reflected in the weight.
But displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology, thanks to which the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to equip the display with another layer of capacitive sensors.
Thus, the weight of the displays of the new iPhones has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
In the case of a smaller iPhone, from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger iPhone, from 19 to 40 grams.
With the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty thanks to the degreasing bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, it is the heaviest used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is visible at the display.
The 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus weighs 192 grams.
To what extent the new display technology will be practical, it will only manifest itself during use.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Are the flakes of breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglice, archaeologists have managed to find a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
In Layer 23A, which, according to the instruments, dates back to about 30,000 years ago, but scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
On the spot, traces of oat grains were found, which apparently went through the process of producing today so popular flakes.
With it, the grains are first soaked, then dried, stripped of the packaging, the so-called plow, then welded and flattened.
In the cave Paglicci managed to find grains, which were apparently heated or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists have not been able to prove in their publication for PNAS that a complete process of production of flakes is taking place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very noticeable.
We also don’t have any evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and possibly warm enough is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is very interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes were about 20,000 years ahead of agriculture.
New station reports in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the report of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnus<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova, P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>zrak, Fr<0xC3><0xA1>zova, Sprateck<0xC3><0xA1>.
Of course, the trolleybus was a little louder, so the male voice was a little less clear than it was when the stops were reported by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a couple of decades now, so I know the correct names of all these stops by heart, so I don’t need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who don’t know themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, may be confused and may go to the final, where they got by mistake, then claim that the stop they were not at.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better yet, the announcer - should be made again, and this time discolored by the usual traffic noise and engine roar, in which the hooting of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we don't have to listen to the names of the stations Water Herspice, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>rova, or Submerged in the creaking slush, to which I transferred in Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
I guess my old-fashioned hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden during the one day that the stop messenger changed.
I understood the report pretty well that day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the trackman's notes.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest checks were under the party’s government.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't meet your comrade chief, came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher said as I signed up for the arrivals book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going through the districts to revise the small mechanization.
That's not going to happen, because there are checks today.
They're all fucked up. It's horrible.
What's going on?
'You'll see, 'said the dispatcher.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran into the hallway.
Then the door of the chief's office opened, and the chief appeared.
Tight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, quickly turning on the two buttons of the uniform jacket.
"Good morning," was the answer, and I ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone with which the old man replied.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I greatly appreciated.
She was the chief of staff before she was deposed by her comrades.
There's checks, and you'll be there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk too much about it.
They say they're every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty embarrassing.
At least for some.
They say I'll see.
I pulled a folder with periodic reports from the shed and then the phone.
"Here, Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice said.
What's bothering you?
Now we met and nothing ..." I muttered, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I came at your command," I reported, barely entering the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the desk, looking at a piece of paper.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully examining the paper, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the sheet on the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, snotty glance.
I'm insecure.
What's going on? What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised that during those few months in office I had worked very well and that he was extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I nodded that I had been using such a greeting since I was a child, that I had been so brought up that I could see nothing wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," the headman said.
Plus, you're still messing with your superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the second time you say "comrade".
But I am not a chieftain to you, but a comrade chieftain.
The deputies are comrades-in-command, the top trackmasters are comrades-in-command!
Please remember that!
I'm sorry, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of a job or a comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," the chief said coldly, calming down a little.
There will be talk of that.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid retirement chair up there.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his preference, it didn't look good.
He pierced me for a moment with a cold, slick look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his high-pitched gag.
He was only a few years older and he was playing god, actually comrade god.
Jovial, puffed up, authoritarian, arrogant, as he was right now.
They all pissed him off.
Yeah, he's the chief.
In fact, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, like all parties, but also non-partisans, tapped him.
But the chieftain was fond of many, especially those for whom he could exercise his supremacy.
He just wiped me out for total bullshit.
I thought about my ass, and it cost me a lot of effort not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to the sledgehammer, let alone to continue to be a railroad official.
What would I feed two kids?
And a built-in house!
I was crying, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief said, and began to re-examine the leprosy he had in his hand.
At 12:30 I was called in.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, it would be good.
Only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in bitingly said, as was his custom, that they could not throw us all out, because the comrade chief would have to do the work alone with his faithful, and that there was no danger.
The word "comrade" was emphasized, as if he knew what the old man had erased me for in the morning.
There was a nice meeting in the headroom.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long advisory table, other comrades who were to decide whether or not I was an official.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k, ROH chairman, HR clerk, special purpose referee, something like a military counter-offensive, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the streak.
Ordinary railroad worker, battering frets or forks, throwing gravel.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, he said, a pretty beast.
Evil tongues claimed that he had left school in the seventh grade, had learned nothing, had learned nothing.
And when the crime scene was abolished, he ended up on a sledgehammer.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an inseparable cone in my neck.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k read an opinion from the Citizens' Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, I have two children, and so on and so forth.
So far, it's good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then an opinion from the party's street organization.
He was copying an opinion from the Citizens' Committee, perhaps both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents, longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently spoke from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief said he should continue.
It was just getting worse.
I was a member of the SSM city committee and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and had a wedding in addition to the national committee in the church.
I disappointed the party in the worst way possible.
That's why I was removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, had a church funeral, even though she was a former member of the party.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre finished reading, only the chief's pencil tapping on the desk board interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wanted to be far away.
At the same time, I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I rather stay with the blacksmiths?
I could have repaired the switches without some fucking background check.
But now?
The career of a railway official took over before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief's gonna kick me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade under discussion?" the chief interrupted with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to a review from a previous job.
Do you have him here?
Clearly, it wasn't too many times for the cuddler.
He blinked nervously on his sweat-drops, as if he had been checked himself.
He nodded fervently and handed the chief some paper.
'Well, 'said the chief, with a hint of joviality, which was often a foretaste of the storm.
At first glance, all praise, taught with honors, graduated from the industrial school, worked in the task salary as a locksmith, he fulfilled the norm on average to one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?" he turned again to the cadre, who felt that somehow it was beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even have to be a cadre.
This is where my comrade gave it to me, on the way in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the squad to the precinct," said the cadre.
And there's no need for testimonials, his was kind of an extra one, so I put it in his file.
"So this piece of paper was enough for you when you entered the technical function," the chief said dryly.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k blinked nervously and had no answer.
"That's all right, we'll discuss it later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was apparently relieved.
For now, it's settled.
'What about you, comrade? 'said the chief again.
All of a sudden he's yelling at me, so it's over!
My eyes were darkened, and the heat poured over me.
A wave of remorse and accusation followed, and I knew that I was the most disgusting creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest pity.
That I had misled the comrade of the cadre clerk by injecting an incomplete opinion, while I did not understand why the opinion was incomplete when I received it from the cadre clerk in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element, which, in the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in the practice of religious obscurity.
That, yes, there was a lot of things I'd done, or maybe I'd still do, and I prayed silently for it to end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I flew out of the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took that pickle from me.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
'That's enough, comrade chief, 'said the leader of the party, and he interrupted the chief of the levity.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did stupid!
He has already received his punishment.
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while?
To open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so readable or parroted phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who should give it to him, if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty, indeed, to support this young, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to correct it!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of you!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother she not only punishes, but that she also loves.
When the president was finished, no one even sniffed.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the chief said icyly in an effort to take the initiative again.
If you had let me finish, you would have heard that this was the conclusion I was reaching.
They all nodded in agreement, but they could see that they didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the role of an independent caregiver for basic resources," I murmured on my way back to the office, and then I cried.
Fortunately, except for engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She listened silently to my incoherent account of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the stove and made mugs.
In the meantime, she talked about cadre practices.
As one testimonial, often full of praise, is put into a person’s hand, and the other, in which there is any dirt, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to end up, but at the strudel at the pumpkin, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He's just old enough to eat or drink, and that's how it turned out.
'He'll catch it from the old man, 'she said malignantly.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Be careful of him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
In fact, a far worse chief, no humane.
Zero from a potato with a lot of power.
The coffee water began to boil, and then the office was filled with the smell of the coffee that had just been poured.
I put a sugar cube in the cup and quietly stirred the hot potion.
I guess I'm the worst out there.
They won't fire me now, and more checks won't be in three years.
Anyway, comrade chief won't forget my day.

The symbol of the community came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is turning again after years.
It can be seen from afar because it is located on a fifteen-meter high mast.
People around the world call it "the wind on Chlum."
For the village, 150 inhabitants even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the village received for the occasion of the meeting of the natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at that time, and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone around knows it," said the mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when the local people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It wasn’t until 1910 that Chlum’s representatives decided on a solution that would suit them until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch to <0xC4><0x8C><0xC3><0xAD>chov, a seven-meter-deep well was dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Kunc from Hranice in Moravia at a cost of CZK 2,400," the memorial inscription on the ground wall of the mast construction says.
The pump, after several repairs and falls of the windmill, was completed in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: on that day, a new water supply began to be used in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The Dominant was launched at this year's meeting of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlums decided to repair the wind turbine and put it back into operation.
They were allowed to make a replica of the original wheel - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on the mast, but it had to be lowered the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not resist the gusts of the wind.
Then the Chlum Dominant rested for several years, dismantled under the roof.
However, since June this year, the wheel on the high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the municipality had the replica of the wheel modified and re-installed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws the useful water from the well only into the attacking blind shoulder.
And during the summer, we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the windwheel from the pump in the suction basket again," Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind turbine got into the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of its kind in the whole Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region.
A similar element in the emblem is in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelena Hora in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, Partutovice in P<0xC5><0x99>erov or in the Police in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafayette, admitted the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and I remember my goal, like everyone in my career," 34-year-old Goian smiled at a pre-match press conference.
We were trained by George Hagi at the time, and it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope to score a goal now for Sparta.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopwatch, he will face the attacks of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Greek Spartan Hyb<0xC5><0xA1>.
He knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai very well, who played in Astra with my brother Luciano.
At the time, I saw all their matches.
I know he's a very good striker, which is why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name any other players of the Prague club, so the direct question came whether he knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at Czech journalists with a slightly reproachful look.
The helpless expression on his face meant, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He has really good players.
And Lafat?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
“He has experience from bigger clubs, it can be said that he is holding the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game,” said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has had his best years, but he has a very interesting football resume.
At one time Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him, but from Steaua he headed to Palermo, Italy, and also played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, fights for victory in the Czech league.
He is my favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is looking forward to his opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading in shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the Group’s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the framework of the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, Financial Director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the Group's headquarters, shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Stock Exchange in Prague, the company is completing a prospectus of securities, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and related transfers of shares will take the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating.
Therefore, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors as part of this operation.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016.
The company said in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Testing the objectivity of Czech television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the main news broadcast of the Czech Television.
And how did it hold up?
When they teach the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can launch today’s broadcast of Czech Television Events.
About 80% of the news coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Only at the first minute, when the <0xC4><0x8C>T reported about the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers, they euphemistically called their patience exhausted - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already going - judge the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a great space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Traveling Refugees - The Czech Republic consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee, not a migrant.
The most striking thing is that the Czech Television consistently uses only shots of young children and women in illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda unparalleled by communist agitators.
As a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once managed to get into the apartment, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
My ribs have moved into the snail's toilet.
Domestic fish, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing that transformation from caterpillar to beetle and young looks like an adult, only is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want to kill them.
First by hand and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, it eliminated them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.
A box with a kind of juvenileizer, which the ants brought to their nest and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned it off.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can be replaced by another.
The truth about fleas and bedbugs, I probably wouldn't hesitate to make my karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fish do not climb behind our necks, let them eat the crumbs of fallen skin, some invisible eyelashes and the like.
Their peaceful existence was eventually disturbed by the spider.
It was a common type of antler that had been sitting on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought that he lived from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on fish and that he apparently kept their number in a bearable numerical state.
By regular contact with every need we have made, we have found out that it is a female.
For we have seen romantic pleadings with a partner about a third smaller, how carefully he clings to the filaments of the web, so that he will not be eaten before he reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days when they did not move and did not react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
Partly they were eaten by their mother, partly they ran away.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
Whether she left or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that ancestor of the toilet.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior and moved under the toilet bowl to evaluate our non-aggression as friendship.
The number of the somewhat enlarged fish had decreased again, and the spider was quietly looking at its usual activities to secure food.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed all year.
Our daughter, meanwhile, reached an age when the use of a potty was already a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already been eaten by us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more strongly.
But her daughter found an excuse to keep up her bad habit in that spider she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk of seeing a spider didn't take much luck in the house.
Crying and wailing, she forced her potty.
It wasn't left.
There came a time when the spider had to give orders, in the interest of her daughter's developmental shift.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and thrown across the balcony into the garden.
I said good-bye to him as a friend, but I felt just as bad after living with him for so long as throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fins would start appearing more often and would start multiplying in a geometric series.
The world wondered, for a week or two, none of them showed up.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider hadn't grown them in the manner of ants, that the environment of the toilet wasn't as conducive to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they swarmed again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I realized that their bond to the spider must have had a cause, that if they didn't see it, that it was hidden somewhere else, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance triggered some alarming reaction.
Especially since I have no illusions about their vision.
They showed some light shyness, but that they would react to hand-waving or rapid movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot about the potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider.
I'm already sending my wishes to the air, and I hope they didn't turn me down after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cycle B.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of the brilliant scientist of the last century, apparently, will never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to immerse himself in everything so deeply that the result was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He entered into the consciousness of people primarily with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It is also impossible to forget its clarification of the photo-effect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that they prefer easy examples for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it wouldn’t have been Albert Einstein if he hadn’t found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: A watch near your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour — and that’s relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his entire pleiade of famous quotes the ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, brilliant people try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No number of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one can prove that I was wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the clutter on the table is a reflection of the clutter in the mind, what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War III, but in World War IV, it's going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing too little is dangerous and knowing too much.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that my life would depend on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive not to mention Einstein’s formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is to keep one’s mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n Region expect changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them are kept in black numbers this year," said Chief Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>k.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
The share in this is mainly higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, thanks to this, it is inclined towards buildings that together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of time when we bought mainly appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top health care can not be done, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Regional Deputy for Health Care, explained the plans.
Changes are expected in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, they are now selecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, they have a dialysis extension planned.
Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> intends to add a new inn for about 200 million for this year’s open central pavilion.
And the long-delayed construction of a new central income and inn, which will require three-quarters of a billion, awaits the Bata hospital in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
In all cases, these are major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the entire region, patients and doctors," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prouskov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the hospital, for example, to the construction of the Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n internal hospital.
The five-storey building is to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which are widely recognized by patients, will affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are not positioned, the windows are leaky and the health workers do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our inn was built 35 years ago and now it is on the verge of its life," said Pavel Cal<0xC3><0xA1>bek, director of the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to emergency income.
Thus, doctors and patients will have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model has already half finished Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The central income is already standing, and in three years an intern will be added to it.
"We will pay for the building from the loan and partly from our own funds," Director Petr Sl<0xC3><0xA1>dek explained.
This hospital is the only one in the region that can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest and did not reach the loss even two years ago, when, for example, the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital faced a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajd<0xC3><0xA1>k, who is in charge of the economy, said.
The patients of the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> hospital will also improve.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the capture station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

No one has explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) complains after talks with his European counterparts that other Czech states are pushing for the adoption of quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep allotted refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live in our country anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot speak of migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they are redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive an answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year now, and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We've dealt with forty thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
How do we keep these people in the area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their destination country, get asylum here, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, from Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don’t even want to come to us, but we have already committed 15 hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to take more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even for the 1,500, the point is that there will be 1,100 people with whom we will handle the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same as the ones we picked up.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that even the 1100 will not be kept on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will leave for Germany once they arrive.
If we can detain them during the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of the European statistics receive international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who are going to move.
This is the second project that is underway so far, and there we have only progressed in debating with the churches the possibility that they might be able to help them find jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss the ministerial meeting with us.
But isn’t it that the Czech Republic is simply rejecting quotas, but is not offering any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives the impetus that all migrants from Syria can come to them, then the news spreads in the order of hours throughout all the camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This invites another migration wave that is heading for Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - simply deter those migration waves, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Clearly let them know they don’t stand a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovans came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the public prosecutor's offices.
If we were to separate them and not accept them or only accept them according to the needs of the economies, the fifty percent of what social systems give them in vain today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day that Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far is it going to go to tighten border controls?
We were afraid of catching hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we manage.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it as standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, it is complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - this is a completely useless story.
Where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, our capacity will be exhausted enough to trigger crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are several times a day in telephone contact.
If the situation were to arise, the government could sit down in fact immediately, and with one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police by an army, say a customs administration, or a prison service.
The extreme variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests rather that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off most of her debts at the last minute.
This is to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia has paid its debts.
The footballers also got their money.
On Tuesday, football star Slavia stood trial for the first time in an insolvency proceeding.
Almost three months after Online Services from Pacific Samoa filed a bid for about 20 million crowns.
Legal representative Slavia Zuzana Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> tried to convince judge Michaela Wenzlov<0xC3><0xA1> within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And I have to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>im<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B> became the new owner of Slavia.
Apparently, the money came from the new owners to the club, at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vr<0xC5><0xA1>ovick<0xC3><0xBD> club sent tens of millions of crowns on Monday, just a day before the court hearing.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said lawyer Slavia Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representant Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Li<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenicki.
On Friday, the club also paid the fees owed to the city district of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, only claims that Slavie contradicts remain de facto.
According to the club, these obligations have not arisen at all, or they are litigated.
However, we are ready to pay the amount in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove with an extract from the account," Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> told the judge.
"Everything that was after the due date is paid," Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek said, adding that only outstanding or disputed liabilities are not paid.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid those debts.
Then all the evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can be expected in November.
The judge ordered the hearing to continue on November 3.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technology, hardware and software integrated into the modular design brings benefits and quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
From welding of structural steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of coarse materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible number of welding curves, simple adjustment and extensibility of the welding source allows you to quickly respond to changing requirements, which leads to reduced downtime, the need for switching the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding by cutting-edge welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
Time is no longer wasted and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which had its premiere in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We highly appreciate these honors, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter control, FastMig X is one of the world's top.
For those interested, the delivery times, which range from about three weeks, are certainly pleasant.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly expand after the Brno fair.
We have been its regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasises Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi store in Pilsen, for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built so that she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been beaten more safely, the expert says.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way as not to cause two land collapses in Prague’s Stromovka, according to the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a journalist's tour of the tunnel.
However, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The driver will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovec were the same all the time, but the land fell just a few steps from where it began to grow by a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, and in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the Euro weekly.
According to the original plan, the construction cost 17 billion crowns.
If you add the VAT, which doubled during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
Add to this technology, land purchases and engineering, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37, said B<0xC4><0x9B>loglav.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx Mixed Profits, Fiscal Outlook Reduction for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in year-round profit forecasts due to low freight demand and higher ground division costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average interest rate increase of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transportation of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The company’s chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, said the company “has performed solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade.”
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, roughly the same as it did last year.
In the quarter that ended in August, 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, as predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the performance of the FedEx ground unit.
Land revenues rose 29 percent in the last quarter, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit fell in freight trade due to higher labor prices.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week seated at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table and decide whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Standing above them at one end of a central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor in too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to kick-start while weaning off an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates on the ground since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed into adding to volatility by raising its federal funds benchmark rate – and that’s no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to hold off on the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if politicians soften the decline by promising that a further increase is not in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,598.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians will hold rates steady this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed now raises rates,” he said.
If the Fed’s politicians did, “they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold hands with the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rates to rise this year through spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed in August, the labour market saw solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage earnings showed signs of lifting.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to tumble at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16 percent below its record value in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has bounced somewhat this month, and the Dow is now only losing nearly 10% of its May high.
The uneasy market situation provides the Fed with a complex calculation of when to start raising the interest rate.
“In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about how this will affect the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the entire world.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “abuse” their monetary expansion in the market has triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy making that pushed for higher rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions "despite the limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize financial stability concerns during the Great Depression, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee.
The latest bustle is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/warehouse is the only point of contact that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a bit of engine oil.
The shop is massive and it will take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you’re hungry for shopping, go for a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various outlets.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.
Among the fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash you and kick you out, even fry it for you, if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezer compartment, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, loosely sold semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
Wide streets meet shopping carts and forklifts.
Finding: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Speed on the highways will remain the same.
The House rejected the acceleration to 150 km/h.
On selected motorway sections, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House of Commons decided so when it agreed to an amendment by the Senate, which rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now go to the President.
At the end of April, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said that the law allowing one hundred kilometers of speed would veto.
Transport Minister Dan <0xC5><0xA4>ok (for YES) also opposed the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network has not yet been built at this speed.
On Tuesday, MPs voted in favour of the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, to increase speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane ones.
The House first extended this option to motorways, which could be driven at selected speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
Senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the authorization of the traffic police to have the final say in the regulation of local communications, which are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the House, also envisages that sewers, water pipes or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally under the road surface.
The city would save money on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to care for road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles that owners do not report.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which their owners will not report within six months after notification of the towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory on second and third class roads under the threat of fines even for freight forwarding companies.
The amendment also removes the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of the existing paper ones, which will be used after January 1 of next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>-expressor is going to court.
He faces 10 years for the overpriced welcome of the citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced Welcome to Citizens project.
The police wanted to prosecute the MP Zuzana Kailova (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), but the Chamber of Deputies did not release her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both men face up to 10 years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutors, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k and Mac<0xC3><0xAD>k caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city’s management unlawfully made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k ordered the then head of the municipal department of urban services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the tender.
When another company entered the competition, which offered the lowest price, the town hall canceled the competition.
The city was to entrust the contract to the administrator, and only the company Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid at least $1 million more.
Both accusations, led by the aim of ensuring that Darothore was awarded a public contract for the organization of the Welcome of Citizens event in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, acted in a long-term and coordinated manner, at least in violation of the requirement to proceed with the care of a good economy.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore would charge <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem a price that would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided, following the receipt of this contract.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least a million crowns.
Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k had previously rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this constructed case, the former mayor said earlier, saying that the city under his leadership only followed a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k added.
The criminals originally wanted to indict MP Kailov<0xC3><0xA1>, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the House of Representatives did not issue it to the prosecution.
The criminals therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect to charge Kailova after her parliamentary mandate expires.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift cheque for 5 thousand crowns for the purchase of children's belongings and small gifts.
Hungarian police say they have released a dog on the fugitive.
Then they forced the journalists to delete the record.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a recording of a police dog allegedly driving a refugee to the ground.
The Hungarian government, however, disputes this accusation.
An alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke crossing the border with Serbia.
Police intervened against the refugees and one of them let a certain Syrian man attack a dog with a basket on his face.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," knocked down, says Muzi.
One of the policemen noticed that Muzi was filming everything and did not let him go.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Officers took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
He lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP has sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zolt<0xC3><0xA1>n Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
She called the behavior of police officers unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not have to worry about the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs, referring to Muzi's police report, questioned the account of the events.
He said the police only wanted a journalist to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to erase anything.
“Dogs can bark — they’re trained to deter and scare a bit, but they don’t attack with certainty,” Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
Winning City will kick us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the hometown.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many opportunities, but we had the ball on the footballs longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," Pellegrini, whose team collected in the competition after 636 minutes, said.
The finalist of last season Juventus was exactly the opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league as a defender of the title has only a point and with a score of 2:4 is only in the 16th place of the table.
The turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manjukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, hopefully thanks to him we will ride on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
My players deserve this result.
"We could have scored 0-2 before our goal, but Gianluigi supported us," said Buffon's coach Allegri.
'We've burned a few good chances, 'said Yaya Touré, City midfielder.
We have to take lessons from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Farewell to Angelo, Farewell to Old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media friction around is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a minute.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically causes a feeling of guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they don't just come here desperate kids, notice in the pictures of landing boats to the Greek islands that the baby on them is not so much visible!
And somehow recently, pictures of ships heading to Lampedusa, refugees outside the French border near Menton, where thousands of young men lie on beautiful promenades, have disappeared from television.
Mostly young blacks.
And also disappeared pictures from Callais, where these eaters and black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I don't think he's taking it anymore.
Even these images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow concealed that they are not only unhappy children from Syria, but also enameled - for the elderly: fashionably fashionable - young men.
Whose musculature looks like they just got out of some fitness center.
Only one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And young black men came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed up in branded clothes and shoes, smartphones in their hands, as it were.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested, and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken over all the deck chairs.
Whoever did not lie on it and was in the sea, had bad luck.
They were dressed like American rappers.
On the heads of the hat with a nail, white and colored Adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started feasting.
They filled tables around, stuffed themselves with sitting next to the brown and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace to a quiet place.
Incoming blacks drank beer straight from thirds - as in the US TV series?! - on the beach throwing empty bottles around.
They kept yelling at each other.
But it wasn’t in English.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, screamed and screamed in the water, mothers with children and pensioners fled in horror, and within half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Whether you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me half-loudly in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
'Well, they certainly didn't have it from work, 'said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a twenty-centimeter-long massive cross of gold around his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
'You saw them drinking, 'said the waiter.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 it was not so important for me.
I had no idea what would happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known that first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were sent to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has emerged that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and the lobbyist and economically important groups attached to them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognised main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the top EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent TV images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV images of August 1968.
Sure, there were a couple of sunflowers at the station, but most importantly - the Old Germans - Muslims welcomed their fellow tribesmen.
For many weeks, they were chatting on news on Czech Television, saying that, according to some research, Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But those who have only been in Germany for a few days know that it is a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, the famous public opinion survey organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported, too.
However, they concealed what broke in Germany the next day: that in the poll to the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - the survey was attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago: “Our effort to ‘multi-cult’ society has completely failed.”
She added: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All attempts at such coexistence have failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has failed. Today, they live with us and we lied to ourselves for a while that they will not stay, that they will disappear again one day.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we say we are simply living happily together, has failed.
Totally failed.
But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly escalating.
Euro-German Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, a SPD member, the only one who allegedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one about which Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play the supervisor in the concentration camp from the minute - has shown himself as repeatedly.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, apart from some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and killer of millions?
Are those who say that there is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence in the soul of Germany right?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Greater Germans to take control of the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was removed, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After an attempt by the Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany, for example, ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunflower.
The German elites had long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, and so they left all those anti-atom warriors, enthusiastically seeking a paradise for all, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogans Our Forest Must Live.
To satisfy the restless young people, who everywhere in the world want to do something different and better, fully bow to the side of the fighters against warming the planet, stop nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that in this stream there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - the so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream, which considers all Slavs to be difficult to escape - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as recent statements by Schulz and German ministers openly threatening disobedient eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be listened to without apology.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we add to that the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, is capital, especially German, to which it suits, and which benefits from the fact that Germany, in fact, through banks and the Union, controls most of the states of Europe.
The Sunflower Pseudo Confidence first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it has brought home millions of Muslims.
Which, enticed by the sirens, will soon run into a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and begin to revolt.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours with force once again, it can once again make a part of its population - but, as it seems, an ever smaller part - ideologically insane, but in the end reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the incoming Islamists break out?
Will Muslims who have been living in Germany for a long time come to their aid, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, watching with fear the Islamization of their country, take over?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when the people rise up, who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-super-human Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that Europe has provoked by the support of the sunflower ideology, that is, the ideology of the elite and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the relentless treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, it cannot go well.
Completion tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of insidious sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and a sturdy knock knocked on you in a way that weaker natures may not stand up to.
A resuscitated head will wipe you off nicely and drive the obstinate away, and a resuscitated statue will accompany (or rather drive) the resuscitated seller.
Perhaps it is a pity that the talking knob can not be purchased even in reality.
It would be useful to drive away a lot of bums and scum as well.
Rosehip (Oxalis corniculata).
Small weeds that tolerate dry environments.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which, although it belongs to the expansive weeds, creates a nice impression in terms of flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's insecure, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easy to adapt, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and photographing it further.
Under close scrutiny is the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet during breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding with pictures of babies sucking from breasts painted with an image of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are recommended to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected their children’s genetic makeup and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show
The escape of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the costs of the liberal leadership leak failed to create a sufficient rating increase for Today.
Nine morning show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter so much to the viewers of Aussie TV, as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise had an average of 349,000 viewers and Today had 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting Parliament more than just this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for the question!

The big news for Seven was the stunning 800-word debut with former Star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has an average of very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself would be able to tighten a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night says a clear "yes".
The X Factor by Seven retained a strong 1,136 million viewers, defeating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000) smoothly.
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of Andrew O'Keefe's new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and an average of 720,000 spectators.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the drop in The Chase Australia’s rating from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secrets Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unintentionally figured out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who remain standing will definitely not reveal who is the one who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday’s final.
All three women lyrically chanted why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons to want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who's going to get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler about who's going to win Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship since one day.
“From the moment I walked into the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They feel good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a nice couple.
She claims that during his last visits at home, she realized that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer just a game - I opened my heart to him," he said.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, to look mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snow White and Lana indecisively.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30am on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and many teams were asked about his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he did in the Australian rugby league's first kick-off of Tuesday's 20-3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him into play after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and take care of the next game.
During the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for during his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught cheating when he left the field by mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start of his career in the NFL he could not have imagined.
"That's what happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal territory led to the Queensland Trio.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of fans holding the Australian flag on Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while aiming guns at a Siberian ranway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The <0xC3><0x9A>S defended the emigrants, who demanded the replacement of property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Out-of-Court Rehabilitation Act.
The court first assigned them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the court of appeal changed their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and the amount originally charged to them.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the <0xC3><0x9A>S with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - although at that time it was an adequate compensation in relation to the seized property - today reaches only a fractional amount of the value of the property.
"This cannot come to the burden of secondary participants as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been claiming their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier," explained the judge's rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the <0xC3><0x9A>S sided with the emigrants.
"The Court has repeatedly argued that the general courts should proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of the restitution legislation, i.e. the compensation of property wrongs caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1>.
By the way, Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> became the world’s youngest Evita when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Per<0xC3><0xB3>n in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague’s Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says: "To this day, Evita's demands have not been matched by much of the performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
The role of the first lady of Argentina was recommended by Monika Absolonov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I saw Moncha three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly, I saw a whole new concept.
I’m a big fan of modernization, but this one is really good.
"The directorship of Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol is original, light and contemporary," Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> says.
The musical sceptre between the two singers will be handed over at the Monika Absolonov<0xC3><0xA1>’s Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Don't Cry For Me Argentina!)
In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also step down from the directing desk, when he will be acting as President of Per<0xC3><0xB3>n during the filming of Karel Roden’s film.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech performance of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol, the main female role was originally performed by Monika Absolonov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Karel Roden appears as president of Per<0xC3><0xB3>n and as Che Peter Stren<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ik.
The legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prost<0xC4><0x9B>jovsk<0xC3><0xBD> are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof Mark, who participated in the first performance at the Spir<0xC3><0xA1>la Theatre.
4 People Killed After Police Shoot Rubber Missiles At Protesters In Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against a draft state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a leading district officer, said more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under a proposed new constitution, and has eased their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted this week in Kathmandu on the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely shouldn't panic now.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about in the middle between the Cape Verdean Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone formation over the next two days, a weather forecaster based in Miami added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help the thousands of refugees who flooded European states as they fled war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted the report on her blog on the basis of personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul at the age of seven.
“We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigrant crisis in Europe, more and more families, like my own, are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among four non-profit organizations helping refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all contributions made through google.com/refugeelief to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, wracked by a four-year war that displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery used to reduce the stomach various methods.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates a person is overweight and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and gastrectomy – in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, only 1 percent and only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved for diabetes comparison.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol were shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers said.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drug-treated group, this value remained at about 8%.
But this better “glycemic control” — reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent), and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to life extension, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29% more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to the group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, it is a soothing result for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really difficult.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that, under the present circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
Taking care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
“The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “the US violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have consumed a sanitation agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the Toxicology Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the number of ingestions of sanitary products in children under 12 years of age that were reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the sanitation deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
YouTube videos show teens drinking sanitation because of a cheap riot.
Teens reportedly mixed a sanitation product with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the product.
"Children don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitary) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges are available, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitation product contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially for young children, several curls can mean alcohol poisoning.
“This is highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Toxicology Control Center at Fox Station 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey roll, either, but people leave these sanitation supplies outside, and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four locks of strawberry-scented sanitation reagent at school and was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is double the threshold considered to be intoxication in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered vague words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation products to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products have been associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitation product that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Physicians believed that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary products and forbade their presence in the room.
The police considered the failed plan "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fame: No discrepancy on the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays rumors of a Celtic mismatch, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that new reinforcements from January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty, played by ADAMA Rooney, secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodria, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies rumors of mismatch
This situation sparked gossip about the Celtic mismatch, which was denied by Griffiths, who insists he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of Scottish title rivalry bored the Netherlands - de Boer
Former midfielder Rangers and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer say Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax’s ambassador, said: “The Netherlands is no longer showing the best of Celtic’s games, and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They talk about the two teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Firm matches and it is not just the people from Scotland who watch these games.
I'll turn things back to good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little stumbling, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to good.
Malmö's defeat and subsequent relegation from the Champions League were quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current situation.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic, because it makes the players much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago suggesting that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is worried about the massive purchase of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer one.”
Players who come in the summer have the entire pre-season to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there is more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Micha's transfer target indicates retirement
Swansea's attacker Micha, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, suggested he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old shooter has had problems with his prone ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3–2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled – this is the third red card issued by referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by his statement and states, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely rebuked after admitting he was singing a song with lyrics directed at former Hearts player Rudolf Sk<0xC3><0xA1>cel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was an intense moment," the assailant said, continuing, "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in Celtic's jersey."
The Council of Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United's board still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold out desperately against the Hamilton Acces to win a seventh straight league win and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty in the first half played by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, be it cups or leagues, without winning this type of game.”
Scottish Unemployment Remains Unchanged as UK Total Unemployment Rises
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that in the UK (5.5 percent), according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now stalled to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest figures: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Was Witnessing the Oklahoma Execution
Later today, in spite of late legal intervention, I will watch a man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's death chamber and seeing Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being conducted that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the entire execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I will sit beside Richard Glossip’s closest friends and have formed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I’ll just have to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admits that she could have articulated it better, but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help with the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist at the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I’ve created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of the murder.
I certainly believe that insufficient evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm being really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love, die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he rescued a man from Canning River.
The Peter man’s bet that he would escape the police did not come after he got into shallow muddy water just meters from the policeman who tried to force him back to shore.
Canning Vale police were called in an incident spanning over Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come get me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics, police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove a car into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody Says Organizers Tried to Spy on Him and Threaten to End Races
Peeter Moody accused the organiser of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately end the race.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria, and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai during maintenance on race day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidar’s positive cobalt swab that he couldn’t explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of espionage for 18 months and didn’t want it to look like “dry grapes.”
“I didn’t want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — who I’m going to name after the question — and they offered him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables,” Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me they completely burned me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside of coaching positions to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they are.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will put pressure on them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels increased with long-term investigations into cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch in him gave him the feeling that he "could watch his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the treatment rule on race day as "ridiculous" after the horse was applied clay lining or mud on its feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
Someone on my team mistakenly put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of tiles on the day of the race, to which the organizers have already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobra driver who ran away was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra this weekend and drove away after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with non-stop in an accident, non-assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back at Rivals Over Wrestling Claims
Craig Bellamy, the coach of Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' interventions as "setting a plan" by two NRL favorites of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during Storm's controversial victory in the Sydney qualifying final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a lightly veiled remark on Strom after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" of the rugby league and he said the two Queenslanders weren't "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that the situation had boosted his self-confidence as his team was criticized by two top coaches, which could mean they were afraid of losing to Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques over the past year, we have only put emphasis on contact during the interventions in recent weeks, and this has been a turning point for us.
“Trent has been here for three years and he’s obviously coaching a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this year's part.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 Premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George were criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds reversible, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said this in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the match Storm and Roosters fell more goals than in the match Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scores interesting?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will definitely meet again at this stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland was given a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from a Solay yacht that came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting with the defendants in the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice defended that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could be in a cafe completely by chance and innocent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic would have escaped.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather jointly offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of both persons, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them,” said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, as the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and observes a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged on to her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up and found her phone missing, then found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a "disturbing" search on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then told police that his reason was to “lead pedophiles” on the Internet before he “pretends to be a police officer and scares them.”
Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addiction – that he was addicted to people’s terror.
He admitted that he was searching the computer, but claimed that he was just pretending to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said he was drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking or providing inappropriate pictures of children on June 14 last year, violated bail terms on January 25, and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender list because he can argue that there was "no essential sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed his sentence to October for filing social worker reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody prior to hearing about other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes poor speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of parliament has also been tainted by opposition lawmakers’ claims that they received anonymous assassination threats that warned them against shouting out Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was squealed and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to impede Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had "fear" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard cuts 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save business services costs.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the PC and printer business from its faster-growing operations of enterprise hardware and services.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of around $2.7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive and sustainable structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the division.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses to help businesses transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will receive an annual revenue of more than $50 billion following the company’s announcement and “will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
This will lead to the dissolution of the company, which was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to handle the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in the industry based on the belief that a narrowly specialized company is performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also pointed out to Wilshere that it was still September and that if his rehabilitation went as planned, there was no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great regret of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back to his former form during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t endanger your career,” Wenger said.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he'd suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different Wilshere injuries since his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played only in 65 Arsenal league matches out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition,” says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m sure it will and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to embark.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 games after keeping the campaign "invincible" last season.
The stadium shook on Wednesday night with a 3.2-magnitude Richter earthquake.
This was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal learned from last season's Champions League when he capitulated against Monaco and has a distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup win.
"This commitment is tremendous," Wenger says.
That never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a high enough percentage of friends with “healthy moods,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends is half the chance of mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be achievable.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and game creator recently explained, money really doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, a moment of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
“My role as a listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest of friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying “to deal with it” is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the programs that come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my assignment, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater close, from a network of friends and family.
So if you’re going to the FriendsFest this weekend organized by Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - a full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored during his Champions League debut, helping PSG beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League, and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then they threw a few chances, until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even with three points, it wasn't the classic performance of Laurent Blanc's team, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted before the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, where he began his famous career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League either at home or outside, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents difficult and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve with the progress of the season,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we did not score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which made a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing was marked as the man who took PSG to a new level in Europe after the transfer from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why, when he ran on the pass of Marc Verratti for the defense of Malm, and with a beautiful finish sent the ball behind the back of Johan Wiland to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick off PSG’s spectacular win, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs and reached this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the base line-up and five defenders and two relegated midfielders being a heavy opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's shot, which just past the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG took advantage of the attack with poor passes and a poor finish, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the network shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he turned out to be much more suitable when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a rotating shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic scored him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all Malm's thoughts about the possibility that they could benefit from the match, and only Wiland's excellent close-up action shattered David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of alternating Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
Team manager Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying is not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore Makes $2.5 Billion Selling Shares
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by a collapse in commodity prices, made $2.5 billion from stock sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive plan to cut debt.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with commodity price softening as China’s slowing economy reduces demand and sparks destruction across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore’s stock prices to the top of London’s stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
The shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion in shares is part of a broader plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
They were stripped of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about prolonging China’s growth slowdown have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Washington Visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, where he visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen the U.S.-China relationship and encourages cooperation in addressing issues of international, regional and common interest and provides an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two countries,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is scheduled to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for a UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
A German-launched emergency flare is far from setting the European crew on fire, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro reported.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - than to quarrel over the future allocation of refugees by quota based on a quantity that is increasingly remote from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, EU interior ministers changed their priorities.
Rather than worrying about the final destination of refugees, the first thing to do is filter out those who are arriving today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the ministers said in a text they discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its determination and increasing pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of asylum-seekers in the country.
The Central Power makes it clear that no free movement is possible in Europe without it.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has done this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect, but also sees blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already entered the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re discussed the matter intensively during a private interview with their three counterparts from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that camps in which refugees accumulate at its expense will not remain on its shoulders.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, more than twice as many as recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has folded its hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of now common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying European Border Control Agency Frontex intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," the text submitted to the ministers for approval warns.
From the point of view of law, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the 28-year-old has put the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was set up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, on the second track.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in the text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, as already agreed during the EU’s Hectic Summit in June, Le Figaro said.
Seven people were killed in an avalanche in the Alps, including three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, there is also a woman who is the only survivor of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports said it was a Polish woman.
About 30-year-old woman with a serious leg injury in the femur area was hospitalized in the city of Briancon.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40-year-olds.
"The rescue operation is over and the bodies of the victims have been transported to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain region below the summit of the D<0xC3><0xB4>me de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service did not warn of bad weather in the area today.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match against Braga: Finally a real Europe.
Coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> during his debut in cups managed to pass through the European League to the base group with the Liberec players and is now looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
At the beginning of the main stage of the competition, Slovan welcomes the finalist from 2011 Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout fights, when every goal and every situation could have knocked you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every goal we collect, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by a mere doubles match.
"I am very looking forward to it and it is a real Europe, before that it was only a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
Bragu is considered the top team.
He will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may just be more difficult even because he does not have such a name, but at the same time he has a player in his frame who, I think, gave Manchester three goals.
"It is an excellent whole at the level of the top teams," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
He does not see Bragg as a clear favorite.
I take it we play at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown both in the domestic competition and in the pre-rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm this," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from the eleven matches of this season.
He believes that Liberec can also impose its style on Braze.
We are waiting for a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is unusually disciplined for them.
They play from 4-4-2 with a rapid transition to the attack phase.
"He is a very tough opponent, we have found weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the pitch," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
We studied the opponents a lot in the pre-races, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, even if it's going to be very challenging, to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will dominate P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, an international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works to the competition at the 15th International Student Film Festival in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek this year.
Four dozen of them, which the committee consisting of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be screened from 15 to 18 October in the cinema Porty<0xC4><0x8D>.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, Jakub Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t, the festival’s spokesman, said.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival soundtrack.
She's a detective this year.
Director of this year’s festive evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in this year's trailer," Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student works - feature films, animated and documentary.
They will be judged by an international jury, including last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the organizers of the festival prepare an accompanying program.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbochanson band Let’s Fly?, playful band Zrn<0xC3><0xAD> or for example Petra Hapkov<0xC3><0xA1> with the recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by Jana A<0xC5><0xA1>enbrennerov<0xC3><0xA1>, a graduate of the P<0xC3><0xAD>sek Film School and the winner of prestigious awards, among which there is also a World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will present the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Martin <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the cameraman and documentary filmmaker, will come to the attention of the visitors, Gerhard Gruber will accompany the silent film The Cameraman with his music, and the natives of P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> will baptize their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, patron of FAMO in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and filmmaking," the spokesperson said.
Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, take several job auditions at once and get a job, will certainly help.
The festival is associated with the establishment of the Private Higher Professional Film School in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Its founders, the couple Vladan and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>, organized the first year in 1997.
Until the sixth year, it was held once every two years.
In the event of bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies have to pay the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in case of bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
The House of Commons decided on Wednesday when it approved a revised amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which will be sent to the Senate for consideration.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end insurance of travel agencies against the crash, if the amendment will apply.
The proposal has also been criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to leave or leave the country.
Minister of Regional Development Karla <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Euro-comform.
She drew attention to this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it is feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice-President of TOP 09.
The bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
“Travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad,” Kalousek warned.
A member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousk’s concerns on the basis of a survey among members of the CK.
"Stop lobbying the insurance companies," he said.
The statements of the insurance companies do not consider Okamura to be relevant, there is no official written statement of them in this sense, according to him.
However, they are investigating whether travel agencies will make a contribution, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerov<0xC3><0xA1> (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about lubricating the stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” says Fischer.
The House did not approve of her proposal to release the disputed passage.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) also did not come forward with a proposal to return the draft to the committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip pointed to travel agencies that he said could endanger consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychov<0xC3><0xA1> (ANO), in view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
The novel will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of four million for travel agencies offering air travel and a limit of one million for offices selling, for example, bus travel.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the insurance performance limit will have to be such that, in the event of a travel agency’s bankruptcy, it covers all the claims of the customers.
Even after adjustments, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to re-indicate which travel agency organises the tour for the tours sold.
Travel agencies will have to provide insurance companies before concluding the contract, among other things, data on the management and the number of trips.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information of insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and trips sold, the total price of trips sold, and the amount of travel advances and sales and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has failed to comply with any of the legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will call on the insurance company to rectify it or will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could jeopardize the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to re-adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state funds in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the lawmaker did not think of the situation that would occur if the insurance company terminated the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize trips and clients who bought the trip before the cancellation of the insurance will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good condition.
One way that travel agencies can deal with this situation will be to sue the State for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and then we will operate on our market only as agencies, said the vice-president of the association, Jan Pape<0xC5><0xBE>.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains the institute of bank guarantee, but so ill-considered that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot sound for an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the Association, a change in the current practice is de facto useless.
Within two years, the whole law will have to be recast in view of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are currently operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CCs have ceased operations.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about 20 billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve the humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German prime ministers.
At the same time, she again called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member states.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will push for dignified conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German chancellor, according to whom such a signal could also be increased financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
The Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke have also spoken out in favor of speeding up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Brandenburg prime minister said.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees should be used to integrate those who have a chance of getting asylum.
It will take more teachers to get the refugees to learn German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if we manage to integrate refugees, they can become a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon plays down the diversity in the film.
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity, arguing that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO's Greenlight project, Brown was interrupted by the actor, who stressed the need for alternative views on the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it by starring in a movie, not by starring in a show,” Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted incensed and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the Martian commentary got on the air.
Damon and Brown have teamed up with producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I'd like to urge people to think, whoever the director is, about how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black character that's a hooker that's packed by a white pimp.
Producer of The Precious White People promoted finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s commentary.
MrPooni tweeted, “Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts.”
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national influence and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince made references to the movement while listing nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported to a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner"
Professional mountaineer and piccolo Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home $1 million.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors failed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of the season, the two men fought through to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb after more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first climber to reach the limit, becoming the first competitor to outlast the 4th leg of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News immediately after his hard-earned win and it was revealed that he was still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” said Isaac E! in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishes the track the fastest.
“If there are more competitors on the track, the one with the best time will win,” Weed said.
Although winning the main prize would have changed his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he's harboring resentment.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm reception from the fans.
He's a great guy, and he loves his family.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.”
Geoff told me, “If there was to be someone who could have beaten me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Tigers of Detroit have just passed the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the pink garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers narrowly reversed their defeat when they defeated Minnesota in a close 5–4 win at Target Field on Tuesday.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was a return of the word to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took the next in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 shots and 3 laps.
It was his third game in the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a fight when you’re sitting on a bench a lot and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tiger batter Victor Martinez hit three times and made two laps and his first rebound point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last game in June, in which he scored four times against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned on it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in training, he fired significantly better and he managed to get it into the game."
With three laps at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the best chance of returning to the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won the shift with two points on the left side of the pitch.
Right-wing polarizer Aaron Hicks scored a point with the bat set, and Simon struck out Brian Dozier before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only rival, Mauer, and had batter Miguel San in front of him, who kicked the ball and ran two goals, leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the pitch and a chance to draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third metre over two metres.
Plouffe has already won 27 laps over two goals this season and reigns in the league table.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon scored 5–4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed man knocked out San for three coincidences.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes's game.
The Tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against a retired right-hander who entered the game after more than a month's hiatus due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly didn't think I'd start like that," Hughes said, "but during my third shift, I felt like I was better at pitching."
After resisting the onslaught in the first shift, Hughes gave one point to the other, Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right polar J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez, who was the first to circumnavigate all finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
Third metre Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another lap, but Victor Martinez was knocked out when he tried to run for third.
The Tigers added in the second shift, when James McCann and Anthony Gose scored two and then one point, and a 3-0 score lit up on the scoreboard.
"That got us to our knees," said the Twins manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won on the number of shots, finished in the third shift without points and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three goals, scored six strikes and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right Tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is set to play in Wednesday's match.
Sanchez is replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who returns after injury to face the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded for left-back David Price, he has scored 1–1 after four games.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to a stretched muscle.
The Tigers and the Twins will play their third match at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left thrower Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi Calls for Opening the Economy to the Wider World
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said about the 16th session of the central head of the group to deepen the overall reform.
Promoting opening-up in emerging reforms will give new impetus and vitality, and will also provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the easing of border control policies, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up to identify sectors and businesses that are outside investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure that the companies themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card" by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the right of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, new bed divisions may be established.
According to Jakub P<0xC3><0xA1>nik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient, and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the wards of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care in the area.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, one-day surgery centers could be established, where, according to the established concept, surgical procedures would be performed that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
What specific hospitals should have a one-day surgery-focused workplace is not yet clear.
At the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center to care for patients with brain disorders who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological and resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility to the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, are the beds of follow-up care, especially the beds of the long-term ill (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should closely follow the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, aftercare beds are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
This is where abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
There is a shortage of these beds in the entire republic, so it could also serve as a so-called Alzheimer's center for other regions.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which funds from European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of specialised care and will create space for the translation of patients after surgery, for example, after cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplantation or other procedures," the regional concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
