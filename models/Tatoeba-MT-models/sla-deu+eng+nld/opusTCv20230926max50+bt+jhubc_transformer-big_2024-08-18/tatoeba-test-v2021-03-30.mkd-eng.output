It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her father.
How are you treated?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom said he would help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
It's one of mine.
You look like you're getting cold.
I like to walk.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He is a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not using Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a no-no.
How much is it worth?
The water was in our throats.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
It's probably still there.
It looked great.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows that.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from 7:00 to 9:00.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
It's mine, give it back to me.
Wolves were hunting the herd.
This song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did what Mary told him to do.
Show us where you found it.
I never thought I'd find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he tries to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
There's something I have to confess.
Alcohol had an effect on him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around him.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's cheeks are a little blushing.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have refuted it.
I have to help him.
He criticizes himself.
You'll know when the time is right.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit out the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
We didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop naming him Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom ate lunch later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham and eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary turned the movie around.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote the report himself.
Are they buying like this?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
Last night I saw a ghost.
I'm in London.
I won't be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do you really want to eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs out every time I get a cold.
We met several times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you can understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Has anyone else entered the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still had a price on it.
Tom said he would help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There has to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what it says in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if he asked for it.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd be here.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're man-eaters.
You don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run! Run!
Do you pay for the delivery?
I want the reptile.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass breaks easily.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one like that, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes transmit malaria.
You've been putting this off too long.
I don't understand.
That's pathetic.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also accept checks.
A newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonian has four verbal modes: pronounced, conditioned, commanded, and reproved.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her lines like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are correct.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Do not throw rubbish on the ground.
I remember meeting the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked furious.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom kicked my ass.
I was only an hour away.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't attract attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
There's no gas.
Tom is a troll.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I come with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was food.
Be careful not to get soiled in the muddy pond.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
The sauna is here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day they will try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a Russian room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They smiled quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap in his face.
Tom is not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before.
Who is the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly troubled to make speeches, because of the difficult speech defect.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him that Mary was not here.
The bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
I'm licking.
When do you study?
It was hard for Tom to swallow the pills.
It is worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by humanoids.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get to that right away.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
And for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the clamp.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made me.
Didn't you love the prize?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're glad.
You're being dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is blunt.
We went bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When should you renew your passport?
Mary does not have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
That's what I got from Tom.
There's no height in his story.
The battle was short.
How retarded I am!
We discussed this.
Tom grabbed the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
Electric heater heats ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys descend from the canopy.
Let's forget for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first I couldn't stand it.
He's got his sleeve on.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
They all left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They knocked next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone I was dead.
I think we found one.
The reporting deadline is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water got to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia really liked the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where to park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom had a beer out of a bottle of wine.
I fell off a bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks were torn apart.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate money.
I have it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But he cheated on her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did she ask for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-stage process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom ran over the gullet.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senf's really hot.
We advertise our products on television.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
This happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
You hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to leave soon.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They've blocked him.
Tom is struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What is that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you were hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom is in serious need of help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was a fag?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that the previous dentist told him that he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It seems wrong to me somehow.
Tom's a smart guy.
Curry powder is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a rough night for me.
Tom was driving around the city with the brakes up without noticing.
Yeah, well, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on staying here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks dubious.
Keep it to yourself.
Now you do, don't you?
I'm pretty inflated.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own behavior is also undesirable.
He wears high heels to make him taller.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't yell.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it matter?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're such a jerk.
Did someone hit Tom?
There's a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very active.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
Coffee gives you energy.
Tom was a nice guy.
Big meraclia is for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
You're gonna miss us, Tom.
Tom works for NASA.
Tom writes well.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan was no longer safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to throw the idea away.
Tom is really annoyed.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all perceive her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to put our tent.
That was beautiful.
Just let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve everything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
That's exactly what Tom wanted me to meet.
You should ask for their help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom's richer than we thought.
I never intended to deceive you.
What the hell was all that about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicide.
Wings, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom's got his knee covered.
Where did the pi<0xC3><0xB1>ols come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It is made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom stepped forward, and the crowd applauded.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked really hard, but he didn't make it.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink carbonated drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the tipon.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You cook turkey with bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let it be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
She took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking, bowed down.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I feel much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want to be seen.
It's a pity the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a cocksucker.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm tough.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He is always fluent in English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
None of the pigs died.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The car has four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very useful.
Tom vibrated his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time. You can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear it.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thinks about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
What time is it now?
You get it?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got what he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I would do anything for your red eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I will never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes the idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems to be having fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care of yourself!
Linda had nausea, and she doubted she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the main gate.
The meeting began more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I will do what I know and can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's getting better.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a promiscuous dress.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst type of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
The beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't exactly seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven’t solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He has big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before the age of one, so they are eaten by humans.
Could you pull an arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see her?
He's wasting his money like water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times not to exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book weighs.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's lying to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very bad attenuating sounds. I hear him in the next room chewing mastic!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk around the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you touching me?
Please, talk to me.

Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not the other way around.
Tom is sleeping well.
Be smart and don't tell your family about it.
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen napkins.
I'm safe.
The eyebrows look strange to you.
That's why I can't help you.
I have not yet found the time to write this report.
I can do it without it.

The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to snort?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
And the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the line-ups.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was spilled with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you so much, Tom.
We're going to eat cherries from Italy this afternoon.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.

I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need some sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsocial.
Evening suits me.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The tiles that fell from the roof were torn apart.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come and see me anytime.
Tom threw us out.
Tom was not ashamed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.

I've got two machines.
What did you find?

That's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom dropped his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.

I'm not here to help you.
Has anyone been hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoebas are life-forms.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
That doesn't necessarily mean Tom's dead.
Waves are created by the wind.
Get a clean glass out of the closet.
This is not a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
That's all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way French spells its word for “bubbamara.”
The hoist can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're good at?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.

I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book has not yet been translated into French.

The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.

Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a handkerchief, your nose's running.
Tom was walking with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything to repent.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely goes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camellia should stay.
She has ten children.
Tom forbade me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?

Get some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.

Tom's probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.

The answer was yes.
Lovers who are really happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don’t know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.

I spend most of the day here.
Should we wait here?
If you come out so naked, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?

Did Tom say anything?
Are you all busy?

Now we're even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?

Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her slumber.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.

That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece that was often talked about.

Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
They came to the conclusion that the ship sank.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
My work hurts.
The question is who will do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was wrong at all.
Please, ask me what it was.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.

Everyone turned to look at her.

That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.

Why are you so anxious tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We exaggerate.
Please, let me finish.

You have lovely eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?

Can I talk to you?

I want to know when it's your birthday.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep me lucky!
The concert ended with a national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Hold on a second.
I've got a lot to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something?

I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask for it on Google?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most parts of the United States.
Well, here's the explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm talking about.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?

Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, and you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our work much easier.

How many miles are there from here to Boston?
That's what I'm good at.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It'll get even colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.

The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on a map?

A hose is a waste. It's too easy to bend.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.

I got a salsa.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.

Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was hitting Mary with a crappy egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of poisoning with mushrooms?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can deal with her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was immediately worried.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already believe it.
She wrote a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom said he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to swim across the river.

There's gas flowing.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise in Hawaii all year round.

You might have to help us.

I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was blowing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and deceive yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The ship's hull is divided into several watertight parts.
Considering what you've been cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your fitness.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knocking?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "No, I'm not."
He's not as shy as he used to be.
Contash?
Don't make a scene now.
What was said to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's too simple to understand.
There were boys in groups all over the place, some playing jams, some tiles, some with a ball, others riding a bike or riding wooden horses.
Doubt destroys friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not a lot of milk in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain caused by love is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He slapped his head.
We're in.
Get the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom is furious.
I can't find the equation.
Listen to the concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
I find it hard to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't decide who loves the baby, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom had a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false mark.
Tom was struggling.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix a lid?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're having lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slit on one side.
Let's eat something.
I'll be right out.
What is your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Come on in.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom's doing?
We all noticed that.
You've got a lot of beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail sometime.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you've made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dungeon.
How much does it cost over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
Which country is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I was just chilling in my room, waiting for my recovery.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, yeah, no.
There's no one.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He did his best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that risk.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a chump.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the deal?
Is it necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never cut you off.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it's best you call them.
They don't like some people.
In accordance with our agreement, she stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do?
Does he bark at your dog?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I really like German doughnuts.
We were 18 years old then.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli but I hate cauliflower.
I get nervous when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running.
Go on with it.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
You got drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
Hold it.
You're magnificent.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you done?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
It was much worse for me.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I only drank one glass.
No one's texting me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm only calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They're opposing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't invite him to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not exactly tough.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, like he was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think I've been followed.
They have no defense.
They often help others.
Tom is a pessimist.
You have the right to a phone call.
Skiing was a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I wouldn't want to get bored.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'm gonna stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't joking.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine a party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom smeared his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard him sniffing.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on the ridge.
I'll accept whatever it is.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate formulation of the question.
Tom seems to have gotten used to this kind of trouble.
You'll be fine.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I poured coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's a mess.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, the victors are always right, and the losers are always to blame.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translation of jokes is quite difficult, if at all it can be said that it is possible.
It was an arena day.
I'm bringing bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome the weakness.
How many push-ups do you do every day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom's out of a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was full of alcohol.
Tom's healing.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is heavy.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a small joint.
I'll make sure we finish the projects on time.
Definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me pick you up, Tom.
He won first place in the match.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed up late yesterday.
You're depraved.
They all shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can be saved from death.
That's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom had been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Do we need them that much?
He was desperate because of his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got earaches.
Dan hit him on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What did Tom do?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
Now it's all over.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on your mind, Tom?
A mother's advice would outweigh a friend's.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom is furious.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan is now looking for the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom right away.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've ruined it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom saw worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to make pasta.
The hunter went deep into the woods and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I have to pay.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop screaming, it's making my head sick.
You don't have me in charge, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get tired of it.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant is adored by little children.
Thank you very much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on lipstick.
She has a picture.
Swims well.
The flowers are fading.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, under urgent!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this a free place?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
I wouldn't want to get in trouble anyway.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It'd be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying from school.
I often heard him play the tune of a trumpet.
Unsatisfying libido is what produces all the art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom was fooling around.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complex.
Check if the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the jar.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, quite by chance.
Did you talk to Tom?
It’s hard to understand self-harm if you’ve never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure is rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can myrtle be used in meals?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save him, Tom.
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom's very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can’t we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you will have to do this without the help of others.
We're all endangered.
Tom won't like him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you play any kind of sport?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got quality.
Has anyone been able to take care of the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom nodded.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not gonna say anything.
That'd be good.
It's quick to walk.
Tom's very shy.
That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan brought Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm gay.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom has prepared for me.
I've seen it myself.
I love all children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no replacement.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where they do not exist.
My sister makes hair on the freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on a bus.
The rain evaporates when it is hot.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
Looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom's probably still in school.
I never say anything, even though it makes me nervous.
You're below his level.
It's my job to get hurt.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to take the job.
How much of our body is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please, help me meet Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Do not stay longer than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
Why'd you get so carried away?
I mean, I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a faggot.
What are you up to?
Why are you mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
I'm sorry to break in like this.
The books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleeping anymore.
Tom made a good point.
They must be worried.
I've transported him.
That gave me an idea.
The clock's fender's broken.
I've been looking for him.
Tom says she likes Mary.
Come on, all of you.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
It's his business.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to warn the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm getting a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's sled.
You dare to sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
It's pear green.
Tom repented of what he had told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom grinned.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like to walk.
Looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're gonna get started.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write him a letter of thanks to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Let's go!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I flipped the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's testimony.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited – everyone gains their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I've been away for an hour.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
No bait, it's gonna be hard for me to fish.
Tom was slumbering.
I think she's good at dancing.
The system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs both of them.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom looks confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and as deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
Everyone has drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a harsh critic.
I've cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I let you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a very good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's out.
Please do it again.
You're so dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
It is said that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's hard.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We've been trying.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints of shoes at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom kept the letter.
Tom would love that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom should not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a goofball.
I'm gonna have to try to deal with this alone.
They probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than 30 messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made with diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I was done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is unstable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.

We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.

You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I wanted to visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I have a few minutes left.
Wait a little longer.
Tom loves you so much anyway.
You're a good cook.
There is no shortcut to the top, only to the ravine.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was flat like a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was pathetic.
I guess you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked them all.
Automatic cars are now being rolled out.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom wears chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I waved again, Tom.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organist was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making turkey.
I love the blue color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to accept the bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave her a teddy bear to his daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with that, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipe?
They picked her up nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn’t really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a chore that I spent the evening with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
She ran away from home and got rid of her parents.
Tom's a loser.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were texting me the night before, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what.
He's undressed to bathe.
A river of sweat began to flow down my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just beat that up.
I'm learning math.
Pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you?
Movies are a great pastime.
At first I didn’t see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests can we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all smiled.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they'll come back.
Thunder out there, I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The light shines on the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
There's no getting out of the blunder.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom is soft.
I gave her a fake address.
I'm out.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's got a kick out of it.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'll really try to be nice to Tom.
He eats everything.
Where's Tom buying?
He looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything is quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom's got some anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom's running upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were inferior to you.
I need to tighten my belt.
Tom's about to run into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What made you sad?
We'd like to see Tom.
Where were you, Tom?
Who won the award?
Please, come on time.
The Germans have a softer attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
He visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with mustaches.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you take a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud noise.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I had no luck.
His body was covered in brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always loved mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most famous American singers.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom wished he'd never come back here again.
No one likes weeping.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's so screwed.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate very good food.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom doesn't have much to offer.
I got beaten up.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought some smelly garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is it all there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Can he do anything he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was going to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is not yet fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was very helpful to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was brownish.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for my handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We just started.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the mail with him.
What's the point?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I got some doughnuts.
I'm studying French.
Not looking at you.
It was too late.
I live on the top floor.
The girls won't be playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's insight.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clients are mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women love men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't give a shit about them.
People are dying all the time.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He drew his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom was reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little down-to-earth.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked his ass.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this with you.
Did he ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We were supposed to buy another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom pulled out his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me the book back, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's writing skillfully.
Tom looked.
My ears are noisy.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very tidy.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a jerk!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complex.
Tom didn't want to give up.
Tom's been suspended.
They were slipping.
She's going to be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like some marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks sloppy.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That’s all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
We hope he's all right.
You're capable, but you're stammering.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom was violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's furious.
It's from work.
We'll figure it out.
Praise encourages students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about 30 years old.
What's the deal?
I see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
He was attacked by two men.
Tom measured his weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's been knocked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for noblewomen.
I have been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak on your own behalf.
Do you believe that?
How to choose a man only one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I came to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I get paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
Couldn't be more certain.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay a little while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're special.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your childish laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are forging something.
Just leave us in the dark.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder?
Do not confuse work and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
Put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy at work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unopened.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping you.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got out of the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
She asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please, stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm bored of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he was hungry, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was in the back seat.
The bank loaned the company $1 million.
I have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxedly.
My son always interrupts me when I talk.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive alone.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, I got a headache, I'm really hungover.
Tom was having fun.
Tom said he didn't care what the guy's name was.
I'll get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I am interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to lend me an interesting book?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get inside.
He forged a sword out of the steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I told myself mine.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom found something really interesting.
There were so many more of them than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's furious.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What is their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It is about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It was so much more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just got in.
A blood vessel burst in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
She's overreacting!
There's a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a premonition that the show will be canceled; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don’t force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
It's my job to read books.
He was executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting like a jerk.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was so hot.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their flaws.
Tom was behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come in a car.
I'm so grateful.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase smaller than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're awful.
Where does he live at all? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd water her with the paddles.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please do not add comments.
That was Tom's only fault.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunder.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I have a little fever.
Tom threw him to the ground.
This lecture has no end!
The cups are in the cupboard.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to hang out with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you're still not sleeping?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be uncultured.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
In the tropics there are only two seasons.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knew how to play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she holds her head reminds me of Maria.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would've paid it back.
She always works hard.
Which country are you a citizen of?
Ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting with Tom.
I prefer dogs to cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
He still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you took a lot of care about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
He can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean to.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the good work.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn’t understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I am still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing it together soon.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits too long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
How proud I am of you.
Tom was looking for drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What did you wear?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
The forest was quiet.
Don't run from me now.
I have skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to sympathize.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise annoyed me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
They all laughed at me on the beach.
Tom disguised himself as a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like that?
I have sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto belongs to no one.
She's a skillful sawman.
Turn it off.
I don’t share my real name on any website.
They threw the plan away.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week or so.
Slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a turn-pop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was tainted with semen.
Tom's fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's happening to me tonight.
Get him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything about you.
Tom wants to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would love this.
Tom climbed up.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what's starting now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shaika stabbed the tire.
We've made ourselves trees.
This is so much better.
I'll get her to mow your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're Brooke.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and claw.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They slammed the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not a squirrel.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
It's so horrible.
I'll bring it home.
We gave them apples.
I can't dispute that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for that.
It's still not working.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Were you sincere?
The filzhan was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let up.
They're close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you back.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom becomes foggy.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I don’t have enough money at the moment.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, what about you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never walk in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I've figured it all out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom did all of this.
I'm not betraying her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is lukewarm.
Prettoa, there was no plant life in this sky.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom’s response?
You'll do as I say.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I had to do.
Tom's a long way off.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not trained to do that.
She has narrow hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Are you going to vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There is no time for explanations.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, this violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line waiting for you.
Men and women are of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was dropping pus.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What are you looking for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom dumped Mary's documents at the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't really agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are reunited.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
It is the translator’s moral choice whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he has produced.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Look around.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom’s kindness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I will continue to work here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in the eyes and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
Everything's fine.
The stars are shining.
Oh, really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
That you found them.
I couldn't get enough sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be notified in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Skittle.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew that Mary would like John.
Tom's a sucker.
I just caught my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Maybe someone followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powder medicine.
We went along the coast.
I don't want you to bully them.
Depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was looking at you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure to meet her great-granddaughter.
That's our best chance.
I smell like flowers.
Tom sniffed.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started to squirt.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak on your own behalf.
It resulted in great difficulty.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think they're the shots for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't stand it.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's jammed.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
Our conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You were wrong.
We're glad to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom went to Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened quickly.
For evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we were faced with terrible news.
The knee wound is now pus.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom's a farmer.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a candy with menthol?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel ruptured in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a walnut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom re-reads the note.
The children drew pictures on the pavement with chalk.
You're wondering why you stayed so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom often doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast of the majestic chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you have in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
He swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick off.
Well, guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Keep this between us.
I've asked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's T-shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's day.
Mr. Gorbachev, knock down the wall!
Tom looks shocked.
Tom was stunned.
That's what it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel good about retirement.
Thanks for the question.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent.
The girl who wears a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom has much to fight.
What are you kidding?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince has inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Is that my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I have never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't give a shit about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn’t get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school in a car.
Did you watch?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Do you write the proverbs?
It was a great series.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was on a Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think's gonna change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just maquis.
What did Tom do now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's already pissed.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We took care of it.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satisfy my thirst.
Tom arrived in time.
Television is boring today.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Tom found a clover with four leaves.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We said goodbye to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You are nothing and nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in the 1990s.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's the law!
Water breaks through the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Well, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're a lot like Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom had been quiet to Mary all night.
He wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I'm not gonna tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's gather a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of beetle spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought this medicine for my dad.
Kids love cakes.
He was very restrained.
I can deal with Tom.
Tom's getting nervous.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still love the horse.
I didn't touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough with the bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to crochet.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as difficult as you think it will be.
We would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
Everything is with us.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They ignore me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
Tom and I are engaged.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from a nightmare.
Tom has weak eyesight.
The flash wasn't working, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start immediately.
Is it done?
Everyone wants a lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are you going with Tom?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom opened his eyes.
The tribe was not too happy to see a peacemaker coming.
Open up.
Put on an apron.
You could be wrong.
I also baked cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
I’ve already written everything that needs to be written.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can get some rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn’t see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room below this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it alone.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set it up, Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're so cheeky.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask me on Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I don't see anything.
He's a pretty nasty man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom is jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one on that spot.
Stop! Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows aren't very good at all.
That was very negligent of Tom.
It's a hole.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them scrounge you.
Secrecy is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They will be paid well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time you are heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's just say you're right for now.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
It is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't understand.
Tom's invertebrate.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You didn't.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We both better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusher-written.
You're supposed to be helping them.
Tom wasn't crying.
I wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is worse than stupidity and indifference.
They're all messed up.
Tom didn't protest.
Where do websites come from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What do you have in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate eggplant.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
How far is Boston?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got rejected.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was on his way to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the plug out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the chimney.
Doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enya's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm falling asleep.
It has not been scientifically proven that there is a relationship between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't working hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing computer games.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We were looking for them everywhere.
I really like your website.
I'll catch you.
Squeeze the button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We're gonna do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They have no shed.
A lot of trees fell.
Lions do not distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can imagine you marrying Tom.
Tom's acting polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why Do Cows Survive?
I got pus from my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
They didn't get names.
He's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you before.
We packed their suitcases.
What you couldn't sleep from last night?
We were cursed.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very well.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're amongst your comrades.
You're weakened.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'd rather have half-shell eggs.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would I help him?
Tom lit his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom's handling the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom loaned me some money.
Am I bothering you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hang in there, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna love that a lot.
I'm gay.
Let's see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I have dinner with you?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax. Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologise.
He's licking his boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you already paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What good do I do for you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
I'm on fire when she wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor below this one.
They believed her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't snap.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
It narrows down the choice.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his child.
I used the word “Alice” to describe it.
Third time lucky.
We need to throw up.
This airy dough is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let us strive for the virtues and let us renounce vices.
You're smart.
I'm against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I arrived too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where did we go?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most inopportune time.
The dog stared at me as if he wanted to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies at some point.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a monstrous building.
Tom was not disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like a sail.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn’t know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don’t like how it sounds.
That should be possible.
I am a social worker.
Let me try it.
I am not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom withdrew.
Don't repeat yourself.
Cherries are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You've made Tom miserable.
Warm it up.
Tom looked like he was angry.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally stronger.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could have stayed, I would have stayed.
Please, stop.
There is no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't forget it didn't fall for you.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test. What about you?" "Same thing."
He was lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was a showman.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
I'm in the middle of it.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't like it when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always keep your bike dirty.
She moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What do you think?
Make two rows.
The headlines should attract the attention of readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I watched a French movie with an English translation.
Tom made fun of Mary.
Tom is full of self-confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a turbulent relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have the violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.
Which one would Tom choose?
The hospital isn't that big.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not shouting at their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't want to, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
It's gone.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon be clear.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone had put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was naughty.
It was cheap.
Marriage scares people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big glider.
Why can't you come?
The people rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't drag yourself out when you get home.
Tom taught me how to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That weapon is not a toy, boy!
Half of them are married.
They stare at him.
It's for them.
It's Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't gossip.
I want to do socially useful work to make amends for everything I have done.
Tom tied the strings.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don’t understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I had to take into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are you poisonous?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary's been very supportive.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who will pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back in place.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the bonton.
You've seen what I can do.
We've got a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have it?
It’s not all milk and honey in Canada.
I have information on this topic.
Tom was squealing.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
Don't be stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I've prepared a speech.
The falcons have a sharp appearance.
I wrote them that.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was trumpeting.
We want a new carpet.
Let's split a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
Chinacon's pretty dirty.
You need to get a good night's sleep.
Tom took off the bucket.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano is active again.
Tom told me he needed to take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by choking her.
The little island from afar looks like a tortoise.
Are the trout biting?
What did you ask Tom?
Stop blaming yourself.
I'm 30 years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
Definitely they are.
Don't wait.
You don't know how long.
The dog barked at him.
Let's go to a movie.
Beautiful women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He stepped on it.
Mary felt the warmth of her face.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom was retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom unnecessarily raises the jack.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts terribly here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
He couldn’t remember where he had left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nice to each other.
Tom's a substitute.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's kidding him.
Faith means to hope for what reason cannot hope for.
Tom used to hang out with me.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're ruining your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
Snoring is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They elected a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's pulling back.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked for a raise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten already, I'd love to have lunch with you.
What the hell do you need, Tom?
He'll say something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
And I'll see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like lubricated.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I might not do anything.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understood?
Today was a busy day for me.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father has the flu.
I don't wait long.
Just look at you.
This is great.
It's missing empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
They listened.
Tom came out.
That's all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom is furious.
I'm only here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They dismantled him.
Tom's a big cit.
Can I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm sleepy.
I plan on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He's crouching like a eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the trash in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go get Tom and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take out the mask.
That's definitely an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm blaming myself.
I liked the way you danced.
I need you a little.
They deceived us.
Tom's the one.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've ruined it.
She's a squirrel.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom was violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
The conduits are beating me up.
Tom said nothing about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
I feel good when I'm alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was breathless.
Can you get those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your policy is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I messed up.
He healed me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice melted.
I spit out blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must be so relieved.
I've never been caught.
I love my homeland.
I haven't learned how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't conjure me up.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
You can see them in the mirror.
It's not my nature to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks very tasty.
I need to understand.
You two have gone against me!
I've never had a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried it all.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I study music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed that Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won't be worth the wait.
I need to buy a new line for the room.
Tell Tom to text me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but also cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My biggest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom runs downstairs.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary left us from day one.
Come on, let's hang out.
The girls are running and playing.
I'm not sure that's what Tom did.
"Will you not eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite item.
Tom took off the bucket.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are genuine leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather waist strap.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom had a crush on Mary.
I'll go look for them.
Tom came in even though it was raining.
I don't want to use dildos - I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a psychiatrist.
Tom gave a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's going alone.
Tom only had fives at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The dentist installed a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They contacted local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me this card.
We will discuss the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That proves nothing.
Can I eat an apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me $10 a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long have you been working for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom's beating me up.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour out the wine, it's convenient to wipe it with an elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn’t sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you like robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really set me on fire.
I can go anywhere I want.
He was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear touches itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to leave?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I doubted it.
Tom's not doing what he should be doing.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your soul mate, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do then?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little bit?
I'll wash first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn’t ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a chukunbaba just a few days before she was ninety-nine years old.
Did you ask everywhere?
It’s important to remember that no one is ever 100%.
He's gesticulating while he's talking.
Sit next to me.
Tom is enthusiastic.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. However, due to his age and fragile health, he was allowed to serve that sentence under house arrest.
Scientists say that people who laugh more often live longer than those who are run over by a truck.
I talk to her often.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom sharpened the tree.
The earth is still under water, and the sword will most likely be renounced.
I was getting a nap.
What a collection!
Everyone has names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog followed me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She wants to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's crazy.
Tom's very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood and remained silent.
I'm collecting postage stamps.
This time tomorrow, we'll be in Boston.
Is this where you live?
The room looks like a dump.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom fusher stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will let you know when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The peaches are mild.
It doesn't matter.
I want comics.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind continued to blow.
Meanwhile, the stupid uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I tell you?
Bags fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got a fifth in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind blows.
It's a risky plan.
How fast can you get from here to the post office?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you going to dress up this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door creaked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for it.
He's lying down at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary was looking at him.
You're making me feel bad.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You haven't asked why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky cleared.
The noise will wake the baby.
Just look straight ahead.
It's not really something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing draws.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think you'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's got it.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a donut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Are you cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's a mess.
Tom is the tallest man in his class.
Tom, you've grown fast.
That was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in your diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it alone?
Is that your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you crooking?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're almost ready.
Tom's got a sharp ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
He doesn't like me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the plug.
I helped him unravel the table.
I ate steak with potatoes last night.
It is better for your health to walk the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Get me back to two and a half.
Tom propy.
I slept in the boat.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what can work.
Don't you feel cold on your short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese ass movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need guidance.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real pity.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
Don't save the bell.
You hit me on the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems overwhelmed.
You're having fun, you're continuing your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demek, should I know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing.
She runs slowly.
How can you be so sure?
In the picture, you can see bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just ripped Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my comrades.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son really likes rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He got in front of them.
Here, brother, half-way.
Tom sent on the table the new fly he had just bought.
Tom is going to help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's high.
The landscape is excellent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to restrain myself.
Autumn has arrived.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the car crash?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
I could be fired for this.
What is the Intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was magnificent.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should relate to each other in the spirit of general human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do it all by himself.
What's the best?
I make a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom continued to exercise.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend? Don't you see how poor I am?
Seems familiar to me.
I envy her.
I offered to blow his dick, but he told me he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're an insightful man.
Everything seemed okay.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew I couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
I'm kind of flattered even.
Exercising.
She may have cheated on you, but I'm not here either!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
He put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a shopkeeper.
It is easy to solve this task.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's a lot of fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know what it probably sounds like to you.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshade.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to get stung by catfish.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
Wipers do not help against ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I don't think he's interested in asking Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don’t have to like everything.
Are the potatoes calorie-free?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him a grimace.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was hitting me with a rock.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing under a stretcher in front of the store to avoid rain.
I remember a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
Everyone was dubious.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out that there is a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom still can't write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mice are carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom squealed.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn’t honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm fed up with Tom.
I like roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a car accident.
They're hugging us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's all right.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French very well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You worry too much about him.
The president announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I here too soon?
Sounds really good.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this the place?
Would you like to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom tied the strings.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom's out there somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It is an undeniable fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's a little frowny.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Did you stop beating up your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are a species of mammals.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I get to know Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck! Try your luck!
I may not be graduating.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the screen.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom turned to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like puzzles.
This book will help you to write.
This area is in the valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, lubricate the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates ridiculed her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary this morning.
I'm making my toasts with honey.
They ate the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I assume the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom dumped his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is enthusiastic.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making cake.
Look at the count.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it all off.
Tom suffocated.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to take off my weight.
That’s exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I am with the person I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick one.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why'd you leave me?
I don't like spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Aren't we supposed to help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt that he needed to be redeemed.
It's a message for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
He raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
He beat the dog with a stone.
Tom stared intently.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
I wrote this book myself!
Don't put that much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be imaginary.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you have to plow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We don't see.
Mahmud can't stand to lose.
No one listens to you.
Okay, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgottenness and hatred usually go in pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly in.
Agreed.
Tom admitted that he spilled the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Loire.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn’t eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Just grab me by the crustacean.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He is very knowledgeable in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
You're not alone.
I remember being in Boston for a short time.
How much stomach should I do per day?
Are you going to cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You've got a lot of penetrating eyes.
Isn't that implied?
He seemed tired to me.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty well.
Will you get back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Smoke and get inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom is rich.
Tom seems confident.
Would you like to drink some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
It develops dependency.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and were silent.
Get the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary turned to her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
Nobody listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finished the Mass.
Tom wiped the knife blade off his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
We give a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I don't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you get down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how this is possible.
He looked at me sharply through his glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he'd dumped her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to release us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who can break the aquarium?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression at many times in his life.
You want me to grab your bags?
I would entrust it to my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class sucks.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the locker.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as your soul desires.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk face-to-face.
Tom is not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the exam?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was picking something up.
She's studying English.
With such a lush dream, you will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
He opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit on the chewing gum.
Make it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to have bad habits!
She began to behave strangely.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom ate meat at the time.
You always misunderstand me.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked strong.
What to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary's Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're narrow-minded.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is numb.
Grab the day.
What's going on, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Beware of the buyer.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now it's time to make amends.
Most virgins have read the hymen.
You can come to the end.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
He is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be fine.
Does she have a dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French more than he was actually speaking.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria did not understand the lecture. The speaker should have spoken more slowly.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
This medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help finding her.
That means we can't eat the bread anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked nervous.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working fine.
Tom got sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom has always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Shall we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just freaked out.
I prefer goat cheese to cow cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven’t eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Did you meet Tom?
Are they all having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
Carpenters cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Xena's done.
Same-sex couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot that it was once a calf.
Give them the picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
Let me try that.
Would you mind putting out the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I believe her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no word from Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other lies.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is considered to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I have to feed them.
She's always soulless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary did.
That was very helpful.
You're hanging me up.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
You brought it after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Today was the first snowfall.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
The blood circulates through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
Lies won't help.
My thumb on my right leg hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from, where are we going?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom's baking for attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom get here?
Can I leave a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really mean that kind of thing.
There's wind.
I'm just joking with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the chorus.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You guys were right.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a difficult task.
You should make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, dear.
They increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have known about it by now.
My mother and sister are my aunt.
I've been looking for them everywhere.
Tom is incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It's gone red.
I've got to go.
He who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very secluded.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom had a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these tips in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we can beat Tom.
Get your shit out of here.
Where'd you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
I missed the headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I came out of the wall.
The clock is broken.
Tom has to stop.
Isn’t that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom took the scarf off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower stood among the ruins.
Tom is a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little bit.
Did you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Hand me the pliers.
The Huskies love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She is afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the buffalo.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his father very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom did well today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When is the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing only what I want.
It's not my call.
Despite our expectations, there have been no accusations.
Lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw that Mary was about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed seed, grew it, and reaped it; the coloured river turned the mill.
He hates his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I often ski.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When do I get my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a typo.
It's not often that someone buys a $1,000 hat.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I could barely save myself from being caught.
I can't interfere.
You beat them.
They were silent.
Tom is back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on board when it exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the Asian?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You tricked me.
That's for Greta.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one actually knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're messing with her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat in restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom was almost there.
You've got an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red at dusk.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd be happy if you could come too.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I don't speak English very well.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made from flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this very well.
You want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's warm here in hell.
I overlooked that.
This is your work!
Please come back to me.
Cold here.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Kids, you're here to stay.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Does he bark at your dog?
That's great!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go collect them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom moved away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did this.
Tom wasn't sleeping.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom came here by himself.
I forgot my joke.
We've suffered so much.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often requires difficult compromises.
Tom just got his dentures out.
I have to try and find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake her up, Mary.
You almost missed it.
I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was endangered.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why does no one want to help us?
The hole is narrow.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or you'll be kicked out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom was raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He was blind from birth.
The book contains fifteen books.
Tom's been working all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
Socks and sneakers are new.
I haven't had pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy any more.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
Tom is buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What is Tom talking about?
How are you two?
Dalida died of an overdose of sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign below, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a dead man.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, wow, it's raining.
Ish, jackass!
They jumped in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home last night.
I think we've eaten enough.
This is very difficult for them.
Witches don't cry.
Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks horrified.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's it.
I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're disorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom will make it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to go back for him.
You're uncultured.
Do you play sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring it in.
He lied to us all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely inaccurate.
I'd better call her first.
He's very sociable.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I only practice to look beautiful when I'm naked.
A thousand years is a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I plan on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
That's an honest word.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom closed his mouth.
Well, don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not naughty.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's retired.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents’ home.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a spider bite.
Tom didn't really want to live in Boston.
The price of wisdom is greater than that of pearls.

That new song is called "Little Lit."
It's deeper than that.
Henry doesn't have more than six dollars.
We all have our price.
The answer to both questions is no.
They're amazing.
Legend has it that she was a mermaid.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I am used to speaking in public.
She was crying out of happiness.
Tom got out of jail.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to turn green.
Do you want me to rub your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I nodded my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'll go and finish.
I'm going to change.
Put the phone down.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first offer.
Sooner or later, I'm going to lose the movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, could have happened here.
Tom was warming up in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
He swims every day.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to mold.
You should try to write respectfully.
I'll sit there.
She's older than him.
I baked them a cake.
Tom is very patient.
We can get started.
Come alone.
You pull a pencil out of your pocket.
Tom asked for a lawyer.
Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn’t that good news?
Suppose she was here.
Tom always pisses me off.
Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thanks in advance.
The question is, what are you going to do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom looked a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It rained two days ago.
It's not embarrassing.
If you bite me, I'll bite you too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The horse's hoofed cannon calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book covers the subject entirely.
I think this is over.
Linda wore modest dresses all the time.
Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanked anyone.
He overcame his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Do you cook for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to get Tom's permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They're gone.
How many cups of coffee a day are too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same in my place.
Now, let's continue the conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Will you go?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling ourselves.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I collect a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times as much as I do.
I rinsed one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is the difference visible?
Come visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It will help her sleep the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll prep the dishes.
They've been chanting for half an hour.
Dolkun has been working very intensively lately, but he does not see the slightest result from it.
Dan found out that Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to my house next Saturday, if you like.
I'm not sure.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom is sleeping well.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
She spent the last day of the night drinking in a meat inn.
I'm in.
Do you need a grater?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'll go to bed.
But that is not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What am I going to tell the kids now?
Let him go, Tom.
I overcame the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom being that tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How did you spend your vacation?
We were just a group of gorillas.
She started burying her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
What if I didn't invite Tom to my party?
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee.
Do you travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the back pain you have?
That's what everybody does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects postage stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water shines in the sun.
A is a set consisting of members B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
Kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom exercises the violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I'm after him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother’s death was a shock.
You're burning the car.
She learned to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I have no willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go see Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is rshum.
At your service.
I love watching football on TV.
Still, I'd like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that kind of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I'll have to clean.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don’t forget to apply sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom’s voice was barely heard.
Don't make a sound.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just oversleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom will wait.
I'm glad you're leaning.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly descending.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom began to laugh.
Is that why you're here?
You're not premeditated, are you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew immediately that something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; you have to do it anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to take our thoughts away from our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Just let me focus.
She sells marine schools.
Ward the prisoner.
We all like you.
The child was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom is nothing like his brother.
Tom was a nerd.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you excited?
Tom couldn't have done it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You might be needed.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
He stole my new wristwatch.
It doesn't look very different.
He's overdoing it.
Tom and made room for Mary on the bench.
We're messing with him.
It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did you get her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his journey.
Your excuse is more or less correct.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary walked out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do this alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other.
Tom must have done it.
Let me see him.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one will get fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my feet.
How can you say that?
Tom catches the fog.
They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
The person who pays the bills has the right to rule.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can take mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All comments are superfluous.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call for help?
Tom rinsed his mouth.
That smells like cheese.
Tom is not wrong.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Gold without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom looks offended.
We know him.
I slumbered there for hours.
He had a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did you get up early this morning?
Your complaints have upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy here.
What can be done?
I'm guessing you found him.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'll go and stop.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom's collaborating.
Snow is one foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby paws the rattlesnake.
I'm gonna go look for Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do the job for now.
They need to talk.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened immediately.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There is no life without pain.
You totally misunderstood me.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me a jerk.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open on page nine.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Tom was beaten.
The Iranians were a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Does Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely happy with Tom's explanation.
Looks like you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom hasn't returned yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me a long time.
Tom is in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.
There is no answer for everything.

Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Aren't you panicking?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's smart.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
That's good news, though, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It’s easy to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of punctuation is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why are you hesitating?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want us to take you home?
This house is made of bricks.
We have not reached any conclusion.
Tom arrived at about 2:30.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I got cat litter.
The crowd applauded.
I leave clover to grow on the edges.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We're underrated.
I was too tired to continue.
Everything has its own sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't joking.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call last night from a man named Tom Jackson.
Is it possible to use this site in the same way as Twitter?

Stand up when you talk to me.
He's always cheerful.
The forest was very quiet.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's intrusive.
Most of the clothes that Europeans wear are produced outside of Europe.
Tom is still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can search on the Internet.
When I was younger, I always hitchhike.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious that we don't need evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait for them here?
When I pee, something like pus comes out.
You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I play volleyball often.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
That'll teach them the order.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like this.
Tom's snarling.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.

Time passed very quickly.
There's no way out.
The heavy rain at night has made it difficult to save the survivors of the wreck.

It's still on sale.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
From time to time, a carriage would pass me.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no theoretical way I can get the job done in one day.
He was almost horrified.
I suddenly felt old.
They annoy me.
It was all night.
I'm ready.
He killed him to avenge his late father.
Tom got a cookie.
I have been learning French since I was 13 years old.
Men are not so different from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite oils for cleansing the face and skin care.
It's French over my head.
I don't care if there are 20 women.
The bull is tormented.
Tom's on foot.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't understand.
He was born in 1960.
How about one?
Babur is usually mild in taste.
I'm shocked.
It could rain today.

Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
You got some time?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep it.
Wouldn't you like to get your hair cut out of it?
How will you escape?
Let’s start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you going to do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
This is exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these men from my grandmother.
I have no problem with drinking.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
It's in excellent condition.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
She loves fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The noise will wake the baby.
I'm late for spinach.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the two-seater with Mary and watching TV.
Nothing's bothering me.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom wears a stethoscope.
Nice to see you, Tom.
How's yours?
I'm not usually at work on Mondays.
I'm a fool to believe them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to church every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a crowd at the bar.
They threw the idea away.
Tom was more and more surprised.
Who gave them that much money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did the dishwasher work?
Tom's a married man.
As Tom said, the soup is too salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come out?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this all about?
You're going to have to study for the better next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Oh, man!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than do your bidding.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom took two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like best.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Don't get discouraged now.
It looks like her style.
I've had enough of fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a reporter.

Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We all want to see the movie.
I'll be in Scotland tomorrow.
We cut off the conversation.
I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
You can’t focus on your academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They've become addicted.
I just want money.
I don't say bad things about their children.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I'm fully recovered.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, I get blamed.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm tired of being called a liar.
The beggars can't read.
Is there any sugar?
Dan and Linda eventually moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
It looked funny.
Tom plays in a band.
Now we live together.
You've been busy.
Excuse me, isn't it a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship changed course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
That's what Tom said.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna have a lot of work to do.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked out.
He enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-wing.
Should I take a picture with or without a flash?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was on.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom is in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem myself.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's an adult now.
We do not sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I came back by bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The battle is not coming to an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's broken.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I will never work for them.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and it's over.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put the collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin our party.
I can do that.
I'm not discriminating.
I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a month.
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are taking the medication prescribed to you.

Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started climbing up.
Tom likes you a lot.
Tom turned to Mary.
Now for the first time, I put pepper on eggs.
I'll figure it out.
The medicine worked.
Tom knows how to play guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you so much.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, you lazy bastard!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd be avoiding Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue the conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I've let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really loves us.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.
Tom's patty candy.
You won't find them.
Tom's not texting me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
It's all set.
She's in a bad mood.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Scratch it.
Have you decided yet?
Tom's eavesdropping.
Is anyone listening to me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know that.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I'm in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on the chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to go to bed and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital and recovering from what he overdosed on.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were getting ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They seem busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's a tough guy.
When you go to a meeting with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is distrustful.
Mary is annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup raised.
That's good training.
This capital is unique.
I should have said no.
I had to consider what could happen.
That was my tactic.
I have lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my libe.
I know you did your best.
Tom didn't have to write his password on the inside of the notebook cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should feel sorry for them.
I'm not kidding.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don’t comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is a cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom's a bit of a snitch.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was irresistible.
I agree with the plans.
Justice is expressed through actions.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America, you're supposed to leave a tip to the waiter.
This behavior was childish on his part.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you still can.
Tom was a little embarrassed about Mary.
I don't need them.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars have replaced the cars.
I've been kidnapped.

Tom seems insecure.
There's nothing else to look for.

He can't do that.
Why worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banderana in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Maria that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you catch a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see it.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is a lot worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get lost.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something stabbed me.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care of him, Tom.
They look familiar to me.
We have work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see him.
Did you get some rest?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in an enclosed room.
It was a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going to walk?
You should try it.
You're quite burdened with worry.
I don't think Tom's going to help us much.
Tom looks worried.
I take care of him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom was shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is sympathetic.
Keep it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've gotten along.
This is nobody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom runs to the edge.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, a barbecue, a football field and a billiard table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking questions about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was bored with his sister.
We should've given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's being polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do anything."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom's running the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trusting and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not gonna give in.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna gossip.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I believe them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two species in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's got his hands full.
Tom was enthusiastic.
I eat pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need a pony to carry them.
The noise disturbed the whole city.
A person who loves flowers cannot be a bad person.
This is not a joke.
They blinked.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Tom was screwing up.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears attacking clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined it.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First, you have no right to make conclusions, and second, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm a cattle farmer.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I believed them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom involved?
The thief turned into a policeman.
We're gonna let Tom try.
That would be logical.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom can't be seen anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building. When I passed by it in a car, I did not recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the topic.
I'll be back in a minute.
She seemed to be deeply shocked by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My weight's leaking.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes burst.
The geyser throws out a jet of boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm willing to be here.
It's to protect you.
Someone has always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You need to ask your mother's permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've been wanting chickens a lot.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had lunch quickly.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'll go look for her.
Of all the languages I learned, French was the easiest.
Tom wrote homework.
I counted to 200.
Take care of this.
Shall I go?
He looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don’t drink enough water.
I've got homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
This woman is easily embarrassed.
Can you get there by car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I guessed something strange.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful alka.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Was he alone at home?
He extorted a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me solve this?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spider webs.
You really talk a lot.
Maybe it's too late.
I couldn’t find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
You don’t always have to believe what the other person says.
He is in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's eldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a painkiller.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're demented!
That seems to be the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I will do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think it's helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound stopped.
Who's frying you?
I don't really understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Tell me you understand.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How will Tom get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't get away with it.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
You're welcome.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom likes to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your chump.
What's our status?
Do you want me to hear it?
You're a real human-hater.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who is Responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you think of contacting them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don’t want to be treated differently than before.
You should be okay.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's soulless.
I haven’t seen that movie yet.
You've already done it.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who laughs, but not who cries.
How old are you, Tom?
He wore a red scarf around his neck.
The girl said nothing.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was excited to listen to music.
Try on the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a very good job.
My feet still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I fainted.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know a cannon sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I am open to everything.
I used to watch you.
Stop where they are.
Are you a cheater?
"She likes music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber scrubbed it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'll get lost.
The nurse gave her a flu shot.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while cleaning his gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Silence, fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the songs were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
Everybody was laughing.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote the messages?
Tom's doing push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to a cave?
Dan didn't want to go to an orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought it was caused to me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought her something for Mary.
Nothing resembles a madman more than a drunk.
Take it, Tom.
Tom began to take off his clothes.
I know Tom does.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Share the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medication will ease the pain.
I'd like to celebrate your dinner.
Can't he wait for that?
They'll pay for their pride.
Dan didn't miss any episodes of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We got a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to meet him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
This is where we'll be.
Why do they do that?
I've been a college student for four years, and I've missed nothing but a poor bachelor's degree.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, all that was left was ashes.
Tom likes all kinds of vegetables except cabbage.
Try putting yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We're taking Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to cut him out of their society.
Those who confuse the verb endings "is" and "is" awaits a special place in hell.
What happened then?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're everywhere.
I didn't count on that.
I was sloppy.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take too long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom's got it cleaned up.
We're so pissed.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom boiled two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I gave her nothing.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for a whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really nasty.
You want some cheese?
They say blue eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is chaste and devout.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to pass the test.
I think we'll join in.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's keeping his car well.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people on earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm fine.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I came to bring him a gift.
I asked her to describe it.
I was just taking a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks Caucasian, which has no common phonemes or common letters with English, can completely master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There's too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the lunatic.
Tom laughed at him.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.

Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom is right for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first time running late.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom picked up his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him in the mess.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my seat.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I love to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned a lesson in the hard way.
You showed the fake to my friends.
I give my employees the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm full.
He ate a salad of kale.
I'm gonna run.

I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
I have never visited Boston.
I'm glad to be independent.
Tom is very popular.
I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and see.
Do you think you like it?
Innocence is usually a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's heart rate's up.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept babbling about how kind, compassionate, brave her boyfriend was, and I still don’t know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You've been busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom is watching TV.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in the 1980s.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different for different people.
I've become inconvenient with heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't take much longer.
The virtues are a reward in themselves.
All of this makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom nodded silently.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right for me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated me.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it really a diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
He seems very sleepy.
I made some mushroom cookies yesterday.
I hope he succeeds.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in the science!

Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is estimated that the surface temperature of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd went crazy.
Tom started to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy him a birthday present for John.
Cover it.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to question him.
That was embarrassing.
I need Tom's address.
It's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom might have left.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did you want to eat Tom?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We arrived just in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left their fingerprints in the liquid cement.
A cavalier would never do something like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is beautiful.
Tom, don't pretend to be Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant then.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to rent a room.
Tom never told anyone where he had hidden the gold coins.
Fortunately, the hollow is stable, otherwise the storm would have collapsed last night.
I heard they caught her.
Tom has it all written down somewhere.
There is no good news.
And who are you working for these days?
I'll give up.
Mary’s eyes were filled with joy.
It's evil to swear.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How's it going, guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman cheated on him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at 10:00?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll make her help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple matter.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
It seems aimless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did you really do that, Tom?
I didn’t know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not good for sports.
I'm amazed, Tom.
I don't see anything.
Call your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I love trying new things.
Tom was not the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry up.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He's done miracles.
The glands secrete chemical substances in the body.
It wasn't my idea.
Tom is resting.
Don't run around.
It's best if you don't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I was helping her.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
I felt kind of sorry for her.
He is overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bicycle.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Come here! Come here!
You could have said no.
Why don't you let me help?
It's gonna happen soon.
Hey, it's stuffy here, get me out before I suffocate.
It will happen what will happen.
I heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.
The police didn't find anything to tie Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was very polite.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
You can leave and stay as you wish.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you talk louder?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "Truth or Challenge."
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to read the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom really likes flowers.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a mermaid song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.

My wife's getting sick of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amoebas are single-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom twisted my hand.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today is more durable.
I'm cold.
He walked in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This is not fair to me.
Maybe someone followed them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a cash register.
Camilla, I'd like you to meet her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This won't work.
He's recently gone.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You hit me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed okay.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive father.
An international language would be very useful for mankind.
I was helping them.
Have you decided yet?

It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom began to eat.
She's good-natured.
What time is it?
It's a nice weekend.
Would you like soda water?
Tom winked at the girls.
We had a terrible fight.

Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam included mathematics, physics and chemistry.
Tom washes the bets.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you could swim?
Don't put pressure on Tom.
I've been betrayed.
And there's no paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you gave your speech.
This sentence has five words.
She ate lamb flakes, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We were waiting for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier like this.
Tom tricked you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not exactly an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is hard.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.

It's dark in here.
Tom's a bully.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?

Tom's doing a lot better.

We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.

There's no way it was Tom.
I'm gonna kill you.
Most people have great resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I've been watching Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should understand oils and lubricants for motors.
How was yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't fire them right now.
They have families.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's have breakfast.
I'll make my omelet.
Tom explained to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
It made you sick, didn't it?
I completely forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I took out my knife.
They danced.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I go to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy came running up to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I folded it.
Tom remained calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living things.
They amuse her.
I need to go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Our Chukunbaba died a day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I’ve always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom soon got lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a badass.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That amazes me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you blink when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her completely.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom Ritchie.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her a little privacy.

It's like I screwed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I are going on the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
An hour before the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird raised the branch with the beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether you buy it or not.
Tom's not the same guy from three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to set aside time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to get rid of it.
What am I gonna do to them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not a good time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not old.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best feature.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's really cool.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
The simple question is where.
The bush is burning.
Tom was hurt.
My conscience is hurting me.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom is drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're babbling a lot.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something to him.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I pay my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I will pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the King's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could ever imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
He lied to my eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to wash.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
They'd just get in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little loud, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's you for now.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in the place of their choice.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They framed him for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing a one-piece T-shirt.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was really good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm getting into it.
He took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Have you seen what's in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom nodded loudly.
It was Better.
Tom started to sniff.
I'm gonna ask you to stay here for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed to her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die by noon.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was furious.
Limenkawa is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom lowered his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money blurred my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the lead flag?
You're in a good mood!
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I think I found one.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't understand you.
Even though I'm a godly man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
He's not that angry.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
Can we talk?
Where did we go?
Tom basically does the same thing that Mary does.
There's something we need to investigate.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That’s actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
He drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom began to say something, but Mary silenced him.
We met in Meana.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for a home.
Let him go.
The nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I got it wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't grow.
Tom was conscious.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
That's what Tom's good at.
Tom might be here today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't knock me out.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, one more time.
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We looked out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it is of another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don’t think they have a cure yet.
Every member must be present.
She didn’t understand the joke.
This is the ugliest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me pass a message on tom.
Where's my golf equipment bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're fair.
I'll go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy the presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What is Luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You scratched your collarbone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show is over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was naughty.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking anything.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom roaring.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look furious?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy anyway.
Let's go again!
It doesn't cost him his heart.
No need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
The penguin is very cute.
You're such a nerd.
We are sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look suffocated.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave home in a pair of slippers.
I think Tom's a nut.
The disease of a terrible infection and the ovary and proceeded.
I don't need advice.
This is not worth it.
It doesn't come to mind.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He sometimes behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
Now is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake out of a cape?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the topic.
She really wants to gossip.
I have Tony's questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even horrifying story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language looks at the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
Nawaka.
This is holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come over for a drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We've got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, living?
This was at the top of the cup.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we had a fight.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's warm enough for demecraries?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you squealing at him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in the room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You cut your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I've been a little fussy.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
No one wants to buy these things.
Neither here nor there.
Phonebooks are fascinating.
You don't have to be defensive.
This is the best pizza in town.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
